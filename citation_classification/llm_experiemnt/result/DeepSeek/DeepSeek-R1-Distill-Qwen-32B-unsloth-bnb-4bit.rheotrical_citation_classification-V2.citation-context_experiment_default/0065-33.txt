Okay, so I need to classify the citation in the given scientific article passage using the predefined rhetorical classes. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I'll read the passage carefully to understand the context in which the citation is used. The passage states: "(CITSEG) provided a detailed description of the molecular structure of the newly discovered plant pathogen." 

The next step is to determine the rhetorical function of this citation. The citation is about providing a detailed description of a molecular structure. The authors are referring to previous work that explains or describes something in their field, which is important for their own study.

Looking at the predefined classes, I need to match this context. The class "Support" is used when the citation supports, confirms, or reinforces a claim made by the authors. In this case, the authors are using the cited work to back up their own research by referring to a detailed description that's relevant to their study.

Another possible class could be "Usage," but that's more about methods, tools, or datasets. Here, it's about the description of a structure, which is more about supporting their point rather than using a method.

Therefore, the appropriate class is "Support."
