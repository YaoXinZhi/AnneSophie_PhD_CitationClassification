Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the right rhetorical class for the citation in this passage. Let's see. The passage says, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)."

Hmm, this looks like the authors are comparing their results with those from another study. The key part is that their results "substantially differ," which suggests a direct comparison between their findings and those of the cited work. Looking at the classes, I see there's CoCoRes for when the citation is used to compare results. That fits because they're contrasting their outcomes with the cited results.

I don't think it's Support because they're not using the citation to back up their own claim, but rather to show a difference. It's not Motivation or Basis either because it's not explaining why they're doing the research or building on prior work. Similarly, it's not a Neutral usage or about Usage, Similar, Weakness, or Future. 

So the best fit is CoCoRes because they're directly comparing their results to the cited study's.
