Okay, let me try to figure out what class this citation falls into. The passage says that in the USA, the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975, citing CITSEG. I need to determine the rhetorical function of this citation. 

Looking at the possible classes: Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, Weakness.

The sentence just states a fact about the spread of magnetic devices in the USA since 1975, using the citation as a source. It's not comparing anything, supporting a claim, or pointing out a weakness. It's simply providing a descriptive statement without any supporting, comparing, or critical intent. So, it's a neutral, descriptive use of the citation.

Therefore, the correct class is Neutral.

Neutral
