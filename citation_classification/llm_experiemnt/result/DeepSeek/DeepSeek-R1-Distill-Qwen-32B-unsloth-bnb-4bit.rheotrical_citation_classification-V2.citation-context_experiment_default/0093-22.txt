Alright, let's see. So the user provided a prompt where they want to classify citations in scientific articles into predefined rhetorical classes. They gave an example where the passage mentions using a method or dataset from a previous study. In the example, the citation is clearly referring to a method used in the current study. 

I need to figure out which class fits this scenario. The classes include Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, and Weakness. 

Looking at the example, the citation is about using a method that was previously used in another study. So the current study is directly utilizing something from the cited work. That sounds a lot like the "Usage" class, which refers to using a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup from the cited work in the current study. 

I should check the other classes to make sure none of them fit better. "Support" is about citing to support a claim, which isn't exactly the case here. "Similar" is about similarities in results, which isn't relevant. "Basis" is more about foundational work, and here it's more about usage than foundational. So "Usage" seems to be the correct classification here.
