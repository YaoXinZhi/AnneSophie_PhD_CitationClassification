Alright, I need to classify the given citation passage into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. Let me carefully analyze the context and the role the citation plays.

First, looking at the passage, the sentence is: "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not (CITSEG)."

Here, the authors have presented their own finding about insect hosts affecting bacterial assembly. They then mention that this finding is supported by recent investigations. The citation in question (CITSEG) is part of these supporting studies. The authors are referring to another study that also found that arthropod hosts governed bacterial assemblages, thereby reinforcing their own results.

So, the citation is being used to support the authors' findings. It's an example where the cited work aligns with the authors' results, thus strengthening their argument. It doesn't seem to be a comparison of methods or results with their own, nor is it introducing a foundation or usage of a method. It's directly corroborating their own results.

Therefore, the most appropriate class is "Support".
