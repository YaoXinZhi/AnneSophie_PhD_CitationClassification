Alright, I need to classify the given citation passage into the appropriate rhetorical class. Let me first understand the passage.

The passage says: "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not (CITSEG)."

So, the authors are stating their finding and then mentioning that it's supported by other recent studies. They reference a study which found that in fleas and ticks, the arthropod host influenced bacterial communities, similar to their own findings.

Looking at the rhetorical classes:

- **Support**: When the citation supports, confirms, or reinforces the authors' claims with evidence.
- **Similar**: When pointing out a similarity in results, patterns, etc., between the cited work and theirs.
- **Comparison of Results (CoCoRes)**: When comparing results directly.

In the passage, the authors are supporting their finding with another study that shows a similar pattern. They're not directly comparing their results to others or pointing out differences, nor are they using it as a foundation or motivation.

So, the cited work is providing supporting evidence, aligning with their findings. Therefore, it fits the **Support** class.
