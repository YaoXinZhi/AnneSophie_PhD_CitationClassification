Alright, I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the given passage. The passage says, "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not (CITSEG)." 

First, I should look for the role the citation plays here. The sentence starts by stating their own finding, then mentions that it's supported by recent cross-taxon investigations. The citation is referring to another study that found similar results in fleas and ticks. 

So, the citation is pointing out a similarity between their findings and the cited work. Both studies show that the host affects bacterial community assembly. This makes me think of the 'Similar' class, which is used when a citation highlights similarities in results, patterns, or phenomena between the cited work and the citing paper.

Looking at the examples for each class, the 'Support' class is when the citation confirms the authors' findings, which is part of this, but the main point here is pointing out a similarity, not just supporting a claim. The 'Similar' class seems more appropriate because it's emphasizing that other studies have shown similar outcomes.

I don't think it's 'CoCoRes' because that's more about comparing results directly with the citing paper, but here it's more about stating that other studies have found the same pattern, which supports the similarity rather than directly comparing.

Therefore, the correct class should be 'Similar'.
