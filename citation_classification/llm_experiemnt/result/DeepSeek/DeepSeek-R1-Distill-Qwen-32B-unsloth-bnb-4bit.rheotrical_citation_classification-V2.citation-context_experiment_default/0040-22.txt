Alright, I need to classify the citation's rhetorical class in the given plant health domain passage. 

First, I read the passage: "(CITSEG) developed a methodology to detect and map plant disease outbreaks using remote sensing techniques."

Next, I analyze how the citation is used. The sentence mentions that the cited work "developed a methodology." This indicates that the current study is building upon or using this methodology.

Looking at the predefined classes, "Basis" is appropriate when the cited work is foundational or directly contributes to the current research. Here, the methodology is being referred to as the basis for the current study's approach.

I check other classes to be sure. It's not a comparison (CoCoGM or CoCoRes), nor it's for motivation or future directions. It's clearly foundational.

So, the correct class is "Basis."
