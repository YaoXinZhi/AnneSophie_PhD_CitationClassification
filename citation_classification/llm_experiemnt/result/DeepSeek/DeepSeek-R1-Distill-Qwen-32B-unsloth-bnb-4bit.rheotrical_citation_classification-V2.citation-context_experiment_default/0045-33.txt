Alright, I need to determine the rhetorical class for the citation in the given passage. Let's look at the example provided.

The passage says, "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not (CITSEG)."

The citation here is referring to another study that supports the authors' findings. Specifically, the cited work shows that in fleas and ticks, the host influences bacterial assemblages, which aligns with the authors' own results. This use of the citation is to confirm and reinforce their claim, so it falls under the "Support" class.
