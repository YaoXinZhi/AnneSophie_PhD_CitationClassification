Alright, let's tackle this classification. The passage mentions a study by Hua et al. (2021) that observed root elongation. The citing paper is pointing out a similarity in results regarding root elongation under magnetic fields. So, the cited work supports their own findings, indicating that both studies have similar results. The key here is the similarity of the findings rather than directly supporting or comparing methods or explaining claims. Thus, the appropriate label is "Similar."
