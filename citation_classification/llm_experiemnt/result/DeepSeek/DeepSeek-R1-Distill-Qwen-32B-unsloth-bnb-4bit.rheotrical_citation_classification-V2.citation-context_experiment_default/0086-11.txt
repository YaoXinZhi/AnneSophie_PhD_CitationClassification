Alright, I'm trying to classify the rhetorical function of the citation in this passage. The passage says that previous studies have shown that the formation of a hard calcite scale on surfaces exposed to hard water can be prevented with a magnetic field. The purpose of this work is to try to understand the mechanism behind this beneficial influence.

Looking at the predefined classes, I need to determine which one fits best. The citation here is used to justify why the current research is being conducted. It points out that the phenomenon hasn't been explained yet, indicating a knowledge gap. That aligns with the "Motivation" class, which is used to justify the current research by identifying a gap or open question.

I don't think it's "Basis" because although it's related to prior work, it's not directly the foundation of the new solution. "Usage" isn't applicable since they're not using a method or tool from the cited work. "Support" doesn't fit because they're not using the citation to confirm their own findings but rather to introduce their research purpose. "CoCoGM", "CoCoRes", "CoCoXY", "Future", "Neutral", "Similar", "Weakness" also don't apply here because the function is to motivate the research, not compare, support, or criticize.

So, the correct class is "Motivation".
