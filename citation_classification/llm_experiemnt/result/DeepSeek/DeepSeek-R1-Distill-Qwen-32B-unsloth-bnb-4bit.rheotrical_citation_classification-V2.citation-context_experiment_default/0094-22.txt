Alright, I'm looking at the given task where I need to classify a citation in a scientific article passage into one of several predefined rhetorical classes. The citation is denoted as (CITSEG). The passage provided in the user's query is: 

"The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)."

First, I'll break this down. The sentence is comparing the current work's results with those from another study that used deuterium-saturated metal targets. The key here is the phrase "substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with..." which clearly indicates a comparison between the two sets of results.

Now, looking at the predefined classes:

- **Basis**: If the citation is foundational to the current research. Doesn't apply here.
- **CoCoGM**: Comparing goals or methods. The passage doesn't discuss methods or goals.
- **CoCoRes**: Comparing results or findings. Yes, the text is about differing results.
- **CoCoXY**: Comparing two cited studies. Here, the current paper's results are being compared to the cited work.
- **Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, Weakness**: None of these fit as well as CoCoRes.

So, the most appropriate class is **CoCoRes** because the citation is used to compare the results of the current work with those of the cited study.
