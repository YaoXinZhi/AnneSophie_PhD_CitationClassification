Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to classify the citation in the given passage. Let me read the passage again and understand the context. The passage says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)." 

So, the current work is comparing its own results with those from another study cited as CITSEG. The key word here is "substantially differ from the results," which clearly indicates a comparison between the two sets of findings. 

Looking at the list of rhetorical classes, the one that fits this scenario is CoCoRes, which is used when comparing or contrasting the results or findings of the cited work with the citing paper. The passage isn't just stating a fact or using it as a basis; it's actively comparing outcomes. 

I don't think it's any of the other classes because it's not about motivation, using a method, or pointing out a weakness. It's specifically about how their results compare to the cited work's results. So, the correct classification must be CoCoRes.
