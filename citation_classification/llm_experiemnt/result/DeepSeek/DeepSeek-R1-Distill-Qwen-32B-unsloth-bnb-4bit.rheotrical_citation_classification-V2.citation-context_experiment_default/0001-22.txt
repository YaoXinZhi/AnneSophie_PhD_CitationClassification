Okay, I need to classify the citation in the given scientific article passage. Let me look at the example provided under the 'Usage' class. The example is: "The experimental set-up was described in details previously (CITSEG)." The task is to determine the rhetorical class for (CITSEG). 

First, I read the passage. It says that the experimental setup was described in detail previously. This means the current study is referring to a prior work that provided the method or setup they used. 

Looking at the predefined classes, 'Usage' is when a citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup used in the current study. The example fits because the citation is pointing out that the setup was used before in another study, which means it's being used again here. 

I don't think it's 'Basis' because that would imply the cited work is the foundation of the new research, but here it's just the setup. It's not a comparison, so 'CoCoGM', 'CoCoRes', or 'CoCoXY' don't apply. It's not motivating or suggesting future work, so 'Motivation' or 'Future' aren't suitable. 'Neutral' doesn't fit because the citation is actively being used as a reference for the setup. 'Similar' and 'Support' aren't applicable here either. 

Therefore, the correct class is 'Usage' because the citation is referring to a method or setup used in the current study.
