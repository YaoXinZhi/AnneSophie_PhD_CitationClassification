Alright, I need to figure out which rhetorical class fits the citation in the given passage. Let's start by understanding the passage and the example provided.

The passage is about a study where (CITSEG) showed that a certain peptide interferes with virus uptake and binds to gut epithelia of different aphid species. The authors mention this to suggest broader applicability.

Looking at the examples, the "Future" class is used when citations point towards directions for future research. The example given in "Future" suggests something about broader applicability implying further research could explore that.

In this case, the citation is used to hint that the findings could apply beyond the specific context studied, thus pointing towards future research possibilities. Therefore, it fits the "Future" class.
