Okay, so I need to classify a scientific citation in a plant health article into one of these rhetorical classes. Let's start by understanding the passage and then figure out which class fits best.

Looking at the passage: "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not (CITSEG)."

First, I notice that the citation mentions supporting findings from another study. The authors are comparing their own results about insect hosts affecting bacterial communities with findings from fleas and ticks. 

Wait, no, actually, the passage says "supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria" and then cites (CITSEG). So, it's using the cited work as evidence that supports their own finding. That sounds like the Support class because they are citing another study that aligns with their results.

Alternatively, could it be CoCoRes? That's when comparing results. But here, it's more about supporting rather than comparing. The focus is on the cited work reinforcing their own findings, not directly contrasting or comparing the results side-by-side.

So, I think the correct class is Support because they're using the citation to confirm their results.
