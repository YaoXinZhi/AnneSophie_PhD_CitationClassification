Okay, so I need to classify the citation in this plant health passage. The task involves identifying the rhetorical class of the citation. Let me read the passage carefully.

The passage says: "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not (CITSEG)."

First, I notice that the authors mention their own finding about insect hosts affecting bacterial assembly. They then state that their finding is supported by recent cross-taxonic investigations, particularly citing (CITSEG). The cited work discusses how arthropod hosts govern bacterial assemblages in fleas and ticks, not influenced by rodent hosts or environmental conditions.

Now, looking at the rhetorical classes, I need to determine which one fits best. The classes include Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, Weakness.

The citation here is presented as confirmation of the authors' own finding. They say their finding is "supported" by recent investigations, directly referencing the cited work. This indicates that the cited paper is backing up or reinforcing their results.

So, the rhetorical class here would be "Support" because the citation is used to confirm or strengthen the authors' claims.
