Okay, I need to classify this citation reference into the appropriate rhetorical class. Let me read through the passage again. The passage says that the research is supported by another study which found the same pattern. The key word here is "supported." That suggests that the cited work is being used as evidence to back up the current findings. So, according to the classes, the 'Support' class is used when a citation reinforces the author's claims with evidence. Yeah, that makes sense. The citation isn't comparing methods or goals, it's just backing up their results. So the correct class here is Support.

Support
