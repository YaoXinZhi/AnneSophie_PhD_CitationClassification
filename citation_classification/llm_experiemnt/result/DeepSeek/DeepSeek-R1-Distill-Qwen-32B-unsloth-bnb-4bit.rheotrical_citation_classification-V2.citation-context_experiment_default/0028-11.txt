Okay, I need to determine the rhetorical class for the citation in the given passage. The passage is about identifying a knowledge gap in the mechanism of magnetic treatment influence. The cited work is referenced as showing that magnetic treatment prevents scale formation but didn't explain the mechanism. The current study aims to understand this mechanism, so the citation is used to justify why they are conducting this research. Therefore, the correct rhetorical class is "Motivation."

Motivation
