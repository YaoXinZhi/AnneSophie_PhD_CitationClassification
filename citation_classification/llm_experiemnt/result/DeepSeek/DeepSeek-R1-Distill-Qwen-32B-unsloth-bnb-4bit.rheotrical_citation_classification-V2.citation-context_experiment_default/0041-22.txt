Okay, I need to determine the rhetorical class for the citation in the given passage. Let me read the passage carefully: "Most closely related to this paper is concurrent work by (CITSEG) who propose a method to 'debias' word embeddings. Our work is complementary, as we focus instead on rigorously demonstrating human-like biases in word embeddings."

First, I notice that the passage is comparing the cited work with the current paper. The cited work is described as concurrent and their method is contrasted with the authors' focus on demonstrating human-like biases. The key terms here are "comparison" and "complementary," which indicate that the cited work's goals or methods are being contrasted with those in the current study.

Looking at the predefined classes, CoCoGM refers to a comparison of goals or methods. The passage explicitly contrasts the research goals: one focuses on debiasing, while the current paper focuses on demonstrating biases. This fits the definition of CoCoGM because it's comparing the cited work's methods and goals with the current paper's approach.

Other classes might be considered, but they don't fit as well. For example, Support would be if the citation was used to back up a claim, but here it's a comparison rather than support. Similarly, Motivation is about justifying why the research is being done, which isn't the case here. Basis involves foundational work, but the passage is about comparison, not foundation.

Therefore, the correct class is CoCoGM.
