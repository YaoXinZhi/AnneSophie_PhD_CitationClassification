Alright, let's tackle this classification step by step. The task is to determine the rhetorical class for the citation (CITSEG) within the given passage. 

First, I'll read through the passage to understand the context. The author is discussing their previous research on magnetic treatment preventing calcite scales in hard water and mentions that the mechanism isn't explained. They state that the purpose of the current work is to understand this mechanism. 

Looking at the passage: "Our previous research (CITSEG) has shown that the formation of the hard calcite scale on the surfaces exposed to hard water can be successfully prevented with the applied magnetic field. The explanation of the phenomena is not yet offered and the purpose of this work is to try to understand the mechanism of the beneficial influence of the magnetic treatment."

I notice that the citation is referring to prior work that established a phenomenon without explaining it. The current paper's motivation is to address the gap identified in this prior work. 

Now, considering the predefined classes:

- **Basis**: The cited work provides the foundation but doesn't directly state a knowledge gap.
- **Motivation**: This class fits when the citation identifies a knowledge gap or open question, which justifies the current research. The passage clearly states that the explanation is missing, hence the purpose of the current study.

Thus, the appropriate class is **Motivation**.

The citation is used to justify the current research by identifying a knowledge gap, which fits the "Motivation" class.
