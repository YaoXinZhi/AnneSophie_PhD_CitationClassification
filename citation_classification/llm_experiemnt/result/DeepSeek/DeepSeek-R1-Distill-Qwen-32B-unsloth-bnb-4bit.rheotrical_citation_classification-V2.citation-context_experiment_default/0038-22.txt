Okay, I need to classify the role of the citation in the given passage. The passage says, "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not (CITSEG)." 

Looking at the options, the citation is supporting the authors' own finding. The sentence explicitly says "is supported by" the cited work, so it's providing backing for their results. That fits the Support class.
