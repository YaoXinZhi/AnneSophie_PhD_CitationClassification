Okay, so I'm trying to classify this citation into one of the provided rhetorical classes. Let's break it down step by step.

The passage says: "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not (CITSEG)."

First, I need to identify the function of the citation here. The sentence starts by stating a finding by the authors and then mentions that this finding is supported by recent investigations. The authors are pointing out that their results align with the cited work. 

Looking at the list of rhetorical classes, I see "Support" is when the citation is used to back up the authors' own findings or arguments. The example given for Support is: "All subscales were consistent with previous research, particularly that of (CITSEG) also using a U.S. sample; as before, participants did not distinguish between personal interests and values as reasons for disputes, nor between competence and methods." This seems to fit the passage because the authors are using the citation to show that their results are consistent with prior research.

Alternatively, I might consider "Similar" since the authors mention that their findings are supported by similar investigations. However, "Support" seems more precise here because the citation is directly reinforcing their findings, rather than just pointing out a similarity.

Another possible class could be "Basis," but that's more about foundational work that the current study builds upon, which doesn't seem to be the case here. The citation is more about supporting their results rather than forming the basis of their research.

So, the most appropriate class is "Support" because the citation is being used to strengthen the authors' findings with supporting evidence.
