Alright, I'm trying to figure out the correct rhetorical class for the cited work in the given passage. Let me read the passage carefully.

The passage says, "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not (CITSEG)." 

So, the main point here is that the study's finding is supported by another investigation. The cited work's results align with the current study's findings. In the example for the 'Support' class, it mentions that the cited work is presented as evidence that strengthens the authorsâ€™ own findings or arguments. 

Looking at the passage, it's clear that the citation is being used to back up their claim by referencing another study that found similar results. They mention how the arthropod host influenced bacterial assemblages, similar to their own findings. 

I don't think it's 'CoCoRes' because the comparison here isn't directly contrasting results but rather showing alignment. It's more about supporting than comparing. Also, it's not 'Basis' because it's not foundational but rather corroborating. 

So, the most appropriate class is 'Support' because it's citing previous work to strengthen their own conclusions.
