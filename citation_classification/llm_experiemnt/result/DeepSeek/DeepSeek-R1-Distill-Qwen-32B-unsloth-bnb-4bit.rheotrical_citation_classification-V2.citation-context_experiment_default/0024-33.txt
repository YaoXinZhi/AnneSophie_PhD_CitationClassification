Okay, I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in the passage. Let me read the example again. The passage says: "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not (CITSEG)." 

Hmm, the key here is that the cited work supports the current finding. The authors are saying their result aligns with previous research, so CITSEG is used to support their claim. That would make the class "Support." It's not comparing or contrasting; it's just backing up their point with prior evidence. Also, it's not a neutral mention or discussing future work, so "Support" seems right.
</think>

The citation is used to support the authors' finding by referencing similar results from another study, indicating agreement or confirmation.
