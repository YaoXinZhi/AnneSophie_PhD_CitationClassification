Alright, I'm trying to figure out the correct rhetorical class for this citation in the passage. The sentence is: "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not (CITSEG)." 

First, I need to understand the structure of the sentence. The main point is about their finding regarding insect hosts affecting bacterial communities. They then mention that this finding is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations. The citation (CITSEG) is referring to a study on fleas and ticks, which found that arthropod hosts govern bacterial assemblages, unlike rodent hosts and environmental conditions. 

So, the purpose of citing this work is to provide additional evidence that supports their own finding. The cited work's results align with their own, reinforcing their conclusion. Therefore, the rhetorical class should reflect support.

I can rule out other classes. It's not a comparison since they're not discussing differences or contrasting methods. It's not used for motivation or identifying a knowledge gap. It's not pointing out weaknesses or a neutral mention. It's definitely supporting their statement with another study's findings.
