Okay, I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for this citation. The sentence says, "Our findings suggest that these results are similar to previous work done by CITSEG." So the author is pointing out that their current results are the same as what's been found before. 

Looking at the classes, I see "Similar" is when a citation points out a similarity, maybe in results or patterns. That seems like it could be the right one. Another class is "Support," used when the citation supports or confirms the current findings. But in this case, it's more about pointing out similarity rather than confirmation. 

Wait, the example for "Similar" is when the work of others is mentioned as being comparable, which fits here. The author isn't necessarily using CITSEG's work as evidence but just noting the similarity. So probably "Similar" is the correct class.

Alternatively, maybe "Support" if the similarity is used to back up the findings. But the phrasing here just says the results are similar, not that CITSEG's work supports their own. So I think "Similar" makes more sense here.

The citation points out a similarity between the current findings and previous work done by CITSEG.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The sentence mentions that "findings suggest that these results are similar to previous work done by CITSEG."
2. The key word here is "similar," indicating a comparison of results.
3. The class "Similar" is used when the citation points out a similarity between the cited work and the citing paper's results or observations.
4. This directly aligns with the example provided for the "Similar" class.

Result: "Similar"

JSON output:
{"label": "Similar"}
