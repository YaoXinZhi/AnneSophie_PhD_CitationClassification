Alright, so I have this passage that I need to classify a citation. The passage is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)." 

First, I need to determine the rhetorical class for (CITSEG). Looking at the predefined classes, I should go through each one to see which fits best.

The passage is comparing the results of the current work with those of the cited work. Specifically, it says that the results "substantially differ." This directly involves comparing the findings of both studies. 

Looking at the classes, CoCoRes (Comparison of Results) seems appropriate because it's used when comparing the results or findings. Another class, CoCoGM, deals with comparing goals or methods, but here it's about the results differing. 

So, the citation is being used to contrast the results, which fits CoCoRes. The other classes like Support, Usage, or Weakness don't apply here because it's not supporting a claim, using a method, or pointing out a weakness. It's a direct comparison of outcomes.

I think I'm confident that CoCoRes is the right class for this citation.
