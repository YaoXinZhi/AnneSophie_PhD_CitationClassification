Alright, let's see. I need to classify the citation in the passage provided into one of the specified rhetorical classes. The task is to figure out what role the cited work plays in the citing text. 

First, I'll read through the passage again to understand the context. The passage says: "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not (CITSEG)."

So, the authors are discussing their findings and mention that their results are supported by another study. The key word here is "supported by," which suggests that the cited work is backing up their claims or findings.

Looking at the classes, "Support" is when the citation is used to back up a claim or result. The example they gave was: "All subscales were consistent with previous research, particularly that of (CITSEG); as before, participants did not distinguish between personal interests and values..." So, similar structure here.

Other possible classes might be "Similar," but in this case, it's more about supporting rather than showing similarity. "CoCoRes" is about comparing results, but here it's more of a supporting without comparison.

Therefore, the most appropriate class is "Support."
