Okay, so I need to determine the rhetorical class for the citation in the given plant health domain passage. Let me read the passage again: 

"Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not (CITSEG)." 

Hmm, the authors are talking about their findings regarding insect hosts affecting bacterial communities. They mention that their finding is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations. The citation is in the context of supporting their own results, pointing to another study that found similar patterns in fleas and ticks. 

Looking at the rhetorical classes, "Support" is when the citation is used to reinforce a claim or finding. The authors are using the cited work as evidence that their own results are correct. 

I don't think it's "CoCoRes" because they are not directly comparing results from their study with the cited one; rather, they're aligning their findings with the cited work's findings. It's more about supporting their own conclusion. 

So, the correct class must be "Support."
</think>

The citation is used to support the authors' findings by referencing another study that aligns with their results.
