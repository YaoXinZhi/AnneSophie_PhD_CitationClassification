Alright, I need to classify the citation in the provided passage. The passage is talking about a study where the authors used a magnetic field to prevent scale formation in hard water and that this mechanism isn't yet understood. They're doing this study to figure out why the magnetic treatment works.

Looking at the classes, "Motivation" is when the citation justifies why the current research is being done, like identifying a knowledge gap. The example given for Motivation fits exactly because the citation points out that there's no explanation yet, motivating their current work.

So, since the citation is used to explain why they're conducting their research, it should be classified under "Motivation."
