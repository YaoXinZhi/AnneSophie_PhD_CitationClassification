Okay, I need to figure out the correct rhetorical class for the citation in the given passage. Let's see the passage again: 

"Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not (CITSEG)."

The citation is talking about recent cross-taxon investigations supporting their own finding. The context is that their finding is "supported" by another study. So, the cited work is being used as evidence to back up their own claim. 

Looking at the classes, "Support" is used when the citation is used to confirm or reinforce the authors' findings. This aligns because the cited work's results are matching the current study's findings. 

Other classes like "CoCoRes" might involve comparing results, but here it's more about agreement and support rather than a contrast or comparison. "Similar" could be a consideration because they mention cross-taxon investigations, but the key word here is "supported," which points more towards the "Support" class.

So, I think the appropriate class is "Support."
