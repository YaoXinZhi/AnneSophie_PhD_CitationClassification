Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to classify this citation. The user provided a passage where the citation is used, and I need to assign the correct rhetorical class from the given list. Let me read through the example again to understand the context.

The passage says: "However, a review of the available literature is rather confusing due to the often contradictory results that were reported. [REF1-REF12]". The citation here is referring to a range of references, and the context is about conflicting results in the literature. 

Looking at the rhetorical classes, I need to determine which one fits best. The example falls under CoCoRes, but wait, no, the user provided a different example. The actual example they gave for CoCoRes is a comparison of results between the cited work and the current paper. But in this case, the citation is pointing out that there are contradictory results from various studies, not necessarily comparing to the current work's results. 

Wait, no, the user's own example provided under CoCoRes is about conflicting results, but actually, in the example they gave for CoCoRes, they had a situation where the results differ from another study. However, in the passage provided, it's a review of the literature showing contradictory results without directly comparing to the current work's findings.

Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the classes. Let me review the definitions again. CoCoRes is when comparing or contrasting results with the current paper. CoCoXY is when comparing two cited studies with each other, not with the current paper.

In the given passage, the author is stating that the literature review shows contradictory results, which is a comparison among multiple cited studies. So it's CoCoXY because they're contrasting the cited works with each other, not with their own results.

Alternatively, it could be CoCoRes if they were comparing their results with others, but here they're just noting the conflicting results in the literature without directly tying it to their own findings. So, the correct class would be CoCoXY.

Wait, but in the example the user gave for CoCoXY, the citation is used to compare cited studies with each other. So yes, in the passage, the situation is that the literature has contradictory results, which is a comparison among cited works. Therefore, CoCoXY is the right class here.
