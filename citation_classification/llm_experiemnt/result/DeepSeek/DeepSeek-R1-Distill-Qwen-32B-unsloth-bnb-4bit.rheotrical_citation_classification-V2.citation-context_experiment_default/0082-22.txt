Okay, I need to classify the citation in the given paragraph into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. Let me read through the passage carefully.

The passage says: "The experimental set-up was described in details previously (CITSEG)." 

I know that the task is to find which rhetorical class this falls into. Looking at the options, there's a class called "Usage." The description for Usage is when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup that is directly used in the current study. 

In this case, the citation is referring to a previous detailed description of the experimental setup. Since the current study is using that same setup, it fits the "Usage" category because they're referencing a method/tool they've used.
