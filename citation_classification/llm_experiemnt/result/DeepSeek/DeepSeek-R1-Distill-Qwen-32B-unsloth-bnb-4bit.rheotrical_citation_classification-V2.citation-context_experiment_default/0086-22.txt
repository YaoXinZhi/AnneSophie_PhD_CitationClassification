Okay, I need to classify the citation (CITSEG) in the given passage into one of the specified rhetorical classes. Let me look at the passage again.

"...in the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 (CITSEG)."

This sentence is providing information about how magnetic water treatment devices have been spreading in the USA since 1975, citing a reference. The use of the citation here is purely to provide factual information without any further analysis or comparison. It's a neutral statement, just mentioning the trend without supporting or contrasting it with any other study or argument.

Looking at the classes, the Neutral class is for citations used in a neutral, descriptive way without supporting, comparing, or motivating any specific argument. This fits because the citation is simply stating a fact without any additional role in the argument.

So, the correct class for this citation is Neutral.
