Alright, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in this passage. Let me start by reading the example given.

The passage says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)."

Okay, breaking this down. The citing paper mentions that their results differ from those of the cited work. Theyâ€™re comparing their outcomes directly to the previous study. The key here is the comparison of results between their work and another study's findings.

Looking at the list of rhetorical classes, CoCoRes is defined as when the citation is used to compare or contrast the results or findings of the cited work with the citing paper. That fits because the passage explicitly states that their results differ from the cited work's results.

I don't think it's another class like Comparison of Goals or Methods because it's specifically talking about the outcomes, not the approach or objectives. It's not about support or motivation, as it's comparing results rather than confirming them or explaining why the research is needed.

So, the most appropriate class here is CoCoRes.
