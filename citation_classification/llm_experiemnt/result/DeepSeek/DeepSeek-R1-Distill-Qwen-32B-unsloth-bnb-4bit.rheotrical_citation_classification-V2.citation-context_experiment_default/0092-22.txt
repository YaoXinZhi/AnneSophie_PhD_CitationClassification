Okay, so I need to classify a citation in a scientific article passage into one of the given rhetorical classes. The passage provided is about using a method from a cited work to determine the number of viable spores in conidial suspensions. The example mentions that the method was used to count the spores, so the citation is referring to a method described elsewhere. 

Looking at the list of classes, "Usage" seems to fit because it's when the cited work is directly used in the current study, like a method, tool, or dataset. The example here clearly states that the method from the cited work was utilized for counting spores, which is a direct usage. 

So, the classification should be "Usage."

Usage

```json
{
  "class": "Usage"
}
