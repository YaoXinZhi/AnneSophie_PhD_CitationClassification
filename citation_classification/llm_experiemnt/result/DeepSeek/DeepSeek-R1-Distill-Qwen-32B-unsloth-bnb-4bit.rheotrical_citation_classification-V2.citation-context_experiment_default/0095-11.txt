Alright, let's try to figure out what rhetorical class the citation should fall into. So, the passage says, "(CITSEG) introduced and validated the IAT by studying biases..." and then the current research is replicating these results for the same purposes. Hmm, the key word here is "replicating." That means the current work is building upon what (CITSEG) did. They're using the previous work as a foundation. It seems like the cited work is the basis because the current study is continuing or extending that research.
