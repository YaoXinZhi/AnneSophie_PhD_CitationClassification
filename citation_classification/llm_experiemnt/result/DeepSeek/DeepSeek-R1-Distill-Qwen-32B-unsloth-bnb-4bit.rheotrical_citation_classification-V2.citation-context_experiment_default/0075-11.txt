Okay, so I need to classify the given citation (CITSEG) into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. Let me look at the passage again. It says, "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not (CITSEG)." 

Hmm, the citing sentence is stating their finding and then mentions that it's supported by other investigations. The citation is being used to back up their claim, so it's providing evidence that strengthens their own results. It's not comparing methods or goals, nor is it pointing out a similarity or a future direction. They're not using it to highlight a weakness either. It's purely about supporting their own findings with another study's results. So the correct class should be 'Support'.
</think>

The citation is used to support the author's findings by referencing another study's results, which aligns with their conclusion.
