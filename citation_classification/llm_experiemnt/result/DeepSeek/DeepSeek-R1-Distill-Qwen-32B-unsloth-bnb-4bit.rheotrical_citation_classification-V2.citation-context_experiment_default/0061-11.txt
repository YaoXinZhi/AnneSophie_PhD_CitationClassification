Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to classify this citation. The user provided a task where I need to assign each citation (denoted as CITSEG) to one of several rhetorical classes. The classes include things like Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, etc. 

So, looking at the example given: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)." 

In this sentence, the author is talking about their own results and contrasting them with the results from the cited work. They say their results are substantially different. That sounds like a comparison of results between their study and the cited one. 

The class CoCoRes is specifically for when citations are used to compare or contrast results. So this fits because the author is directly comparing their findings with those from the cited paper. Therefore, the correct class should be CoCoRes.
