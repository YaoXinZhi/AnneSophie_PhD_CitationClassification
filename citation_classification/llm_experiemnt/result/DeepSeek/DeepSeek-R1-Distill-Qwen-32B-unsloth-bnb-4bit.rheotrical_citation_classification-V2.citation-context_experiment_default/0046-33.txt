Okay, I need to classify the rhetorical function of a citation in a scientific article passage using the predefined classes. The user has provided a sample classification where the output label is 'Support', but the example given is about a study supporting the authors' findings.

Looking at the provided classes:

1. **Basis** - When the cited work is foundational to the current research.
2. **CoCoGM** - Comparing goals or methods.
3. **CoCoRes** - Comparing results.
4. **CoCoXY** - Comparing two studies.
5. **Future** - Suggesting future research directions.
6. **Motivation** - Justifying why the research is conducted.
7. **Neutral** - Neutral, descriptive use.
8. **Similar** - Pointing out similarities.
9. **Support** - Cited work supports the authors' claims.
10. **Usage** - Using a method or tool from the cited work.
11. **Weakness** - Criticizing the cited work.

The example given is about supporting the authors' findings because the cited work aligns with their results. So, the appropriate label is 'Support'.
</think>

The cited work is used to support the authors' findings by aligning with their results.
