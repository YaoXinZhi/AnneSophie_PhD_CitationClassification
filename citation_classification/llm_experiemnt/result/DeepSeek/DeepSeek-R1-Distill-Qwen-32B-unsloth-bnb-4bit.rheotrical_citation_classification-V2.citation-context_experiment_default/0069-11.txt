Alright, I need to classify the citation passage provided by the user into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. Let me start by understanding the task and the passage.

The task is to assign a class label to each citation (denoted as CITSEG) in a scientific text based on its rhetorical function. The classes include Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, and Weakness.

Looking at the example passage provided by the user:

"In the passage, the citation (CITSEG) is used to state that 'the experimental set-up was described in detail previously.' This seems to indicate that the cited work provided the methodology or setup that is being utilized in the current study."

In this context, the use of CITSEG is to refer to a previous description of an experimental setup. The current study is using this setup, which implies that the cited work provided a method, tool, or experimental setup that the authors are directly utilizing.

Now, referring to the list of classes, the 'Usage' class is defined as when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup from the cited work that is directly used in the current study. The example given for 'Usage' is: "The experimental set-up was described in details previously (CITSEG)."

In the given passage, the exact wording is: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously (CITSEG)." This matches the 'Usage' class exactly because the authors are referring to a methodological detail from the cited work that they are using in their current study.

I should consider if there's any possibility of it being another class, but in this case, the reference is clearly about the experimental setup, which is a methodological aspect. There's no comparison, support, or motivation involved here; it's a straightforward usage of a prior method.

Therefore, the most appropriate class for this citation is 'Usage'.
