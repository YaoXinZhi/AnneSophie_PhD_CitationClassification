Alright, so I need to classify each citation in the passage using the predefined rhetorical classes. The passage provided is about how researchers have identified and characterized various proteins contributing to plant-pathogen interactions. There are two citations, (CITSEG1) and (CITSEG2).

First, I'll look at (CITSEG1). The sentence mentions that proteins have been identified and characterized using molecular approaches. The example given for this citation is that it's neutral because it's just providing information without comparing or supporting. So, (CITSEG1) falls under the Neutral class.

Next, (CITSEG2) is cited to support a claim about the role of these proteins in host resistance or susceptibility. This means the citation is used as evidence to back up their findings, so it should be classified under Support.

The citations are analyzed and categorized based on their function within the passage.

```json
{
  "CITSEG1": "Neutral",
  "CITSEG2": "Support"
}
