Okay, I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for this citation. Let me break it down. The passage says that the authors used a method to analyze their data and reference (CITSEG). The context suggests that (CITSEG) provided a specific method or tool that they're using in their current study. They're not comparing their results with (CITSEG)'s, nor are they using it to support their claims or highlight weaknesses. It's more about the practical application of the method from (CITSEG) in their work. That makes me think it's the Usage class because they're referring to a method or tool used directly.
