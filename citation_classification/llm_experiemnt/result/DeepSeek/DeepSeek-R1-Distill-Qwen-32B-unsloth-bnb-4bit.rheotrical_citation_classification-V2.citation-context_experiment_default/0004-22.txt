Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the correct rhetorical class for the citation in this plant health passage. The passage says, "(CITSEG) reported a 90% increase in the incidence of the disease in the region." 

First, I need to understand the context. The citing paper is discussing the increase in a disease incidence. They reference a previous study (CITSEG) that found a 90% increase. My task is to determine how this citation is being used within the argument.

Looking at the predefined classes, I need to see which one fits best. 

- **Basis**: This would be if CITSEG is foundational to their research, but the passage seems to be citing a result, not laying the groundwork.
- **CoCoGM or CoCoRes**: These involve comparing goals/methods or results. Since the passage isn't comparing with their own work, but just stating someone else's findings, maybe not.
- **Future**: If it's about suggesting future research, but the passage is about a result, not future directions.
- **Motivation**: If it's justifying why the research is needed, but again, it's presenting a result, not a motivation.
- **Neutral**: If it's just a neutral mention. But here, they're using the citation to back up their own point about increased incidence.
- **Similar**: If it's pointing out a similarity, but it's more about supporting their own point.
- **Support**: The citation is used to reinforce their claim about increased incidence, so this might fit.
- **Usage**: If they're using a method, dataset, etc., but it's about a result, not a method.

Hmm, "support" seems likely because they're using CITSEG's findings to back up their discussion on disease incidence. But wait, is it more about just stating a result without supporting their own specific claim? Maybe "neutral" could apply since it's presenting a fact without necessarily supporting their argument directly. But the way it's phrased, they're highlighting someone else's result which likely supports their point indirectly.

On second thought, if they're discussing their own findings on disease incidence and citing a previous study that also found a high increase, it's more about supporting their own claim, even if not explicitly. So "Support" might be the best fit because it reinforces their statement about the disease's increase.
