Alright, I need to classify the citation in this plant health passage. Let me read through the example given and figure out what's happening.

The example passage is: "However, a review of the available literature is rather confusing due to the often contradictory results that were reported. [REF1-REF12]" The citation [REF1-REF12] refers to a range of studies that are conflicting.

Looking at the predefined classes, I need to see which one fits best. The class CoCoXY is for comparing two cited studies with each other, not with the current paper. In the example, the passage mentions contradictory results from studies, which are being compared against each other.

Wait, but the passage is from a scientific article. The authors are pointing out that multiple studies have conflicting findings, specifically referencing REF1-REF12. So, they're comparing these studies to highlight contradictions, which aligns with the CoCoXY class because they're comparing cited studies' claims or explanations.

I should also check other classes. For instance, Support is when the citation supports the current work, which isn't the case here. Weakness is about criticizing a cited work, but here it's the conflict between studies. Neutral doesn't fit because the use is more than just descriptiveâ€”it's pointing out contradictions. So, CoCoXY seems appropriate.
