Alright, so I need to classify the given citation passage into one of the rhetorical classes. Let me go through each class and see which one fits best.

The passage mentions that the cited work demonstrated a specific phenomenon in a model system. The current study then states that their findings align with this, showing a similar outcome in a different, related system. 

Looking at the classes:
- **Basis**: This is when the cited work is foundational. But here, the study uses it for comparison, not as a foundation.
- **CoCoGM**: Compares methods or goals. The passage doesn't discuss methods or goals, just results.
- **CoCoRes**: Direct comparison of results. They mention that their findings align, which is a form of comparison.
- **CoCoXY**: Comparing two cited studies. Here, it's one citation compared to the current study.
- **Future**: Suggesting future research. Not the case here.
- **Motivation**: Justifying why the research is done. They're not filling a gap but supporting their results.
- **Neutral**: Used neutrally without comparison. But they do compare results.
- **Similar**: Pointing out similarity in results. They do show their results align with the cited work.
- **Support**: Cited work supports their results, aligning with their findings.
- **Usage**: Mentioning a method or tool used. Not applicable here.
- **Weakness**: Criticizing the cited work. They don't point out flaws, just alignment.

Between **CoCoRes**, **Similar**, and **Support**: The passage shows that their findings are similar and align, so **Support** might fit because they use the cited work as evidence backing their results. Alternatively, **Similar** because it points out the alignment. However, the key is that they are using the citation to support their own findings, so **Support** might be more accurate.

But wait, in the example given for **Support**, it's about confirming previous findings, which is exactly what the passage does. So maybe **Support** is the right class here.
</think>

The citation is used to support the current study's findings by showing alignment with previous research.

**Step-by-step explanation:**

1. The passage indicates that the current study's results align with those of the cited work.
2. The purpose is to validate their findings using prior research.
3. This aligns with the "Support" class, where the citation reinforces the authors' claims.
