Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for this citation. The example given is (CITSEG) in the context of introducing a method used in the study. The sentence is: "The experimental set-up was described in details previously (CITSEG)." 

First, I'll look at the predefined classes to see which matches best. The classes are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, and Weakness.

The sentence mentions that the experiment's setup was described before. It seems like the study is referring to a method used elsewhere, which they are using in their current work. That makes me think about the "Usage" class. Usage is when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or setup used in the current study. That fits because the citing paper is using the previous setup.

I don't think any other class fits better here. It's not comparing methods (CoCoGM) because it's just pointing out that the setup was used before. It's not supporting a claim (Support) because it's not reinforcing a finding; it's just stating the method was used. It's also not criticizing (Weakness) or anything else like that.

So, the most appropriate class is "Usage."
