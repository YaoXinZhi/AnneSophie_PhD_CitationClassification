Okay, so I need to figure out what class label to assign to the citation (CITSEG) in the given passage. The task is to classify each citation into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. Let me read through the passage to understand the context.

The passage says, "Our previous research (CITSEG) has shown that the formation of the hard calcite scale on the surfaces exposed to hard water can be successfully prevented with the applied magnetic field." 

Hmm, looking at this, the citation is referring to the author's own earlier work. The sentence is explaining why this current research is being done. The previous work demonstrated that magnetic fields can prevent scale formation, but it didn't explain the mechanism. So the current work is motivated by filling that gap.

Now, I need to match this to the rhetorical classes. The 'Motivation' class is used when the citation justifies why the current research is being conducted, like identifying a knowledge gap or open question. 

The example given for Motivation is exactly like this: citing previous work that shows a result, but the current work aims to understand the mechanism behind it. So this fits the Motivation class because it's setting up the reason for conducting the new research.
