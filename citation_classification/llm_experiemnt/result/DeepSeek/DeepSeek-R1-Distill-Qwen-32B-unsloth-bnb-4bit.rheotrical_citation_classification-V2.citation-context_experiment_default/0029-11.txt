Alright, I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in the given passage. The task is to assign one of the predefined classes to the citation. Let's look at the passage and the example provided.

The passage says: "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not (CITSEG)."

So, the sentence starts by stating their finding and then mentions that it's supported by recent investigations of other bacteria. Then, they elaborate on how in fleas and ticks, the host governed the assemblages. The citation (CITSEG) comes right after giving a specific example of another study.

Looking at the classes, Support is when the citation is used to back up the authors' own claims. Here, the cited work is providing evidence that aligns with the authors' findingsâ€”that the host affects bacterial communities. It's presented as evidence supporting their claim, so the rhetorical class should be Support.
