Okay, so I need to classify the citation in the passage provided as per the given rhetorical classes. Let me read the passage again.

The citation is in this context: "Similarly, a small aphid gut binding peptide was shown to interfere with enamovirus uptake from pea aphid gut into the hemocoel; the peptide also bound to gut epithelia of two other aphid species suggesting potential broader applicability (CITSEG)."

Looking at this, the sentence mentions that a peptide's broad applicability is suggested. This implies that the cited work is pointing towards possible future research directions, maybe exploring how effective the peptide is across different species. 

I need to check the classes. The 'Future' class is when the citation is used to suggest directions for future research. The example they gave: "Similarly, ... suggesting potential broader applicability (CITSEG)." That's similar to our passage here, which suggests future exploration of the peptide's applicability.

So, the appropriate class here is 'Future'.
