Okay, so I need to figure out how to classify the citation in the given passage. Let me go through the steps one by one.

First, I should extract the context around the citation @@CITATION@@. It says, "We compared our results with previous studies on apple scab resistance and found significant differences in the genetic markers identified @@CITATION@@."

Looking at this, the context is about comparing their current findings with previous studies. They mention "significant differences in the genetic markers identified," which suggests they're contrasting their results with those of the cited work.

Next, identifying the general intent. Since they're comparing their results to another study, it falls under the Comparative category. Specifically, it's about comparing results, which points towards CoCoRes or CoCoXY.

Now, for the specific rhetorical classes. The citation is used to compare their results with another study, so CoCoRes seems the most appropriate because it's about comparing results. Additionally, since they're referencing another study to contrast their findings, there might be a Neutral aspect because they're simply stating the difference without necessarily supporting or criticizing the previous work. Lastly, it's somewhat Descriptive in nature as they're presenting their findings in relation to others, but maybe that's less so.

So, the top classes are CoCoRes (1), Neutral (2), and maybe Similar or Support, but since it's a direct comparison of results, CoCoRes is first. Neutral follows as they're just stating the difference. Then perhaps Basis if the cited study is foundational, but in this case, it's more about comparison. 

Wait, reconsidering: the citation is used to show differences, so it's definitely CoCoRes. Neutral might not fit perfectly because it's not just a neutral mention but a comparison. Maybe the third could be CoCoXY if it's comparing two studies, but in this case, the cited work is being compared directly to the current study, not two studies to each other.

Alternatively, maybe Usage isn't applicable here. No, the citation is about comparing, not using the method. So, the top three would be CoCoRes (1), Neutral (2), and perhaps CoCoGM if it's about methods, but it's about results, so CoCoRes is first, then maybe CoCoXY, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the example given for CoCoRes is about different results compared, so yes, CoCoRes is first. Then since they're not directly supporting or criticising, it's neutral. The third might be the context of the cited work being foundational, but since they didn't mention that, Basis might be less. Or maybe Similar if they find similar results, but in this case, it's different.

So, the ranking should be:

1. CoCoRes
2. Neutral
3. Basis (though less so, but the cited study is foundational)

1. CoCoRes  
2. Neutral  
3. Basis
