Okay, I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ from the given passage into the top three rhetorical classes. First, I'll extract the context around the citation to understand its intent. The passage says, "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@@." 

The context shows that the citation is supporting the authors' finding that hosts influence bacterial communities. The authors mention their finding and then cite another study that supports this. So the general intent is supportive. 

Looking at the possible classes, the primary one is Support because the citation directly confirms their result. Next, since it's pointing out a similarity in findings, Similar is the second. The third might be Neutral since the citation is just mentioned without further analysis.

So the top three classes are Support, Similar, and Neutral.

1. Support  
2. Similar  
3. Neutral
