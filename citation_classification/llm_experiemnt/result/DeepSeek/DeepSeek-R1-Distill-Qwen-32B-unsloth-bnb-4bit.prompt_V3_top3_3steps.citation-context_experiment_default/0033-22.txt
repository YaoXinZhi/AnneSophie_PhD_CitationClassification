Okay, so I need to figure out the top three rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in this passage. Let's start by understanding the context. The passage mentions that researchers observed the spread of the plant pathogen in areas with high precipitation levels. They reference a specific study which examined how environmental conditions, including precipitation, affect the transmission of plant pathogens.

First, I'll extract the context around @@CITATION@@. It seems the main point is about how precipitation influences disease transmission. The citation supports their observation by pointing out that another study found similar results regarding environmental conditions and disease spread.

Looking at the general intent, this is a supportive statement because they're using the cited work to back up their findings. So, the primary rhetorical class is Support.

Next, the citation also shows that their results are similar to previous findings, which might fall under Similar. However, the primary focus is on support rather than just similarity.

Lastly, if there's a mention of future research directions or if it's used descriptively without much analysis, those could be lower on the list. But here, the main focus is on support, so the third might be either Future or Neutral, but probably not as strong as the first two.

Putting it all together, the top class is Support, second is Similar, and third could be Neutral since it's not a direct comparison or a method usage.

1. Support  
2. Similar  
3. Neutral
