Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by understanding what the passage is discussing.

The passage talks about the effectiveness of pheromone-based methods for managing pest insects. It mentions that these methods are efficient and environmentally friendly, relying on the production of female sex pheromones. 

Looking closer, the sentence with the citation says, "In contrast, the use of pheromones and their analogs for monitoring and controlling pest insects has been proven to be efficient and environment-friendly, relying on the production of female sex pheromones by the species @@CITATION@@." 

So the citation is supporting the assertion that pheromone-based methods are efficient and environment-friendly. The author is using it to back up their claim. That makes me think the general intent is Supportive.

Now, considering the predefined classes, Support is the most appropriate because it's directly confirming the claim made in the citing paper. There's no comparison or contrast here, so CoCo classes like CoCoRes or CoCoGM don't fit. It's not about the methodology or motivation but rather affirming the effectiveness through the cited source. Also, it's not a neutral mention or a technical usage.

So the top three classes would be Support as the primary, then maybe Similar or Neutral if needed, but since it's a support, the others aren't as relevant.

1. Support  
2. Neutral  
3. Similar
