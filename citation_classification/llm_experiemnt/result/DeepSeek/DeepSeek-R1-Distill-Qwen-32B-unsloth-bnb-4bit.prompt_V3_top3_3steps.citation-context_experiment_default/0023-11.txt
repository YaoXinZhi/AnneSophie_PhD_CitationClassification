Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. The passage says, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." 

Step 1 is to extract the context around @@CITATION@@. The context is about comparing current results with a previous study's results using specific metallic targets.

Step 2, identifying the general intent. Since the citation is comparing results, the intent is Comparative.

Now, looking at the classes, the main options are CoCoRes, which is for comparing results, and possibly CoCoXY if the comparison is between other studies. But here, the comparison is between the current work and the cited study, not two cited studies. So CoCoRes is appropriate.

Other possible classes: Since it's a direct comparison of results, Basis isn't the intent here. Motivation, Future, Usage aren't applicable. It's not a weakness or supporting.

So, the top class is CoCoRes. Maybe CoCoXY could be a stretch if considering comparing two cited works, but in the example, it's one work compared to the current. Neutral isn't right because it's making a comparison, which is not neutral. 

So, other possible might be Neutral, but it's about comparison, so it's more specific. Maybe Similar, but the example given for Similar talks about supporting findings, whereas here it's contrasting.

So, top three: 1. CoCoRes, 2. Support (if supporting that the results differ, though it's more about comparison), 3. Neutral.

1. CoCoRes  
2. Support  
3. Neutral
