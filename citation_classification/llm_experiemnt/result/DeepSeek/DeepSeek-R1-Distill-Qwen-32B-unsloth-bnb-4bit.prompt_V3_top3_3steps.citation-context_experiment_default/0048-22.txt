Okay, so I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. Let me start by understanding the task thoroughly.

First, according to the instructions, I have to extract the context surrounding the citation. I should keep only the parts that are relevant to understanding why the citation is being used. The context provided is: "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@." 

Looking at this sentence, it seems to be a factual statement about the spread of magnetic water treatment devices in the USA starting from 1975, with the citation supporting this statement. There's no indication of comparison, motivation, criticism, or any other specific intent beyond stating a fact.

Next, I need to identify the general intent. The passage isn't foundational, motivational, or technical. It's simply providing information. The citation is used to back up this statement, so it's likely a supportive or neutral context.

Now, mapping to the predefined classes: Support is used when the citation confirms the citing authors' work, while Neutral is when the citation is used descriptively without any particular argument. Here, the citation is just providing a reference for the spread of these devices without necessarily corroborating specific findings or methods used by the authors. It's more of a factual citation without a clear supportive intent beyond describing the situation.

Therefore, the top three classes would be Neutral as the primary, as it's a descriptive use, then Support, and possibly Usage if it's referring to the method, but since it's more about the spread rather than usage, Neutral is more fitting.

1. Neutral  
2. Support  
3. Usage
