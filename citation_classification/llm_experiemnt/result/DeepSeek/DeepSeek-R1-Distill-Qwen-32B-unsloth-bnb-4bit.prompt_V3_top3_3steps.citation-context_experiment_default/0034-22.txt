Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical classes for this citation. Let me start by looking at the context around the citation @@CITATION@@. 

The passage mentions that "Our finding... is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations..." This suggests that the authors are using the cited work to back up their own results. 

Now, looking at the predefined classes, Support is when a citation is used to confirm the current work's findings. Since the authors explicitly say "supports" their findings, Support seems like the primary class. 

Next, the passage also states that other studies "of other insect-associated bacteria" were used, which shows a similarity in results. So, Similar might be the second class because it's pointing out that other research aligns with their findings. 

Lastly, while the support is the main focus, there's a descriptive element mentioned, so Neutral could be a third option because parts of the citation are just providing context without necessarily supporting or comparing. 

So, the top three classes are Support, Similar, and Neutral.

1. Support  
2. Similar  
3. Neutral
