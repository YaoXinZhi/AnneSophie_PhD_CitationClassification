Alright, I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific passage. First, I'll extract the context around the citation to understand its intent.

The passage says, "Several studies have shown that soil health improves when organic amendments are applied, as they increase microbial activity and promote plant growth @@CITATION@@."

Looking at this, the citation is supporting the claim that organic amendments improve soil health by increasing microbial activity and promoting plant growth. So, it's used to back up the author's point.

Next, I'll identify the general intent. The citation supports the current argument, so it's supportive.

Now, considering the predefined classes, the most appropriate is Support. Since the citation only confirms the point, CoCoRes and Neutral are less likely as there's no comparison or neutral mention. So the top three are Support, then CoCoRes and Neutral.

1. Support  
2. CoCoRes  
3. Neutral
