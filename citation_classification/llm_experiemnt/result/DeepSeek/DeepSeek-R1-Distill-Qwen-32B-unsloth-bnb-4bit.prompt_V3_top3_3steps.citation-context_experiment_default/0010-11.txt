Okay, let me try to figure this out step by step. First, I need to understand the context around the citation @@CITATION@@ in the passage. The context provided is: "The taxonomic status of these species is problematic and some may not develop on Pyrus @@CITATION@@."

So, the main point here is that the authors are pointing out that the taxonomic status of certain species is problematic. They mention that some species might not develop on Pyrus, referencing the cited work.

Now, looking at the definitions of the rhetorical classes:

1. **Weakness**: This is when the citation is used to criticize or point out limitations in the cited work. The passage here is clearly indicating that the taxonomic status is problematic, which suggests that the cited work may have some issues or limitations in its findings.

2. **Neutral**: This is used when the citation is just mentioned in a factual or descriptive manner without any supporting or critical tone. In this case, the context is not neutral because the authors are pointing out an issue with the cited work.

3. Other classes like Basis, CoCoGM, etc., don't fit here because the focus is on the problem with the cited work, not on foundational information, comparisons, motivation, support, etc.

So, the top three rhetorical classes would be:

1. Weakness  
2. Neutral  
3. Support
