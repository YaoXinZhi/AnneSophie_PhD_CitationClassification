Okay, I need to determine the top three rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by understanding the context provided.

The passage discusses the classification of citations in plant health articles. The classifier's job is to assign the citation to the most appropriate rhetorical classes. The predefined list of classes includes Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Motivation, Future, Support, Similar, Usage, Weakness, and Neutral.

First, I should extract the context around @@CITATION@@. The passage explains the task of the classifier, which is to identify the intent behind the citation. It provides different examples for each rhetorical class. The example given for each class helps me understand how they are used.

Looking at the example for Basis: "introduced and validated the IAT by studying biases." Here, the citation provides foundational work for the current research. So if @@CITATION@@ is used to establish a foundation, that's Basis.

CoCoGM is when citations are compared in terms of goals or methods. The example mentions comparing methods between studies, so if the citation is used to contrast methods or goals, that's CoCoGM.

CoCoRes compares results. If @@CITATION@@ is used to compare findings with another study, thatâ€™s CoCoRes. 

CoCoXY compares explanations or claims between two studies, not necessarily with the current paper. So if the citation is used to compare two earlier studies, that would be CoCoXY.

Motivation is when the citation is used to justify why the research is being done. The example points out a knowledge gap, so if @@CITATION@@ is used to highlight a need or gap, that's Motivation.

Future suggests directions for further research. If @@CITATION@@ hints at next steps, that's Future.

Support uses the citation to back up the current work. The example mentions consistent results, so if the citation is supporting the current findings, Support is appropriate.

Similar highlights similarities between the cited work and the current paper. If @@CITATION@@ shows similar results or patterns, Similar applies.

Usage refers to using a method, tool, or dataset. The example describes using an experimental setup, so if @@CITATION@@ is about using something from another study, that's Usage.

Weakness points out flaws or limitations in the cited work. If @@CITATION@@ is criticized, Weakness is the class.

Neutral is when the citation is mentioned without any specific argumentative role. The example is a straightforward mention without supporting or critiquing.

Now, considering the task, the goal is to assign three classes based on how @@CITATION@@ is used in the passage. But since the task was to outline the process, I think the actual application would involve looking at the specific context where @@CITATION@@ appears.

But since I don't have the exact passage here, I'll assume a scenario. Let's imagine @@CITATION@@ is used to compare different methods in the cited studies. That would primarily fall under CoCoGM. If it's also discussing results, CoCoRes could be second. If there's a mention of future research directions, Future would be third.

Alternatively, if @@CITATION@@ supports the current findings, Support would be first, Similar second if there are similar patterns, and Neutral third if the mention is descriptive.

In the absence of the exact context, I'll proceed with a generic reasoning.

1. CoCoGM  
2. CoCoRes  
3. Future
