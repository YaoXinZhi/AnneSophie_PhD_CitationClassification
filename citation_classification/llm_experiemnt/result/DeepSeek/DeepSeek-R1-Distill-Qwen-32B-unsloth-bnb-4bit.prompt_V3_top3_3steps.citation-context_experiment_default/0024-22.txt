Okay, I need to determine the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let's start by extracting the relevant context around the citation.

Looking at the sentence: "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@@."

The citation is introducing a comparison between the current findings and other studies. Specifically, the paper is supporting its results by referencing similar findings in other insects. This suggests that the citation is used to confirm or support their results.

Next, identify the general intent. The example shows that the citation is supporting the current work with similar results. So the general intent is supportive.

From the predefined classes, the most appropriate is Support. Another possible class is Similar because it points out that other studies have shown the same effect in different organisms. Additionally, if the passage is pointing out a specific method or tool used, it might be Usage, but in this case, it's more about the findings rather than the method.

So, the top three classes would be Support, Similar, and perhaps Usage if the cited work's method is being referenced, but based on the passage, it's more about the findings. So after Support and Similar, a neutral class might not fit as it's clearly being used to support their work.

Alternatively, maybe the citation is being used to compare results, which would make it CoCoRes if the cited work's results are compared, but in the example, it's more about supporting rather than comparing. 

Wait, the example given for Support is exactly this situation: the paper supports their findings by citing similar results. Therefore, Support is first. Then, Similar could be second because it's pointing out a resemblance. Usage might not apply here since the citation isn't about methods but results, so perhaps Neutral is not the best fit. Alternatively, if there's a comparison in explanations, but that's more about methods or claims.

I think the top three would be:

1. Support
2. Similar
3. CoCoRes (if comparing results)
</think>

1. Support  
2. Similar  
3. CoCoRes
