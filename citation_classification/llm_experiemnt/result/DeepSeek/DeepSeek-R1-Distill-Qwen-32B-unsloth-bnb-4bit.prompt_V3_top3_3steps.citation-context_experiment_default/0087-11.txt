Alright, I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ from the given passage into three rhetorical classes. First, I'll extract the context surrounding the citation. The passage discusses the influence of magnetic treatment on preventing hard calcite scale formation on surfaces exposed to hard water. The authors mention that their previous research (cited) showed the prevention and now aim to understand the mechanism better.

Next, I'll identify the general intent. It looks like the citation is explaining why they're conducting this study, pointing out that the mechanism isn't yet understood. This aligns with the Motivational category, specifically Motivation.

For the specific classes, the citation justifies the current research by highlighting a knowledge gap, so Motivation is the primary class. There's no direct comparison, so CoCo classes aren't suitable. They're using past results to support their current study's rationale, so Support could be second. No mention of future work, so Future isn't relevant. Basis might be a stretch if the cited work is foundational, but it's more about motivating the current study.

So, ranking them:
1. Motivation
2. Support
3. Basis

1. Motivation  
2. Support  
3. Basis
