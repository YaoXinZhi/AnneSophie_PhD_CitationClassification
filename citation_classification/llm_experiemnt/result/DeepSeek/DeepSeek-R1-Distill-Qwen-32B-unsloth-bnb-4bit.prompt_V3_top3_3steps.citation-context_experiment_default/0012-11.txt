Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific passage. Let's start by carefully reading the passage and identifying the context where the citation is mentioned. 

The passage says: "In this study, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify loci associated with drought tolerance in rice. Our findings are similar to those reported by @@CITATION@@, who found several candidate genes linked to drought stress responses in wheat."

First, I'll note that the citation is referring to another study where similar candidate genes were found in wheat under drought stress. This suggests a comparison between the two studies in terms of results, as both identified genes linked to drought tolerance, just in different crops.

Now, I'll go through the steps. Step 1 is to extract the context. The context here is that the current study's findings are similar to another study in wheat regarding drought-related genes.

Step 2 is to identify the general intent. Since the current study's findings are being compared to another's, it's a comparative intent. Specifically, the focus is on the results or findings, not the methods or goals.

Step 3 is to assign the top three specific rhetorical classes. From the list, CoCoRes (Comparison of Results) seems most appropriate because the citation is comparing the results. Similar is also applicable because it's highlighting the similarity in findings. Support could be considered as well, since it's backing up the current study's results with another's findings.

So, ranking these, CoCoRes is first since it directly addresses the comparison of results. Second would be Similar because that's the explicit statement. Third, Support because it's providing backing through similarity.

1. CoCoRes  
2. Similar  
3. Support
