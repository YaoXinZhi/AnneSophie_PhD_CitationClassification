Okay, I need to assign three rhetorical classes to the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific passage. Let me start by extracting the context.

The context provided mentions that @@CITATION@@ "introduced and validated the IAT by studying biases that they consider nearly universal in humans and about which there is no social concern." The authors then say they began by replicating these inoffensive results for the same purposes. 

So, the general intent here is foundational because they're referencing earlier work that forms the basis of their current research. The authors are building upon the cited work by replicating their results.

Looking at the definitions, the most appropriate class is Basis since it's establishing the intellectual foundation. Next, the replication implies a comparison of results, so CoCoRes could be a secondary class. However, since the focus is on replicating rather than contrasting, the primary is Basis and the others might not fit as well. But they also mention using the same purposes, which could indicate a Similar result. Alternatively, they could be supporting their approach, so Support might also be considered. 

After evaluating, Basis is definitely the top. Then, because they are replicating the same results, Similar makes sense as a secondary. Third, it could also be Support because they're confirming the results. But I'm not entirely sure if Support is better than Similar here. Since they're replicating for the same purposes, Similar seems appropriate as it's pointing out that their results align with the cited work.

1. Basis  
2. Similar  
3. Support
