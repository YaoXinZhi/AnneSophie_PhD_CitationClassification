Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I need to extract the context around @@CITATION@@. The passage mentions that the citation shows the presence of a particular pathogen species in the host. It's part of a discussion highlighting new records and supporting observations.

Next, identifying the general intent. The citation is used to support the findings that the new records are valid. This suggests a supportive intent, as it's confirming the research's results.

Now, assigning the top three rhetorical classes. The primary class is Support because it's directly backing the study's conclusions. Similar could be next since the citation points to similar findings. Neutral follows because, without more context, it's a factual statement. So, Support is first, Similar second, Neutral third.

1. Support  
2. Similar  
3. Neutral
