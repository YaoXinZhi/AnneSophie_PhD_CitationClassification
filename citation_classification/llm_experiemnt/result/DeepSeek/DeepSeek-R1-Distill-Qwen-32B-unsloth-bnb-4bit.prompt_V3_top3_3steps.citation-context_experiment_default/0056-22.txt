Okay, I need to figure out the top three rhetorical classes for the citation marked @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let's start by understanding the problem.

First, the task is to classify the citation based on how it's used in the context of the passage. The predefined classes are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Motivation, Future, Support, Similar, Usage, Weakness, and Neutral.

Looking at the passage, the user hasn't provided any specific context or the citation itself. So, I'm a bit stuck because without the actual text, it's hard to assess the intent. 

However, let's assume that the citation is used to support a method or a finding in the current study. That would fall under the Usage class since they might be referring to a method or dataset. If it's comparing results, then CoCoRes might be applicable. If it's just providing background without comparison, Neutral could be the third choice.

Wait, without the exact context, this is speculative. But based on common scenarios, I can outline a possible classification. Maybe the citation is used to support a method, so Usage is first. If it's comparing their results with others, CoCoRes could be second. If it's just a neutral mention without comparison, Neutral is third.

I think that's a reasonable approach given the lack of specific information.

1. Usage  
2. CoCoRes  
3. Neutral
