Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the provided scientific passage into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. First, I'll start by extracting the context around the citation to understand its intent.

Looking at the passage, it mentions that "Our finding... is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations..." The citation is cited as supporting their own results. In the example given, the authors are pointing out that their finding is consistent with another study's findings. The example uses the Similar class when a study's results are cited to show alignment with their own. 

So, from the context, the citation is being used to support their work by showing that their findings are similar to another study's. That would fall under the Similar class because the authors are highlighting a similarity between their results and the cited work. 

The next possible class is Support, as the citation is directly used to back up their findings. However, the example in the definitions for Similar was when another study supports the citing paper's results. In our case, the passage says, "supported by" which is more about backing up. So Support might also be applicable here. 

Wait, but looking back at the definitions: Support is when the citation supports the work of the citing authors, which is the case here. So maybe Support is the primary class, and Similar is also relevant because it's a similarity in results. 

Alternatively, since they are pointing out that their finding is similar to another's, maybe Similar is more precise. 

But the context says, "...is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations..." so it's more about supporting than just pointing out similarity. So, first would be Support, and the other could be Similar. 

Wait no, in the example provided for Similar, it says that Similar is when the citation is used to point out a similarity between their work and another's. So in the given passage, they are using the citation to support their work because it shows similar findings. So perhaps Support is the primary class here. 

Alternatively, since they mention "supported by recent cross-taxon investigations...", the citation is being used to back up their own findings, which is Support. 

But in the example of Similar, the paper supports their findings: "Our finding... is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations...", which is almost exactly the example given for Similar. So perhaps I'm confused here. 

The Similar class's example says, "Our finding... is supported by recent cross-taxon...". So in that case, the class is Similar. Therefore, I think the citation is an example of Similar because it's being used to state that their finding is similar to another's. 

Alternatively, the fact that it is supporting their work directly is Support. Hmm, the definitions say that Support is used to support, confirm the work, etc., while Similar is about pointing out a similarity. 

In the given passage, it's both supporting and showing similarity. But the example given under Similar uses the exact wording, "supported by...", so in that case, it would be classified as Similar. 

So, perhaps the primary class is Similar. The other possible classes could be Support and Neutral. 

Wait, Neutral is when the citation is used neutrally without supporting, comparing, etc. In this case, the citation is clearly supporting, so Neutral is less likely. 

So, the top three classes might be Similar (since the example aligns with it), Support (as it's backing the finding), and perhaps Basis if it's foundational. But Basis is more about intellectual foundation, which doesn't seem to apply here. 

Alternatively, if I'm confused between Similar and Support, let me re-examine the definitions. 

Support: used to support or confirm. 

Similar: point out a similarity in results or findings.

The passage says "is supported by", which is more about backing up, so Support is the primary. 

Wait, but in the example under Similar, it's when citing a study to show similarity. So maybe both Similar and Support apply. But I need to pick the top three.

So, perhaps the top is Similar, then Support. Then, is there any neutral aspect? Neutral is when it's just mentioned without supporting or anything. Here, it's definitely supporting, so Neutral is less likely. 

Wait, but another possible class is Basis if it's foundational. Since the study supports their work, it might be a foundation, but I think Support is more accurate.

Alternatively, let me consider the example given under Similar: “Our finding... is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations...”, which is exactly the structure of the passage. So that example uses Similar as the class. 

Thus, the top class should be Similar. Then, if any, Support, but maybe the passage is more about similarity than pure support. 

Alternatively, perhaps the top three are Similar, Support, and Neutral. But that may not be accurate because the citation is clearly being used to show similarity and support, not neutrality.

Wait, in the passage, the citation is showing that the findings are similar to others, which is Similar. It's also supporting because it's backing up their results. So the top two would be Similar and Support. The third might be CoCoRes if they are comparing results, but in this case, they are not directly comparing their results with the cited study, but rather showing that their findings are similar.

So, perhaps the third class is Neutral, but that doesn't make sense because it's not neutral. 

Alternatively, the third could be Basis, but that's about foundational work, not directly applicable here.

I think the correct order is Similar, Support, and perhaps Neutral, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the top is Similar.

But to sum up, the context is about a finding being supported by another study's results, so Similar. Therefore, the top three classes would be Similar, Support, and perhaps Neutral. 

Wait, perhaps the example provided in the definitions for Similar is exactly what we have here. So, the correct classification is Similar as the first, then Support, and maybe Neutral as third, but Neutral doesn't quite fit because it's neither supporting nor similar in a neutral way. 

Therefore, I think the top three are Similar, Support, and then perhaps Neutral, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, maybe Support is the top, then Similar, then something else. 

I think it's best to go with Similar as the first, then Support, and Neutral as third, even though Neutral might not perfectly fit.

1. Similar  
2. Support  
3. Neutral
