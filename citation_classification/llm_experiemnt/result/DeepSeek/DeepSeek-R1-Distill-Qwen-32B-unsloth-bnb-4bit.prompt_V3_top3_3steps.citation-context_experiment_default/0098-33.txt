Alright, let's break down the process for classifying the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions a study where an aphid gut peptide interferes with virus uptake and binds to other aphid species' guts, suggesting broader applicability. The citation is cited as support for this point.

Next, identifying the general intent. The authors are using the citation to back up their findings, indicating a supportive intent.

Now, mapping to the predefined rhetorical classes: this is a clear case of 'Support' because they're confirming their results. There's no comparison, motivation, or weakness involved here. 'Usage' or 'Basis' don't fit since they're not using the method or establishing a foundation. 'Similar' could be a stretch if they're pointing out a similarity, but 'Support' is more accurate here. 'Neutral' doesn't apply because the citation is being used to support their argument.

So, the top three classes are Support, with Similar and Neutral as less relevant.

1. Support  
2. Similar  
3. Neutral
