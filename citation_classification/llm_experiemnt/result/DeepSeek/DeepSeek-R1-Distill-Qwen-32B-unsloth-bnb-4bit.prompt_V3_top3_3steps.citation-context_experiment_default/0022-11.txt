Okay, so I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific passage. Let's break it down step by step. First, I should extract the context where the citation is mentioned. The passage talks about recent studies showing that bacterial communities are influenced by their arthropod hosts. It specifically mentions cross-taxon investigations in fleas and ticks where the host governed bacterial assemblages. The citation is used to support this point.

Next, I'll determine the general intent. The citation is supporting a finding that the authors are making, showing that similar results have been observed in other studies. So it's likely a supportive intent.

Looking at the specific rhetorical classes, Support fits here because the citation is backing up the authors' finding. Similar also applies since it points out that other studies found comparable patterns. Usage might come into play if they're using a method, but that's not the case here. CoCoRes could be considered if comparing results, but the focus is more on similarity than direct comparison. Neutral doesn't fit because the citation isn't just descriptive; it's actively supporting the argument.

So the top three are Support, Similar, and maybe Neutral, but I think the primary is Support followed by Similar, and possibly CoCoRes if considering it as a comparison. But since it's more about similarity, I'll stick with those.

1. Support  
2. Similar  
3. Neutral
