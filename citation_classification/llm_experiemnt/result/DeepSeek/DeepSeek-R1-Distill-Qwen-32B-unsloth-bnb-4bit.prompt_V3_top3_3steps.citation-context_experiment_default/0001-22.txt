Okay, so I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ into the top three rhetorical classes based on the provided definitions. Let me start by understanding the context and the surrounding sentences.

Looking at the passage, the author is discussing their experimental set-up. They mention that it was described in detail previously, citing @@CITATION@@. This seems to be a straightforward reference to a prior work where the method was detailed.

Now, considering the rhetorical classes, this citation is clearly pointing to a method or setup used in the current study. That fits the "Usage" category because it's referring to a method from another work used here.

Is there a possibility of other classes? Well, it's not a comparison (CoCoGM/CoCoRes/CoCoXY), motivation, support, or weakness, because they're not discussing gaps, supporting claims, or criticizing. It's a neutral reference to a prior method used.

So, the primary class is Usage. The other possibilities could be Neutral if it's just a passing mention, but since it's about the method, Usage is more precise. No support or comparison involved here.

1. Usage  
2. Neutral  
3. Basis
