Okay, I need to figure out the top three rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. First, I should extract the context around the citation to understand its role. 

Looking at the passage: The study by @@CITATION@@ reports on the presence of bacterial communities in the roots and leaves of infected plants. The current paper’s findings align with these observations, showing similar patterns.

Step 1 is done; the context is that the current paper’s findings support the cited study's observations on bacterial communities.

Next, the general intent. The current paper is showing agreement with the cited work, so it's supportive. 

Now, assigning specific classes. Support seems the most appropriate, as the citation confirms the findings. Similar is second, as the patterns are aligned. Neutral might be third since it's a basic mention without deeper engagement.

1. Support  
2. Similar  
3. Neutral
