Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in this passage. Let me start by looking at the context provided. The passage says that the study is about identifying and characterizing a phytoplasma in sunflowers and that this is the first report of this disease in sunflowers. They reference @@CITATION@@ in the context of previous studies on similar phytoplasmal diseases in other species. 

First, I need to extract the exact context where @@CITATION@@ is mentioned. The sentence is: "This study is the first report of this disease in sunflowers, following previous studies on similar phytoplasmal diseases in other species @@CITATION@@." So, the citation is referencing other studies that looked at similar diseases but in different species.

Now, I need to determine the general intent of this citation. It seems like the study is pointing out that while their work is a first in sunflowers, there have been similar studies in other plants. This implies that the purpose is to show a connection or similarity with prior research. It's not directly supporting their current results, nor is it comparing methods or results. Instead, it's establishing that the work isn't without precedent and that similar findings have been observed elsewhere.

Looking at the predefined rhetorical classes, the most fitting seems to be 'Similar' because the citation is pointing out that the current findings are similar to those in other studies. There's a comparison, but it's not a direct comparison of methods or results between the citing paper and the cited work; rather, it's highlighting that the phenomenon has been observed in other contexts.

Next, I consider if it fits into another category. Could it be 'Support'? Well, it's not directly supporting their current findings but showing that the occurrence of the disease isn't isolated, so it does add some support in a broader sense. But I think 'Support' is more about confirming results, and 'Similar' is more about pointing out parallels.

Are there any other possible classes? 'CoCoRes' is about comparing results, but here it's more about the existence of similar phenomena rather than specific result comparisons. 'CoCoXY' is about comparing explanations or claims between studies, which isn't exactly the case here.

So, the top class is definitely 'Similar'. For the next, maybe 'Support' because it shows that their finding isn't unique, adding credibility. 'Neutral' could be the third because the citation is also just mentioning prior work without a strong emphasis on supporting or comparing.

1. Similar  
2. Support  
3. Neutral
