Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation marked @@CITATION@@ in the provided passage. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I'll look at the context given. The passage states, "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." My task is to extract the context discussing the citation, which here is that the setup was described before, and the citation is referencing that description.

Next, I need to identify the general intent of the citation. The sentence mentions using a method or setup from a previous study. That seems to fall under the "Usage" category because the authors are referring to a method or setup from another work that they are using in their current study.

Now, I'll consider the predefined rhetorical classes. Usage is clearly one because they're using a prior method. What else could it be? It's not comparing methods (so not CoCoGM), nor is it supporting their results. It's more about applying a known method. So, the primary class should be Usage.

Are there any other potential classes? Let me think. If the citation was comparing their setup to another, maybe CoCoGM, but that's not the case here. They're just stating they used a setup described elsewhere, so Support isn't relevant. Motivation, Basis, or Weakness don't fit either.

Therefore, the top three classes would be: 1. Usage. Since nothing else fits well, the other classes like Neutral or Basis are less likely, but I need to pick three. The next possible might be Neutral because it's a straightforward reference without any comparative or supportive elements. Then, perhaps Basis, but not really. So, I think the best fit is Usage as 1, and then maybe Neutral or something else, but I need to stick to the list.

Wait, looking again, the example for Usage is exactly this scenario: citing a method from another study. So I'm confident about Usage as 1. The other two could be Neutral if it's a neutral mention, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the context was more supportive, but it's not. So, perhaps the next relevant is Neutral. And the third could be Basis, although it's a stretch.

Another thought: Maybe the citation could be seen as providing the basis for their method, thus Basis. But the main intent is about using the method, so Usage is first. Basis would be if they were building on the prior work, but here they're using it, which is Usage. So the hierarchy is clear: Usage first, then Neutral, followed by something else... Wait, perhaps Support is next if they're confirming their setup with prior work, but they're not really supporting their results, just referencing the setup.

Actually, looking at the examples, the Usage example is almost identical: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." So yes, that's definitely Usage. Then, the other two might be less clear. Maybe Neutral because it's a descriptive mention, but the primary is Usage. I think that's the way to go.

1. Usage  
2. Neutral
