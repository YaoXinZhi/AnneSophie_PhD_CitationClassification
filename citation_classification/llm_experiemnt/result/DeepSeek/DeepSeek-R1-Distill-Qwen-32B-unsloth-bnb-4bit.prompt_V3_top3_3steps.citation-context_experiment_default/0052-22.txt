Okay, I need to figure out the top three rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@. First, I look at the context provided. The passage mentions that the work of @@CITATION@@ is complementary and focuses on word embeddings. Comparing this to the current paper's goal, it's clear they're contrasting their approach with the cited work's method. So this is a CoCoGM since they're comparing methods or goals.

Next, the citation is used to highlight a difference in focus. The current paper is about demonstrating human-like biases, while the cited work is about debiasing. This direct comparison of their methods makes CoCoXY a possible second choice because they're contrasting two studies.

Finally, the citation might also be providing support for their approach by referencing another method, though it's more of a comparison than support. So, Neutral could be third since it's not explicitly supporting but just stating another's work.

So, the top three are CoCoGM, CoCoXY, Neutral.

1. CoCoGM  
2. CoCoXY  
3. Neutral
