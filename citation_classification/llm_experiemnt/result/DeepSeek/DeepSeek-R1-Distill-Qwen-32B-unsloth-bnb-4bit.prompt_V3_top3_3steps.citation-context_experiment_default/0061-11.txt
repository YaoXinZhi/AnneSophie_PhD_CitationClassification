Okay, I need to classify the given citation @@CITATION@@ into the top three rhetorical classes. Let me follow the steps provided.

First, I'll extract the context discussing the citation. The passage is: "The experiment was conducted in a controlled environment to measure the growth rate of the plant under varying light conditions. This setup was similar to the methodology used by @@CITATION@@ in their study on plant photosynthesis efficiency. Our findings align with their results, showing increased growth under moderate light exposure."

Now, I need to identify the general intent of the citation. The text mentions that their methodology is similar and their findings align, which suggests that the citation is used to support their results by showing similarity.

Next, I'll map this to the predefined rhetorical classes. The primary class is Support because the citation confirms their findings. Similar is also relevant as it points out the methodology similarity. Additionally, there's a neutral mention without any critical or comparative intent beyond that, so Neutral could be third.

So, the top three are Support, Similar, Neutral.

1. Support  
2. Similar  
3. Neutral
