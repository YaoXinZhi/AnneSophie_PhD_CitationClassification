Alright, I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the context provided. The first step is to extract the context. In the given text, the citation is part of a sentence that discusses previous research showing a 15-30 mm increase in tree height with mycorrhizal infection. The authors then mention their own study, which is similar but focuses on growth in containerized seedlings under controlled conditions. 

Next, I need to determine the general intent. The sentence uses the citation to present earlier findings and then explains how their study builds upon it. This suggests that the citation is supporting their current work by showing a foundation or prior research. 

Looking at the predefined classes, this seems to align with the 'Basis' class because the cited work provides the intellectual foundation for the current research. The authors are replicating or extending previous studies, which is a hallmark of using a citation as a basis.

Then, considering comparative aspects, since the authors are discussing their own study in relation to the cited work, it might touch on 'CoCoRes' as comparing results. However, the primary intent here is more about establishing a foundation rather than directly comparing results.

Lastly, the context doesn't indicate any criticism or support beyond the foundation, so 'Similar' might be less applicable here. The use isn't about comparing methods or goals enough for 'CoCoGM' or 'CoCoXY'. The citation primarily serves as a basis for their own study.

So, the top classes would be Basis first, then Similar as a secondary, and since there's no direct comparison of results, CoCoRes could be third.

1. Basis  
2. Similar  
3. CoCoRes
