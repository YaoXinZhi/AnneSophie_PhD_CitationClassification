Alright, I need to figure out the top three rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me go through the process step by step.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage says that the formation of hard calcite scale can be prevented with a magnetic field, but the mechanism isn't explained yet. This research aims to understand that mechanism, referencing their previous work.

Next, I'll identify the general intent. The citation is used to justify why this current research is being done, pointing out that while they've seen effects, the underlying cause isn't known. This seems to fall under Motivation.

Now, considering the predefined classes, Motivation is definitely one. Since the citation highlights a knowledge gap and the need for further research, Future could be the next. It's suggesting a direction because understanding the mechanism is the purpose of the current work. However, it doesn't compare methods or results directly with others, so CoCoGM or CoCoRes might not fit as well.

So, the top three would be Motivation as the primary, Future as the next, and Neutral might apply if the citation is just stating a previous result without explicitly linking to future work, but here it's more about motivation.

1. Motivation  
2. Future  
3. Neutral
