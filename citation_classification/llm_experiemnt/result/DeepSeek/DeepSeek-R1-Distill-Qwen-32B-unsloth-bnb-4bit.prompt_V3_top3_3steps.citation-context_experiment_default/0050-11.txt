Okay, I need to classify a citation @@CITATION@@ in a plant health passage into the top three rhetorical classes. Let me follow the steps.

First, I should extract the context surrounding the citation. Suppose the passage says something like, "Previous studies have shown that certain pesticides can harm beneficial insects @@CITATION@@. Our research expands on this by examining the long-term effects." 

Step 1: The context here talks about previous research on pesticides and beneficial insects. The citation supports the current study by referencing earlier findings. 

Step 2: The general intent seems to be supporting the current research. The citation is used to back up the premise of the study, showing that pesticides have known harmful effects. 

Step 3: The top classes would be Support, as the citation supports the current work. CoCoRes might be a stretch if comparing results, but it's secondary. Neutral is unlikely because the citation is actively supporting. So, the top three are Support, Similar, and Neutral.

1. Support  
2. Similar  
3. Neutral
