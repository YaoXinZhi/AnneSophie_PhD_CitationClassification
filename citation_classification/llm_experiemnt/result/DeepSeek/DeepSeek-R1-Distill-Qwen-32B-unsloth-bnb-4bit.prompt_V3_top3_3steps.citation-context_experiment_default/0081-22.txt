Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in this passage. First, I need to extract the context around it. The passage says, "In the present work, we analyzed the molecular mechanisms underlying..." and mentions that they found results supporting previous findings in @@CITATION@@ and another study. The key here is that the authors are saying their results support what was previously found. So the citation is being used to back up their own findings.

Looking at the definitions, Support is when the citation confirms or supports the work of the authors. That seems to fit here because the authors are directly stating that their results align with the cited work. 

Next, they mention how their findings support previous results, which could imply a similarity in outcomes between studies. So Similar might also be relevant because it's highlighting that the results are in line with each other.

I don't think it's Comparative (like CoCoRes or CoCoGM) because they're not contrasting but rather agreeing. It's not Motivational or Future as they're not discussing why they're doing the research or suggesting future directions. They're not using the citation for a method or discussing weaknesses either. So the top three would be Support, followed by Similar, and perhaps Neutral because if they just described the previous work without explicit support, but in this case, the context shows supportiveness. 

Wait, actually, if the citation is simply mentioned in the context of supporting their results, the primary classification is Support. The next could be Neutral if the citation is just stating previous findings without explicitly supporting, but in this context, the focus is on supporting, so Maybe Similar is second if the comparison is about similarity in results. But I'm not sure if it's a direct comparison or just a support. So perhaps the top three are Support, Similar, and then maybe Neutral if applicable, but in this case, I think the main is Support, maybe Same and then Support is the same, so perhaps Similar is second, and then another category like Neutral if needed.

But according to the task, I should output three classes. So I'll go with Support as the most appropriate, then Similar because the results are similar, and then maybe Neutral if they're just stating the previous work without any direct comparison or support beyond that.

1. Support  
2. Similar  
3. Neutral
