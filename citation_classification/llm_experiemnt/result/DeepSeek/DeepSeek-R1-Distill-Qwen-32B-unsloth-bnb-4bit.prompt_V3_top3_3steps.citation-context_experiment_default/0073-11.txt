Alright, I'm faced with classifying a citation in a scientific passage related to plant health. The citation is marked @@CITATION@@, and I need to determine the top three rhetorical classes from the list provided.

First, I'll start by extracting the context surrounding the citation. The passage mentions the citation in the context of discussing specific studies related to the multiplication rates of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains. It states that Fast multiplication rates and high concentration were reported in young developing leaves and roots of infected daisy plants, referencing Wei et al., 2004, and Saracco et al., 2006. However, conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima, cited here as @@CITATION@@.

Step two is identifying the general intent of this citation. The context is comparing results from different studies regarding phytoplasma. The citation is pointing out conflicting results between the current work and another study, which suggests a comparative intent. Specifically, it's about the results of the cited work conflicting with the present findings.

Now, moving on to step three, I need to rank the rhetorical classes. The primary class here is CoCoRes since the citation is directly comparing results. There's a mention of conflicting results, which indicates a contrast between the cited and current work. 

Next, since the citation is comparing two studies with each other (Wei et al. and Saracco et al.), but in the given passage, it's using these to compare with another cited work, so CoCoXY is also relevant but perhaps a bit secondary because the main focus is on the comparison of results.

Finally, the citation might also serve a Neutral purpose, as it's providing information without necessarily supporting or directly criticizing, but more as a neutral piece of information about the conflicting results in the literature. However, since the primary intent is comparative, Neutral might be tertiary.

So, the top three classes are CoCoRes, CoCoXY, and Neutral.

1. CoCoRes  
2. CoCoXY  
3. Neutral
