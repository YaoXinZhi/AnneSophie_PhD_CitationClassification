Okay, I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage into the top three rhetorical classes. Let me follow the steps provided.

Step 1: Extract the context around @@CITATION@@. The passage says that a study found high concentrations of a phytoplasma strain in daisy plants, while conflicting results were found for another phytoplasma in Euphorbia. The citation is used to show these conflicting results.

Step 2: Determine the general intent. The citation is comparing two studies to show conflicting findings. This falls under a comparative intent, specifically CoCoRes since it's comparing results.

Step 3: Identify the top three rhetorical classes. The primary class is CoCoRes because it's directly comparing results. Next, since it's comparing two other studies, CoCoXY is relevant. Finally, it's showing conflicting results, which might also relate to Weakness in one of the studies but less directly. So, the top three are CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Weakness.
