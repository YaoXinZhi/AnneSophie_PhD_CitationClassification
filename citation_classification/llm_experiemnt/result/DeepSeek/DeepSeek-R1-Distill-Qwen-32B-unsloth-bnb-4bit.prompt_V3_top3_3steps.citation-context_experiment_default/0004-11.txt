Okay, I'm trying to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me break it down step by step.

Step 1: Extract the context discussing the citation @@CITATION@@. The passage mentions that "Our previous research @@CITATION@@ has shown that the formation of the hard calcite scale on the surfaces exposed to hard water can ... The explanation of the phenomena is not yet offered and the purpose of this work is to try to understand the mechanism ..."

So, the context is about previous research that demonstrated a phenomenon, but the explanation is missing, which motivates the current study.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation is referring to prior work that shows a phenomenon without explaining it, which suggests that the current research is motivated by filling this knowledge gap. So the general intent is Motivational.

Step 3: Assign the most appropriate rhetorical classes. Since the citation is used to justify why the current research is needed, the primary class is Motivation. The other options, perhaps Neutral, if it were just a neutral mention, but here it's about justifying the current study. There's no comparison, support, or usage here. So:

1. Motivation
2. Neutral (if any)
3. Basis (as a fallback, but less likely)
</think>

1. Motivation  
2. Neutral  
3. Basis
