Alright, I need to assign the top three rhetorical classes to the citation @@CITATION@@ in the passage. The task is to analyze the context where the citation is used and determine its purpose based on the predefined classes.

First, I should extract the context. The passage mentions that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly, referencing previous work, and uses @@CITATION@@ to support this finding. The citation is pointing out that similar patterns were observed in fleas and ticks, where the host influenced bacterial assemblages.

Next, identifying the general intent. Since the citation is supporting the current finding and showing similar results, it seems supportive. So, the intent is supportive.

Now, looking at the specific classes, the citation is used to support the current work by referencing similar findings. That's a "Support" class. Additionally, it highlights similarity in results, which could also fall under "Similar." Lastly, if the citation is just describing the fact without directly supporting or comparing, it might be "Neutral." 

So, ranking them, the most appropriate is Support, followed by Similar, and then Neutral.

1. Support  
2. Similar  
3. Neutral
