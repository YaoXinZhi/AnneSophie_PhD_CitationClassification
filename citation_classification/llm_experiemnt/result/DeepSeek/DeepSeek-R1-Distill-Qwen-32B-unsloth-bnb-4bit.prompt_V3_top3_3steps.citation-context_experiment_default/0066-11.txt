Alright, so I've got a citation in a plant health article, tagged as @@CITATION@@, and I need to figure out its rhetorical class. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll extract the context where the citation is mentioned. It says, "Earlier studies have identified that plant species vary in their ability to resist pathogen attacks @@CITATION@@." Okay, so the context is about prior research showing variation in plant resistance to pathogens.

Next, I'll identify the general intent. The sentence uses the citation to back up the claim about varying plant resistance. It seems like the citation is supporting the authors' point by referencing previous findings. So, the intent is supportive.

Now, looking at the predefined classes, the most fitting ones for support are "Support" and "Similar". Since the citation is directly supporting the current work's assertion, "Support" is the primary class. "Similar" could also fit because it points out a similarity in findings. "Neutral" is possible if the mention is just informative without support, but the way it's used here leans towards supporting. 

I don't see any comparative elements, so classes like CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY aren't applicable. There's no motivation for future research or pointing out weaknesses either. The main classes are Support, then Similar, and maybe Neutral as a third option.

1. Support  
2. Similar  
3. Neutral
