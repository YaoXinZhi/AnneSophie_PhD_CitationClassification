Okay, I need to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage, which is about plant health. Let's see.

First, extract the context discussing @@CITATION@@. The passage says that in a study of daisy plants, researchers found high concentrations of 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains in young leaves and roots. Then, it mentions conflicting results in another study @@CITATION@@ regarding a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima.

So, the context is that two studies are being compared. One reports high concentrations, and the other found conflicting results. They're comparing results from different studies.

Next, identify the general intent. It seems like the authors are comparing the findings of two studies, so it's a comparative context. That points towards one of the comparative classes.

Looking at the definitions:
- CoCoRes is for comparing results of the current paper with cited work.
- CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies with each other, not with the current paper.

In this case, the current paper is comparing two prior studies, so it's CoCoXY. The primary intent is to contrast their results.

Then, supporting classes. Since they're both cited to show differing results, maybe Support isn't the right term. Neutral might apply because the citation is presenting facts without directly aligning with the current paper's argument beyond comparison.

Also, since they're showing conflicting results, maybe Weakness could apply if pointing out issues with the cited study, but the passage seems to just state the findings without criticism. So Weakness might not be the best fit.

Alternatively, Neutral because it's just presenting the conflicting findings without a clear stance.

So, the top three would be CoCoXY, then Neutral, and maybe Support if the conflicting results support a point, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, Neutral could be third if another class fits better.

Wait, maybe Support if the conflicting results support the idea of variability in findings. Or Similar, but I don't think Similar fits here since they're contrasting.

I think the correct order is:

1. CoCoXY (comparing two citations)
2. Neutral (presenting facts without explicit support)
3. Weakness (if the conflict implies a problem in one of the studies, but not clearly stated)

Alternatively, 1. CoCoXY, 2. Similar, but no, it's not similar results, they're conflicting.

Another angle: The passage is pointing out conflicting results, so it's showing a contrast, which is CoCoXY. Since the current paper uses both to show a point, they might be using it to highlight the need for further research, but that's a stretch.

Wait, the passage doesn't directly mention their own work, so it's more about using the citation to compare two others. So, it's definitely CoCoXY because it's comparing two cited studies. Then, the next is Neutral because they're stating the findings without explicit alignment. Third, maybe Support if they're using it to back up their own point about variability.

Wait, actually, the authors are pointing out conflicting results from the cited studies, which could imply that there's an issue or inconsistency in the literature, which might be seen as a weakness in the cited works. So Weakness might be applicable as a lower rank.

Alternatively, since they are using it to show a general point about differing results, Neutral is still a good second.

So, top three would be:

1. CoCoXY
2. Neutral
3. Weakness

1. CoCoXY  
2. Neutral  
3. Weakness
