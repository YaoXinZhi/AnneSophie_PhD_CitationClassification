Okay, I'm trying to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ from the given passage. Let me start by extracting the context. The passage says that "The taxonomic status of these species is problematic and some may not develop on Pyrus." It then cites a source. 

Next, I need to determine the general intent. The statement is pointing out that there's a problem with the taxonomic classification of certain species. The citation is used to highlight an issue with the cited work, suggesting it's flawed. 

So, the general intent here seems to be critical or analytical. Looking at the fine-grained classes, the most appropriate would be 'Weakness' because the citation is pointing out shortcomings in the cited work. 

No other intents like support, comparison, or motivation seem relevant here since the focus is on criticizing the cited study's findings. Therefore, 'Weakness' is clearly the primary class. The other options don't fit as well because the context doesn't mention motivation, future work, or similarity; it's purely about the cited work's issues.

1. Weakness  
2. Neutral  
3. Support
