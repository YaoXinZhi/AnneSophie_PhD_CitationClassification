Okay, so I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ from the given scientific passage. Let's start by understanding the context. 

The passage says that the researchers built upon an existing method for detecting plant pathogens in the field. They mention that the method is widely used and reliable. So, the citation is about a method that's being utilized here.

Looking at the definitions, "Usage" refers to citing a method or tool that's directly used in the current study. Since they're building upon this method, it fits as a usage because the cited work's method is being employed here.

Next, "Support" is when the citation supports the current work's findings. In this case, the existing method's reliability supports the validity of the new approach they're building upon it. So, it also serves as support.

Lastly, "Neutral" is when the citation is mentioned without supporting, comparing, or criticizing. While the citation is used for support, the primary intent is usage, so neutral is less likely but could be third.

So, the top three classes are Usage, Support, Neutral.

1. Usage  
2. Support  
3. Neutral
