Alright, let's tackle this problem. I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ from the provided context into the top three rhetorical classes. 

First, I'll extract the context around @@CITATION@@. Looking at the passage, the sentence reads: "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria @@CITATION@@."

The intent here seems to be supporting the current research. The authors are citing another study that provides backing for their findings. They mention "supported by" directly, which points towards a supportive role. 

Next, I'll map this to the predefined classes. Since the citation is used to support the current paper's findings, the primary class is Support. There's also an element of Similarity because the cited work discusses similar bacterial assembly in other insects, so Similar could be the second class. The third might be Neutral if the citation is also used in a descriptive manner without direct comparison or criticism.

So, the top three classes would be:
1. Support
2. Similar
3. Neutral

1. Support  
2. Similar  
3. Neutral
