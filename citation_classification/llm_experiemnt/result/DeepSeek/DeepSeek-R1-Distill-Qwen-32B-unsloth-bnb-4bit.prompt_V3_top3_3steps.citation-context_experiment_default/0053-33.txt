Okay, so I'm supposed to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by reading the context carefully.

The passage says, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@."

Step 1: Extracting the context. The main point here is that their current results are compared to previous experiments using deuterium targets. The key words are "differ from the results," which indicates a comparison of findings.

Step 2: Identifying the general intent. Since they are comparing their results with another's results, this falls under the Comparative category. Looking at the list, Comparative includes CoCoGM, CoCoRes, and CoCoXY. The comparison is specifically about results, so that would be CoCoRes.

Step 3: Ranking the classes. The primary class is definitely CoCoRes because it's directly comparing results. Since the passage only compares results, there's no mention of goals, methods, or other comparisons, so CoCoGM and CoCoXY are less likely. The next possible could be Neutral if there's no indication of support or weakness, but since the comparison is critical, it might lean towards a negative view, but the example shows it's just stating a difference, not necessarily weakness. However, since there are only three classes, the next ones would be the other Comparative classes. But in this case, since it's strictly about results, the other options like Neutral or Support aren't as relevant.

Wait, the passage only talks about differing results. So maybe the comparison is just factual without implying support or weakness. Therefore, CoCoRes is the most appropriate. The other two might be Neutral or maybe Usage if they mentioned using the method, but they didn't. So perhaps the next classes are Neutral and then CoCoXY, but in this case, since it's not comparing two cited works, CoCoXY isn't applicable. So maybe Neutral and Usage aren't applicable either. So the top three would be CoCoRes as 1, then since only one applicable, maybe Neutral or CoCoGM, but no, the primary is CoCoRes, then perhaps the next is Neutral because it's just stating a fact, but in the example, it's part of a comparison, so maybe CoCoXY isn't applicable here. Wait, in the example, the comparison is with another work, not between two cited works, so CoCoRes is correct.

So the top three would be:

1. CoCoRes

Then, perhaps Basis because they're using prior results as a foundation, but in the example, the basis is just to compare, not to establish a foundation. So maybe the next is Neutral because it's a straightforward comparison without supporting or discrediting.

Wait, the passage says the results differ, which is a form of comparison but not necessarily support or weakness. So maybe Neutral is second, and then perhaps CoCoXY, but that's for comparing two cited works, which isn't the case here. So perhaps the next is Neutral and then maybe CoCoXY as third, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the top is CoCoRes, second is Neutral, and third is Support, but that doesn't make sense here. Hmm.

Alternatively, since the comparison is about results, the most specific is CoCoRes, then maybe CoCoXY isn't applicable, so the next is Neutral. Then maybe CoCoGM if there's a method difference, but the passage doesn't mention methods, only results. So the top three would be:

1. CoCoRes

2. Neutral

3. CoCoXY (but that's probably not applicable, so maybe Basis isn't applicable either. Alternatively, perhaps 1. CoCoRes, 2. Neutral, 3. Basis if the cited work is foundational, but the passage just uses it for comparison, not as a foundation.

Wait, the passage is comparing results, so Basis isn't the intent. So the top three are:

1. CoCoRes

2. Neutral

3. Basis (unlikely)

Or maybe 1. CoCoRes, 2. Neutral, 3. Support.

Wait, the example shows that the comparison is stating a difference without implying support, so maybe Neutral is second.

Alternatively, maybe it's also similar to the cited work in some way, but the passage states it's different, so Similar isn't appropriate.

I think the top three would be CoCoRes as the most relevant, then Neutral, and then perhaps CoCoXY if the comparison involved another cited work, but in this case, it's only comparing to one, so CoCoXY isn't applicable. So perhaps 1. CoCoRes, 2. Neutral, 3. CoCoGM (if mentioning methods, but it's only results). Alternatively, maybe 1. CoCoRes, 2. Neutral, 3. Support, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, in the example, they just state the results differ; it's a neutral comparison without supporting or discrediting. So maybe Neutral is second. But in the context, it's part of establishing their own results, so maybe Basis is involved. But the passage isn't using the cited work as a foundation but only for comparison.

I think the correct ranking is:

1. CoCoRes

2. Neutral

3. CoCoXY

But since CoCoXY requires comparing two cited works, which isn't the case here, maybe it's not applicable. So perhaps 1. CoCoRes, 2. Neutral, and 3. Similar if they mention similarity, but it's difference, so Similar is out. Maybe 1. CoCoRes, 2. Neutral, 3. Support.

Alternatively, perhaps the next is Basis as the cited work provides the foundation for comparison, so 2. Basis.

I'm a bit confused, but I'll go with:

1. CoCoRes

2. Basis

3. Neutral

But wait, in the example, they just compare the results without using the cited work as a foundation, so Basis might not be the case. So perhaps 1. CoCoRes, 2. Neutral, 3. CoCoXY (though not applicable).

Alternatively, maybe 1. CoCoRes, 2. Neutral, 3. Support.

Wait, no, because it's a difference, not a support.

Perhaps it's best to stick with CoCoRes as the main, and then since there are no other comparisons, the other classes are not applicable, so maybe Neutral and then Usage, but that's not relevant here.

I think the top three would be:

1. CoCoRes

2. Neutral

3. CoCoXY

But I'm not entirely sure about the third. Alternatively, just CoCoRes, Neutral, and then nothing else, but the question requires three, so perhaps Basis as a stretch.

1. CoCoRes  
2. Neutral  
3. Basis
