Okay, I'm trying to classify the reference in the citation passage. Let me follow the steps. 

First, I need to extract the context around @@CITATION@@. The passage says that recent research has shown conflicting results about where phytoplasma multiplication occurs in daisy and other plants. It mentions two studies by Wei et al. and Saracco et al., and another study by @@CITATION@@ that found multiplication in the roots instead of the flowers.

The general intent here is to compare different studies. The passage is pointing out that other studies have conflicting results, so the citation is being used to show a contrast in findings. This seems like a comparison of results with other studies, not directly with the current paper's results.

Looking at the predefined classes, CoCoXY fits because it's comparing two cited works. The citation is showing that one study says roots and another says flowers, highlighting a conflict. 

Next, the class CoCoRes could also apply because it's contrasting results from different studies. Although it's not comparing with the current paper's results, it's still about comparing results between cited works, which is part of CoCoRes.

Neutral might be considered, but the context is clearly using the reference to point out a difference, so it's more about comparison than a neutral mention.

So, the top three classes are CoCoXY (1), CoCoRes (2), and Neutral (3) is lower since it's not purely descriptive.

1. CoCoXY  
2. CoCoRes  
3. Neutral
