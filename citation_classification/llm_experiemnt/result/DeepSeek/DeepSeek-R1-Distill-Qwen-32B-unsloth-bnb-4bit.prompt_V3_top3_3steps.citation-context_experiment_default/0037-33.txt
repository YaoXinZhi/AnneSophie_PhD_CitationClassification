Okay, so Iâ€™m trying to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation tagged @@CITATION@@. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, I need to extract the context surrounding @@CITATION@@. The passage mentions that in fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages, whereas rodent hosts and environmental conditions didn't. The citation is pointing out a similarity in findings.

Next, I should identify the general intent of the citation. It seems like the reference is showing a similarity, as the citing paper's results are consistent with another study. So the general intent is supportive or similar.

Looking at the predefined classes, the most specific one would be 'Similar' because it highlights a similarity between studies. Then, 'Support' might also apply since it confirms the findings. 'Neutral' could be third if the citation is used descriptively without much analysis.

1. Similar  
2. Support  
3. Neutral
