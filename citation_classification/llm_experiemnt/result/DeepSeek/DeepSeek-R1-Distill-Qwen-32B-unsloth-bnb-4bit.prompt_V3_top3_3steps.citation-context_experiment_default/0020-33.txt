Okay, I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by understanding the context.

The passage is about a study that investigates the effect of different plant species on the population of beneficial insects in an agricultural setting. They specifically mention that their findings are in line with previous research by Smith et al. (2015), which reported similar trends in neighboring regions.

Step 1: Extract the context. The study is comparing their results with Smith et al. and notes similarity.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. Since they're saying their findings align with previous work, it's supportive.

Step 3: Assign specific classes. The primary class is Support because it confirms their results. Similar is next because it points out the similarity. Neutral isn't applicable because it's part of their argument, not a descriptive mention.

So, the top three classes are Support, Similar, and Neutral isn't relevant here.

1. Support  
2. Similar  
3. Neutral
