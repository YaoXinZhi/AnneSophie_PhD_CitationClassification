Alright, I need to figure out the top three rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the provided scientific passage. Let me go through the steps as outlined.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the study found conflicting results between two cited works regarding the multiplication rates of two strains in different plant parts. It then refers to another study @@CITATION@@ that reported conflicting results for a phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima.

Now, I'll identify the general intent. The context is comparing two studies and their results, highlighting discrepancies. This points towards a Comparative intent, specifically related to results.

Looking at the predefined classes, CoCoRes fits because it involves comparing results. The citation is showing that another study also had conflicting results, supporting the idea of comparison.

The context is comparing the cited work directly with another study, not with the current paper or each other. So CoCoXY might also be relevant, as it's about comparing explanations or claims between two studies.

Lastly, since the citation is presented neutrally to show that similar issues were found elsewhere, Neutral could also be applicable, though it's less primary than the first two.

1. CoCoRes  
2. CoCoXY  
3. Neutral
