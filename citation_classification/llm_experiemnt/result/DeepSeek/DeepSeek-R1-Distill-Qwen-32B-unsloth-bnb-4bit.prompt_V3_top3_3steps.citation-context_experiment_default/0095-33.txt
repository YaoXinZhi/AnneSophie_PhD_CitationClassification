Okay, I need to assign the top three rhetorical classes to the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me go through the steps carefully.

First, I'll extract the context. The passage says: "...in a study by @@CITATION@@, researchers observed that exposure to high levels of ozone significantly reduced photosynthesis in wheat plants." 

The general intent here seems to be presenting the cited study's findings, specifically about ozone's effect on wheat photosynthesis. The context is used to show a specific result related to plant health.

Looking at the predefined classes, Support seems the most appropriate. The citation is used to confirm that ozone reduces photosynthesis. Next, Basis might be applicable if the study is foundational, but the context directly supports a point. Neutral could be considered if it's just a statement, but since it's used to back up a result, Support is stronger. Usage is not relevant here. 

So, the top three would be Support, Neutral, and maybe Basis if it's a key study, but in this context, Support is primary.

1. Support  
2. Basis  
3. Neutral
