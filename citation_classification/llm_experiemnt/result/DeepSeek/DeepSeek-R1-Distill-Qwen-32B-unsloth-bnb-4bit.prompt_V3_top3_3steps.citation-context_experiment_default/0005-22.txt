Okay, so I have to figure out the top three rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let's start by understanding the context. The passage says that previous studies have identified several factors influencing the formation of biofilms. Then it mentions that recent advances have enabled a deeper understanding, with one such study highlighting specific factors using multi-dimensional analysis. It cites @@CITATION@@ for this study.

Now, looking at the predefined classes. The citation is referring to a study that provides a foundation for the current research by highlighting certain factors. So that points to Basis. Also, the study is being used to support the current work's findings, making Support another good fit. Lastly, the citation describes the cited work as a key study, which could indicate Similar because it's pointing out a similarity in the approach or findings. So I'm thinking Basis, Support, Similar are the top three.

1. Basis  
2. Support  
3. Similar
