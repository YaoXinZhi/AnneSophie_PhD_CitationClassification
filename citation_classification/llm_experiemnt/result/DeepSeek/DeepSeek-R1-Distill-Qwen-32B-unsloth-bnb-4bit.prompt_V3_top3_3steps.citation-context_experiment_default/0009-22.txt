Alright, I'm a classifier trying to figure out the top three rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific passage. Let's break this down step by step.

Step 1: Extract the context discussing the citation. I need to understand where and how @@CITATION@@ is mentioned, what the surrounding text is saying. Without specific details about the passage, I might have to make some educated guesses.

Step 2: Identify the general intent of the citation. The intent could be foundational, comparative, motivational, supportive, technical, critical, or descriptive. Considering the predefined classes, I need to map this intent to the appropriate categories.

Step 3: Rank the top three specific rhetorical classes. I have to choose from Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Motivation, Future, Support, Similar, Usage, Weakness, Neutral based on how well they fit the context.

Assuming the citation is used to compare findings with another study without mentioning the current paper, CoCoXY might be appropriate. If the citation supports the current argument, then Support. If it's pointing out similarities in results, Similar.

1. CoCoXY  
2. Support  
3. Similar
