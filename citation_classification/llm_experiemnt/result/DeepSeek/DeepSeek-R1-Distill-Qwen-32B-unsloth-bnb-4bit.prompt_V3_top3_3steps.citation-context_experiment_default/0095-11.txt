Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the correct rhetorical classes for this citation in the passage. First, I need to extract the context. The example given was about cross-taxon investigations showing similar results in different hosts, and the cited work supports that insects affect bacterial communities. 

The general intent seems supportive because the citation is used to back up the current findings. So, the first class is Support. 

Next, since it's showing similar findings without directly comparing, it's similar to the Similar class. So, Similar is second.

Lastly, while not as strong as Support, there's a descriptive element, so Neutral could be third.

To determine the rhetorical classes for the given citation context, we first observe that the citation is used to support the current findings by referencing similar results in other studies. This indicates a supportive intent. The presence of similar cross-taxonomic studies suggests a point of similarity. Finally, the citation is used descriptively without necessarily comparing or contrasting beyond supporting the current work.

1. Support  
2. Similar  
3. Neutral
