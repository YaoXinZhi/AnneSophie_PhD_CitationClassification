Alright, I'm supposed to figure out the top three rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the passage. Let's start by understanding the context. The passage mentions that the reference discusses studies on the distribution and genetic diversity of Phytophthora infestans in Europe. It also points out that the citation describes contrasting results regarding the genetic diversity in the Iberian Peninsula. 

So, the general intent here is comparing results from different studies, specifically contrasting the findings about genetic diversity in that region. This suggests a comparative intent, which is associated with the CoCoRes class because it's about comparing results. 

Next, the passage is discussing the cited work along with another study, using them to highlight differing outcomes. This could also fall under CoCoXY since it's comparing explanations or claims between two cited works, not necessarily the current study. 

On a less direct note, the mention of the previous studies might be setting up a foundation for the current work's motivation or supporting their approach. So, Neutral could be a consideration if the citation is just providing background without a direct comparison. 

So, the top three would likely be CoCoRes, followed by CoCoXY, and then Neutral as a possible secondary role. It's about comparing the cited results and their explanations, while also serving as background information.

1. CoCoRes  
2. CoCoXY  
3. Neutral
