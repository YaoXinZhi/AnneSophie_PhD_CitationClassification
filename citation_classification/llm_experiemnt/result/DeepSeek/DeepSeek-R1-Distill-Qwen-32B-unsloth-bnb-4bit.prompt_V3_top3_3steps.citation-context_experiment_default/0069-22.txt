Alright, I need to determine the top three rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. First, I'll look at the context provided. The context mentions a study on fast multiplication rates and high concentration of certain strains in infected daisy plants. It also brings up conflicting results for another phytoplasma in a different plant species. 

The citation is used to note that conflicting results have been described in another study, which is about a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima. This suggests that the authors are comparing two studies to highlight a contradiction. 

Looking at the definitions, the citation is used to compare or contrast two cited studies rather than the citing paper. That directly points to CoCoXY. The general intent seems Comparative, specifically about comparing explanations or claims between two studies. 

Next, while CoCoRes involves comparing results with the citing paper, here it's about two other studies, so CoCoXY is the primary. If I consider other possibilities, the citation could be seen as pointing out a similarity in results, which would fall under Similar, but since it's about conflict, CoCoXY is more accurate. 

Another possible class is Support, but the citation isn't supporting the current paper's findings; it's highlighting a conflict between other studies. Therefore, the top three would be CoCoXY as the most appropriate, followed by Similar (though less directly), and then maybe Neutral if there's a descriptive element, but CoCoXY is the clear first choice.

1. CoCoXY  
2. Similar  
3. Neutral
