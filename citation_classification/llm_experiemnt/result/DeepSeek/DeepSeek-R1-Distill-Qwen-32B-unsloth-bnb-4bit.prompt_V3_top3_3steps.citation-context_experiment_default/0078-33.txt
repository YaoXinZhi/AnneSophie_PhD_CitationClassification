Okay, let's try to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given plant health context. 

First, I need to extract the context where the citation is used. The passage mentions using a magnetic treatment to prevent hard calcite scale formation, and they're trying to understand the mechanism. They reference their previous work which showed the effectiveness but not the mechanism. 

Next, I'll determine the general intent of the citation. This citation is justifying the current research by pointing out a knowledge gapâ€”they've shown prevention but need to explain why. That sounds like "Motivation". 

Then, looking for specific classes. "Motivation" fits because it's explaining why this current study is necessary. "Neutral" might be a stretch if it's just stating facts without an argument. I don't see "Support" here because they're not confirming their own findings but setting up the research purpose. 

So, the top three would be: 1. Motivation, 2. Neutral, 3. Support.

1. Motivation  
2. Neutral  
3. Support
