Okay, I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. First, I'll look at the context around the citation to understand its intent. The passage mentions that researchers observed conflicting results in other studies, specifically citing another study that found high concentrations of a phytoplasma strain. 

Hmm, so the authors are pointing out that another study reported high concentrations, but their own findings might be different or conflicting. This seems like a comparison between two studies. The citation is used to highlight a discrepancy, which might indicate a need to either explain the differences or improve upon the cited work. 

This comparison of findings suggests that the citation is serving to compare results. So, the primary class could be CoCoRes. But the authors are also setting up a contrast to justify their new research, which might mean the citation is also a basis for their motivation. They're using the conflicting result as a foundation to explore further. Additionally, since they're comparing two studies directly without necessarily supporting their own results, CoCoXY might come into play as well because it's about comparing explanations or claims between cited works.

I'm a bit confused between CoCoRes and CoCoXY since CoCoRes is about comparing the results with their own, but here it's more about comparing two cited studies. So CoCoXY might be more appropriate. The citation is used to show a conflicting result between two studies, hence it's a comparison of explanations or claims, making CoCoXY the primary class. Meanwhile, since this context is used to highlight a problem in existing studies, it could also be a basis for motivating their research, and maybe a neutral citation if they're just describing prior work without explicit support or criticism.

Wait, maybe the primary intent is to compare two studies' results, so CoCoRes is about comparing results with their own, but here it's between two different studies. So CoCoXY would be more accurate because it's about comparing claims between cited works. Then, Basis because they're establishing the conflicting literature to motivate their study, and Neutral if they're just stating the prior findings without direct comparison to their work.

I think I need to rank the classes based on how directly the citation is used. The main use here is comparing two studies (CoCoXY). Then, it's serving as a basis for their motivation to conduct the study. Lastly, it's providing a neutral context of prior findings. So the order would be CoCoXY, Basis, then Neutral.

1. CoCoXY  
2. Basis  
3. Neutral
