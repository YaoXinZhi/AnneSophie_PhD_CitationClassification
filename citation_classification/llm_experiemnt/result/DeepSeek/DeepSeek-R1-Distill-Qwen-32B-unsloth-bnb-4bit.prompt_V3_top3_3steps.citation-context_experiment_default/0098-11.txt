Alright, I'm faced with a task where I need to classify a citation in a scientific article passage into one of several predefined rhetorical classes. The passage in question is discussing a study on plant health, specifically looking at how magnetic treatment affects calcite scale formation. The citation is marked as @@CITATION@@. 

Step 1: Extract the context around @@CITATION@@. The sentence says, "Our previous research @@CITATION@@ has shown that the formation of the hard calcite scale on the surfaces exposed to hard water can be successfully prevented with the applied magnetic field." This indicates that the citation is referring to a past study that demonstrated the effectiveness of magnetic fields in scale prevention.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The current research is building on this previous work. It doesn't seem to be comparing methods or results with others, nor is it criticizing or supporting the cited work directly. Instead, it's using the past findings to set the stage for their own research, which aims to understand the underlying mechanism. This looks like it's providing motivation for the current study.

Step 3: Now, assign the top three rhetorical classes. The primary class here is Motivation, as the citation justifies why this research is necessary by pointing out that the mechanism isn't yet understood. Next, it could be Similar because it's showing a consistency in findings, though not explicitly. Lastly, Neutral might be a stretch, but since it's not clearly supporting or comparing, it's the third option. So, the order is Motivation, Similar, then Neutral.

1. Motivation  
2. Similar  
3. Neutral
