Alright, I need to figure out the top three rhetorical classes for the citation marked @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific passage. Let me start by understanding the context and the passage provided. 

The passage discusses the comparison of two studies. It mentions that conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima, citing the work of a specific author. The key here is that the citation is comparing two sets of results or findings. 

Next, I should identify the general intent of this citation. Since the authors are pointing out differing results between their work and the cited study, the intent is comparative. Now, I need to assign specific rhetorical classes based on this.

Looking at the predefined classes, CoCoRes (Comparison of Results) fits because it's used to compare results directly. CoCoXY (Comparison of Explanations or Claims) might also apply if they're contrasting explanations, but it's more about results here. Neutral is a possibility since the citation is presented without explicit support or criticism, just stating facts.

So, the top three would be CoCoRes as the primary class, followed by CoCoXY, and then Neutral.

1. CoCoRes  
2. CoCoXY  
3. Neutral
