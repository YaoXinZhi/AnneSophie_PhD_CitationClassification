Alright, I'm trying to classify the reference @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. The passage discusses plant health and mentions the study of two strains of 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' and their multiplication rates in daisy plants. It also contrasts this with conflicting results from another study on a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima.

First, I need to extract the context around @@CITATION@@. The passage talks about different results from various studies, highlighting contradictions. The key here is that the citation is used to show conflicting results between studies.

Next, determining the general intent. Since the passage is comparing findings from different studies without referencing the current research's methods or motivation, it's a comparative context.

Looking at the predefined classes, the most appropriate would be CoCoRes because it's comparing results. However, since the comparison is between two cited studies, not directly with the current paper, CoCoXY is also fitting. The passage is factual, so Neutral could be a third option as it's not supporting or criticizing beyond stating the facts.

1. CoCoRes  
2. CoCoXY  
3. Neutral
