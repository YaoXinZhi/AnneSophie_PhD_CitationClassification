Okay, so I need to figure out the top three rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage about plant health. Let me start by understanding the context and what each rhetorical class entails.

First, the passage is about the impact of magnetic treatment on scale formation in hard water. The authors mention their previous work and another study by other researchers. They're comparing how magnetic fields affect scale formation, noting differences in the mechanisms observed. 

So, the citation is used to compare their results with another study. This makes me think of CoCoRes because it's about comparing results. But then, the passage also refers to using a method from a previous work, so Usage might be relevant here too. Finally, the citation supports their current findings, so Support could be another class.

I think the top three would be Support as the primary since it's confirming their results, CoCoRes for comparing findings, and Usage for applying the method from the cited work.

1. Support  
2. CoCoRes  
3. Usage
