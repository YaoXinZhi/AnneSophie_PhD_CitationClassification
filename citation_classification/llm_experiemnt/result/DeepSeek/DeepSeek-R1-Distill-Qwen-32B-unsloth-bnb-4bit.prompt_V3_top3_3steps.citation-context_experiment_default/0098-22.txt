Okay, I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage into the top three rhetorical classes. Let's go through the process step by step.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The context provided is: "To further understand the distribution of these beetles, we compared our findings with previous studies @@CITATION@@." This sentence indicates that their current work is building upon previous research.

Next, I'll identify the general intent. The mention of comparing findings suggests a comparison, which falls under the Comparative category. Specifically, they're comparing results from their study with others, so it's about the results.

Looking at the predefined classes, the most appropriate would be CoCoRes, as they're comparing results. Then, since the citation is used to support their analysis by referencing other studies, Support might be the next class. Finally, they're not directly pointing out a flaw, so Weakness is less likely, but perhaps they're using the citation to highlight something, maybe similar patterns, so Neutral could be considered but it's less direct.

Alternatively, since they're using the citation to back their comparison, Support might fit. The next could be Motivation if they're citing to justify their study, but the context is more about comparing, not motivating. CoCoGM is about methods, which isn't directly mentioned here.

So, the top three are CoCoRes, Support, and Neutral.

1. CoCoRes  
2. Support  
3. Neutral
