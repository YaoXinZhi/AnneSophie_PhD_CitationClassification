Okay, I need to figure out the rhetorical class for a citation in a scientific passage about plant health. The citation is marked as @@CITATION@@. Let's start by looking at the context surrounding this citation.

Step 1: Extract the context. The passage states that previous work showed the formation of hard calcite scale on surfaces exposed to hard water could be prevented with a magnetic field. However, the explanation wasn't provided. The current work aims to understand the mechanism.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation is used to highlight a knowledge gap, indicating why the current research was conducted. This falls under the Motivation category.

Step 3: Now, assign specific rhetorical classes. The primary use is Motivation, explaining the gap. It's also similar to Support because it references past findings. However, it might not directly compare methods, so Support is secondary. Neutral is a distant third since the citation isn't just a neutral mention but serves a purpose in motivating the study.

So, the top three classes would be Motivation, Support, then Neutral.

1. Motivation  
2. Support  
3. Neutral
