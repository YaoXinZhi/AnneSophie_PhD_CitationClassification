Okay, so I need to figure out the top three rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me start by extracting the relevant context.

The passage says: "In a comprehensive study of root-knot nematode resistance in tomatoes, Smith et al. (2020) identified several QTLs linked to resistance traits. @@CITATION@@ Furthermore, recent advancements in CRISPR technology have enabled precise editing of these QTLs, paving the way for targeted breeding programs." 

Wait, the @@CITATION@@ here is referencing another study. Looking closer, the sentence after the citation talks about advancements in CRISPR technology enabling precise editing. So the citation by Smith et al. (2020) is supporting the point about targeting QTLs for breeding.

Now, identifying the general intent: This seems to be a supportive use because the authors are using the cited study to back up their discussion about targeted breeding by referencing the identified QTLs. So the intent is Supportive.

Now, mapping to the fine-grained classes. Support is one. Could it also be Neutral? Maybe, but the context isn't just descriptiveâ€”it's actively supporting the argument. CoCoGM or others don't fit here since it's not about comparison. So top classes are Support, possibly Neutral, and maybe Others.

1. Support  
2. Neutral  
3. Basis
