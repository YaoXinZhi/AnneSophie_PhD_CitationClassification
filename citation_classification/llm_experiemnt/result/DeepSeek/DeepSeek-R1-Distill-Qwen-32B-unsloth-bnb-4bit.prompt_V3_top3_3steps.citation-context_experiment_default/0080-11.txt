Okay, I need to figure out the top three rhetorical classes for the citation marked @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific passage. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I should extract the context discussing the citation. The passage mentions that the citation reports findings from experiments with deuterium-saturated metal targets, and the authors contrast their own results with those from the cited work. My next step is to identify the general intent of this citation. Since the authors are comparing their results directly with those reported in the citation, it seems like a comparative context.

Looking at the predefined classes, CoCoRes is about comparing results directly between the cited work and the citing paper. That seems like the most appropriate here. Another possible class is CoCoXY, which involves comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies, but in this case, the comparison is directly with the citing paper's results, not between two citations. So CoCoRes is a stronger fit.

As for a third option, maybe Neutral could apply if the citation is just mentioning the findings without much comparison, but since the authors are contrasting their results, it's more about comparison. Therefore, the top three would be CoCoRes as the primary, followed by CoCoXY as a potential secondary, even though it's less fitting, and then Neutral as the least fitting but still possible in a different context.

Wait, let me reconsider. If the context is strictly about contrasting the results, CoCoRes is spot on. There’s no mention of future research or support, so other classes like Future or Support don’t apply here. The primary focus is on comparing results, so I'm confident CoCoRes is first. CoCoXY is for comparing two other studies, which isn't the case here, so perhaps Neutral is a lower fit because it's just a mention without deeper analysis beyond comparison. Alternatively, if the text had just stated the results without contrasting, Neutral might have been higher, but here the contrast is clear. So, I think the top three are CoCoRes, then CoCoXY because there's a mention of other studies but not directly compared here, and then Neutral.
