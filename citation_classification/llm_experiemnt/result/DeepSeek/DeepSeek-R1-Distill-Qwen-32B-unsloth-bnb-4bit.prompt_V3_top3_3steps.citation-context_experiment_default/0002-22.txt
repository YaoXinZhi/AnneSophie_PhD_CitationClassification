Okay, I need to determine the top three rhetorical classes for the citation tagged @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let's break down the process step by step.

First, I extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the authors observed that the hard calcite scale on surfaces exposed to hard water can be prevented with a magnetic field, referencing @@CITATION@@. The purpose of their current work is to understand the underlying mechanism. 

Next, I identify the general intent of the citation. The authors are citing previous research to establish why they're conducting their current study. They're pointing out that while the phenomenon is known (scale prevention), the mechanism isn't explained, hence their motivation to study it.

Now, for the specific rhetorical classes: 

1. **Motivation**: The citation is used to justify the current research by highlighting a knowledge gap. 
2. **CoCoRes**: There's a comparison of the cited results (scale prevention) with the current study's goal (understanding the mechanism). 
3. **Basis**: The cited work serves as the foundation for their current research, providing the initial observation they're building upon.

So, the top three are Motivation, CoCoRes, and Basis.

1. Motivation  
2. CoCoRes  
3. Basis
