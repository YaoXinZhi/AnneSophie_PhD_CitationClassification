Okay, I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific passage. First, I'll look at how the citation is used in the context. The passage mentions that the cited study found similar results regarding the effectiveness of magnetic fields. This suggests that the citation is supporting the current study's findings.

Next, the general intent seems to be supportive because the authors are backing their results with previous work. The specific rhetorical class here would be Support. 

Then, I consider if it's pointing out a similarity. The passage does mention that it aligns with another study, so Similar is another possible class. 

Lastly, since there's no indication of comparison or usage, the least likely is Neutral. So the top three are Support, Similar, then Neutral.

1. Support  
2. Similar  
3. Neutral
