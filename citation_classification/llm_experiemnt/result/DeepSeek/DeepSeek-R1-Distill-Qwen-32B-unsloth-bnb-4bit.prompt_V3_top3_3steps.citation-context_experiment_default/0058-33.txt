Okay, let me try to figure this out step by step. The task is to classify a citation in a scientific passage into the top three rhetorical classes. The context given is a passage about apple replant disease (ARD) and the role of parasitic plants and rhizobia. The citation @@CITATION@@ is mentioned as having shown that some strains can promote plant growth and reduce the severity of ARD by producing auxin and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid deaminase.

First, I need to extract the context. The sentence is: "Previous studies have shown that some rhizobia and diazotrophic bacteria can promote plant growth and reduce the severity of ARD by producing auxin and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid deaminase @@CITATION@@."

Next, I have to identify the general intent of the citation. The sentence seems to support the argument that these bacteria can affect plant growth and disease severity. The citation is used to back up this claim, so it's likely a supportive context.

Looking at the predefined classes, Support is the most appropriate because the citation is confirming the findings by providing evidence. Are there any other possible classes? It could also relate to Usage, as the bacteria produce specific enzymes that are used in the process, but the main intent is support. CoCoGM or CoCoRes aren't applicable here since there's no comparison mentioned.

So the top three classes would be Support first, then maybe Usage if considering the specific enzymes, but that's less direct. Neutral could be considered if it was just stating a fact without supporting, but since the study supports the point, Support is more accurate.

1. Support  
2. Usage  
3. Neutral
