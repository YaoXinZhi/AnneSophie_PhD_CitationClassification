Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to approach this problem. The task is to classify a citation in a scientific passage into one of several predefined rhetorical classes. The example given uses the citation "Thirunavukkarasu et al. (2019)" and assigns it three classes: Basis, Neutral, and Support. But I need to understand the process behind that decision.

First, I need to understand what each of these classes means. From the definitions provided, Basis refers to foundational work that the current research builds upon. Neutral is when the citation is used in a descriptive manner without supporting or comparing. Support means the citation is used to back up the authors' findings or claims.

Looking at the example sentence: "Thirunavukkarasu et al. (2019) reported a higher level of expression of miRNAs in infected plants." The context here is that the citation is introducing previous findings about miRNA expression in infected plants. The authors are not comparing their results with this study, nor are they using it to support their own findings beyond just stating a fact.

So, Basis makes sense because it's citing prior research that established something the current work might be building upon. Neutral because it's just stating a fact without further comparison or support. Support would be less likely unless the current authors are using this to strengthen their own results, which isn't clear here.

But maybe "Support" is still relevant if the authors are using this previous finding to back up their methodology or hypothesis. It's a bit on the fence, but in the example, it's included as the third class.

So, the top three would logically start with Basis because it's foundational, followed by Neutral for the descriptive use, and then Support if there's any implication of backing up their claims with this prior work.

1. Basis  
2. Neutral  
3. Support
