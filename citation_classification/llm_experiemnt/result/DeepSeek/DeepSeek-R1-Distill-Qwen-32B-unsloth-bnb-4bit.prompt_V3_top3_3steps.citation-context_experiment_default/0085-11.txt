Alright, I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. 

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage states that the citation discusses the multiplication rates and high concentration of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains in daisy plants. It also mentions conflicting results from another study regarding a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima.

Next, I'll determine the general intent. The citation is comparing two studies' findings, highlighting conflicting results. This is about contrasting results between cited works.

Looking at the rhetorical classes, CoCoXY fits since it's comparing explanations or claims between two studies without directly comparing to the citing paper. CoCoRes is next because it's about comparing results, though CoCoXY is more specific. Neutral is possible if the citation is just providing information without explicitly comparing in the current paper, but the context here shows a comparison intent.

So, the top three classes are CoCoXY, CoCoRes, and Neutral.

1. CoCoXY  
2. CoCoRes  
3. Neutral
