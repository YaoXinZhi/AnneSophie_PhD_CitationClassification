Okay, so I need to figure out the top three rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me go through the steps as instructed.

First, I have to extract the context discussing the citation. The passage mentions the citation in the context of introducing "Candidatus Phytoplasma asteris" with four variable groups. It says that this was first reported by another study in 1973. So the key part here is about introducing a concept and citing its origin.

Next, I need to identify the general intent. The citation is used to establish the basis for the current discussion. It's referring to where this classification first came from. So this seems foundational, which points to the 'Basis' class.

Looking at the specific classes, 'Basis' is definitely the primary one here because it's referencing the origin of the classification. The other possibilities might include 'Similar' if it's highlighting a similarity to their work, but it doesn't seem to do that. It's more about the foundational reference.

Are there any other relevant classes? 'Support' could be a stretch if it's backing up their current work, but it seems more like an introduction of the concept rather than supporting their findings. So probably not.

So the top class is 'Basis'. Then, maybe 'Similar' if they're aligning with previous work, but it's not clear. 'Neutral' could be second or third since it's a straightforward reference without much comparison or criticism. Or perhaps 'Support' if they're building on it.

Rounding out the top three, after 'Basis', it's likely 'Similar' and 'Neutral'. That makes sense because they're showing that their work is in line with existing classifications, and the citation serves as a neutral reference without strong supporting or critical elements.

1. Basis  
2. Similar  
3. Neutral
