Okay, so I have to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in this plant health context. Let me follow the steps.

Step 1: Extract the context. The passage says that the study focuses on bacterial community assembly affected by insect hosts, comparing it to other studies on fleas, ticks, and rodents. It mentions that @@CITATION@@ found that rodent hosts had no effect.

Hmmm, this seems like the authors are using the citation to back up their similar findings. So the general intent is supportive.

Step 2: Identify the intent. They're confirming their result by citing another study that shows similar patterns, so it's Supportive or maybe Similar.

Wait, similar would be if they're pointing out similarity between their work and others, and support is about backing their findings.

Here, the citation is used to support their own findings, showing that others have observed the same trend. So that leans towards Support.

But also, they're comparing their results to others, maybe a bit of Similarity.

Wait, the example for Support is when the citation supports their results, and for Similar, it's pointing out similarities but not necessarily supporting.

In this case, they're using @@CITATION@@ to support that rodent hosts don't influence, so it's more about providing support, hence Support.

But considering that they're comparing their study's results with others, maybe CoCoRes is possible.

Wait, no, because CoCoRes is comparing results with the citing paper, but here they’re citing others to support their own findings, not comparing their own with others.

So the top is Support, second could be Similar, and neutral maybe third if it's not clearly critical or anything.

Wait, no, let me think again. The sentence says "supported by recent cross-taxon investigations..." so @@CITATION@@ is used to support their assertion, thus Support is primary. Next, since it's comparing with other studies, it’s similar to theirs, maybe similar. But I think Support is the main one.

Wait, actually, looking back: The general intent might be to support, so the top class is Support. CoCoRes is less likely because they are not comparing their own results with that of the citation, but are using it to support their conclusion. So the three categories would be Support, Similar, and Neutral.

1. Support  
2. Similar  
3. Neutral
