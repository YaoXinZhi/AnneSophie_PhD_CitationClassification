Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical classes for a citation marked @@CITATION@@ in a plant health article. Let me break it down step by step. 

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage says, "Earlier studies have shown that this pathogen can survive for several years in the soil @@CITATION@@." This seems to be citing previous research about the pathogen's survival capability.

Next, I identify the general intent. The citation is supporting the current research by backing up a claim. They are using it to provide evidence for their point about the pathogen's longevity.

Now, I need to rank the rhetorical classes. The primary class is Support since the citation directly supports the current study's point. 

Looking for the next most appropriate, Neutral could fit because the mention is straightforward without any comparison or critique. Thirdly, Motivation might be a stretch if the citation is used to highlight a knowledge gap, but it seems more about supporting the current claim than motivating further research.

So, I think the top three are Support, Neutral, and Motivation.

1. Support  
2. Neutral  
3. Motivation
