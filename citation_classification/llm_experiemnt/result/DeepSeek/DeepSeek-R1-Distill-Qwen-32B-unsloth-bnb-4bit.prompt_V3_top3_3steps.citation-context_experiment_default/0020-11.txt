Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation marked @@CITATION@@ in this passage. Let me start by understanding the context. The passage says that the study shows insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly and refers to another study as support. 

Looking at the definitions, the citation is supporting the current findings, which falls under Support. It's directly confirming the work, so Support is the primary class. There's no comparison or criticism here, so other classes like CoCoRes or Weakness don't apply. The mention isn't about methods or future work either. 

So the top class is Support. The next possible might be Similar if the study is similar in results, but since the citation is explicitly supporting, Support is more accurate. Neutral isn't right because it's not just a mention, it's used to back up the findings.

1. Support  
2. Similar  
3. Neutral
