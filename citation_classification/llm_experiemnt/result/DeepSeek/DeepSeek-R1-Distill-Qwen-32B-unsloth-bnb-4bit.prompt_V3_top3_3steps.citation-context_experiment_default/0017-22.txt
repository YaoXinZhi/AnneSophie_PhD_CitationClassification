Okay, so I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage into the top three most appropriate rhetorical classes. Let's start by looking at the context around the citation. The passage discusses a study where the authors found certain results, and they mention another study by citation @@CITATION@@. The authors are pointing out that while the previous study reported high rates of something, they found conflicting results. 

Hmm, so the general intent here seems to be a comparison between the two studies. They are highlighting that their findings differ from the cited work. So this is more of a Comparative intent rather than Foundational or Supportive. 

Looking at the predefined classes, Comparing methods or results would fall under either CoCoGM or CoCoRes. Since they are contrasting the results obtained from their experiments with those of the cited study, it's more about the results. So CoCoRes would be the primary class here. 

Additionally, since they are pointing out conflicting results from another study, it touches on CoCoXY, which is the comparison of explanations or claims between cited studies. However, the main focus is on comparing their own results with the cited work, so CoCoRes is more appropriate as the first class.

I don't see any indication that the citation is used for Motivation, Support, or Weakness. It's purely about comparing the outcomes of different studies. So, the top three classes would be CoCoRes as the most appropriate, followed by perhaps CoCoXY and Neutral, but Neutral doesn't seem to apply here because they are actively comparing. Maybe CoCoGM if the methods were compared, but since it's the results, CoCoRes takes precedence.

1. CoCoRes  
2. CoCoXY  
3. CoCoGM
