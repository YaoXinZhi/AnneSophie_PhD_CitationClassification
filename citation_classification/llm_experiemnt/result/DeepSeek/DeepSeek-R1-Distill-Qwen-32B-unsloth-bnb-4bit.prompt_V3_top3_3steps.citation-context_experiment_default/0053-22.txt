Okay, let me try to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. 

First, I need to extract the context. From what's given, the passage mentions a study where researchers compared the impact of magnetic fields on reducing calcite scale in hard water. The authors found that while similar methods were used, their results were more significant. They reference @@CITATION@@ to back up their claim that magnetic methods can prevent scale formation.

Looking at the context, it seems like the citation is being used to support their own findings. They mention that other studies have shown the effectiveness of magnetic fields, which aligns with their results. So, the general intent is Support.

Next, I should determine the top three rhetorical classes. The primary one is Support because the citation is confirming their results. Secondary might be Similar, as it points out that other studies have found similar outcomes. Tertiary could be Usage, since the study references a method that's been used before, but it's less direct here.

So, the order is Support, Similar, Usage.

1. Support  
2. Similar  
3. Usage
