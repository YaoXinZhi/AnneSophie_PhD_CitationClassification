Okay, so I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in a given passage. Let me first read the context carefully to understand the intent behind the citation. The passage mentions that the citation discusses research which "has shown that the formation of hard calcite scale can be prevented with a magnetic field." The current paper aims to explain the mechanism of this effect. 

This suggests that the citation provides the foundation for the current research. It seems like the authors are building on previous work that established the phenomenon. The citation introduces the problem that the current study is addressing, so it's a basis for their research. 

Looking at the predefined classes: 

1. Basis is definitely relevant because the citation sets the stage for the current work.
2. Support might also apply because the previous work supports the current study's premise.
3. Usage could be considered if they are using a method, but in this case, it's more about the result supporting their motivation.

I don't see elements of comparison or future directions here. The emphasis is on the foundation and support provided by the cited work.
