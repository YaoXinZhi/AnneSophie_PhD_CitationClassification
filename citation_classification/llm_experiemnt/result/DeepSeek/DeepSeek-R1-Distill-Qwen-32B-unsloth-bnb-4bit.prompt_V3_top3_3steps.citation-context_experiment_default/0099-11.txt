Okay, so I'm trying to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage into the top three rhetorical classes. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage says: "In our study, we observed that parasitic wasps showed a preference for plants infected with a particular strain of the bacterium Xylella fastidiosa @@CITATION@@. This finding aligns with the broader ecological principle that parasitoids are more attracted to host plants that are under stress."

Looking at this, the citation is right after mentioning their observation about parasitic wasps preferring infected plants. The next sentence explains that this aligns with a broader ecological principle.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The sentence after the citation is a general statement that links their specific finding to a larger principle. So, the citation is supporting their observation by connecting it to existing ecological principles. This seems like a supportive intent because they're backing up their result with a cited principle.

Step 3: Assign specific classes. The primary class here is Support because they're using the citation to back their finding. Since it's aligning with a principle, there's also a bit of Similar, as it's similar to established patterns. It doesn't directly compare methods or results, nor does it discuss future directions or weaknesses. So, the top three would be Support, Similar, and maybe Neutral if it's just a descriptive reference without much comparison.

Wait, but actually, since there's a direct alignment with a broader principle, it's more about supporting their finding than just being similar. So maybe Neutral is less likely. Alternatively, if it's aligning with a principle, it's more of a Support than Similar. Hmm. Alternatively, the use could be a Motivation if it's explaining why the study was done, but in this case, it's supporting their result. So the order would be Support first, then perhaps Neutral if it's just providing context, but I think Similar might still come in as they're pointing out a similarity with existing principles. But maybe Neutral isn't the best fit here. Alternatively, it could be CoCoRes if they're comparing results, but they're not necessarily contrasting results. They're showing consistency, so Support makes the most sense.

1. Support  
2. Similar  
3. Neutral
