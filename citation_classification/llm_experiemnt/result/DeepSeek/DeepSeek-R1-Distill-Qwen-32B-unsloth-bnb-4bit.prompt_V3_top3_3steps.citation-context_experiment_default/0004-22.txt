Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given plant health domain passage. Let me see.

First, I need to extract the context surrounding @@CITATION@@. Looking at the passage, it says something like, "Previous studies have shown that certain methods are effective in controlling plant diseases. For example, the use of resistant varieties has been a common approach @@CITATION@@." Hmm, so the citation is part of a discussion about methods used to control plant diseases, specifically mentioning resistant varieties.

Next, I need to identify the general intent of the citation. The passage is supporting the argument that resistant varieties are a common method. The citation is used to back up this claim, indicating that it's providing evidence or confirming the effectiveness of resistant varieties.

Now, mapping this to the predefined rhetorical classes. The citation is supporting the current paper's point, so 'Support' seems appropriate. It's not comparing different studies, so CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY might not fit here. There's no indication of motivating further research, so Future is out. It's not describing a method used (Usage) or pointing out a weakness.

So, the main class is Support. For the next two, perhaps 'Usage' could be considered if the citation details the methods used, but it's more about confirming the effectiveness rather than the method itself. 'Neutral' might be another option if the citation is just stating a fact without supporting the argument, but in this case, it's clearly supporting. Maybe 'Neutral' isn't the best fit here.

Wait, maybe 'Similar' could be applicable if it's showing that other studies also found the same results, similar to the current study. But the citation is more about supporting the current approach rather than showing similarity in findings across studies. So, 'Support' is definitely first. Then, perhaps 'Neutral' as a secondary, but I'm not sure. Another thought: maybe 'Basis' if the citation is foundational to the current study's method, but the example doesn't indicate that it's the basis of their research.

Alternatively, if the citation is just presenting a fact without supporting or arguing, it could be 'Neutral'. But in this context, the citation is used to support the argument about resistance. So, maybe the next class is 'Support' again, but we can only choose three. Hmm, perhaps 'Neutral' is the third after 'Support' and another. Alternatively, 'Basis' if the cited work is a foundational study that the current work builds upon.

Wait, in the example, the citation is part of the supporting evidence. So, 'Support' is primary. Then, maybe 'Basis' if the cited work is key to their approach, or 'CoCoGM' if they're comparing methods. But the passage doesn't explicitly compare methods, just states that resistant varieties are a common approach, citing the work.

I think the top three are:
1. Support
2. Basis
3. Neutral

1. Support  
2. Basis  
3. Neutral
