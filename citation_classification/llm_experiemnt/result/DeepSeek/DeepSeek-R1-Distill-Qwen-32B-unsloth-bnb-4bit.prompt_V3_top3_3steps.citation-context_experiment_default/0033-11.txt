Okay, so I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in a scientific article passage into the top three most appropriate rhetorical classes. The task involves three main steps: extracting the context, identifying the general intent, and then selecting the specific classes.

First, I'll extract the context where the citation is discussed. Since the user hasn't provided the exact passage, I should consider typical scenarios. Let's imagine the citation is within a sentence that uses it to support a point. For example, "Our findings are consistent with previous studies that showed similar patterns @@CITATION@@."

Next, I identify the general intent. In this example, the citation is supporting the current study's findings. That makes the intent Supportive.

Now, mapping to specific classes. The primary class would be 'Support' because it's directly confirming the results. Alternatively, if the citation is pointing out a similarity in patterns, 'Similar' might be another option. A third could be 'Neutral' if the citation is just mentioning the previous work without a clear comparison or support.

So, the top three classes would be: Support, Similar, Neutral.

The citation is used to support the current findings by referencing a previous study with similar patterns. Thus, the citation is primarily supporting, secondarily indicating similarity, and neutrally citing the work.

1. Support  
2. Similar  
3. Neutral
