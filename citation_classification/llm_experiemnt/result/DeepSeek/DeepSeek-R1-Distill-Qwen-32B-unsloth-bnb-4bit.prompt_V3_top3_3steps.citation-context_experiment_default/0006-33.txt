Okay, I'm looking at the task where I need to classify a citation @@CITATION@@ from a scientific passage into the top three rhetorical classes. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I extract the context around the citation. The sentence mentions that a study found aphid species diversity significantly reduced in grasslands. The citation is used in a sentence that also states other studies' findings. 

Next, I consider the general intent. Since the citation is part of multiple studies showing similar reductions in diversity, it seems to provide support for the current paper's findings.

Now, assigning the classes. The primary class is Support because the citation directly backs up the argument. Then, Neutral might fit if the citation is used descriptively without explicitly supporting. Lastly, there's a touch of Similar since other studies are being mentioned.

So, the top three are Support, Neutral, and Similar.

1. Support  
2. Neutral  
3. Similar
