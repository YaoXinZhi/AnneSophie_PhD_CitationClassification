Okay, so I need to assign the top three rhetorical classes to the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage about plant health. Let me try to understand the context and the role of the citation.

First, I'll look at the step-by-step process. Step 1 is to extract the context discussing the citation. The passage says: "In their study, Smith et al. (2020) found that fungal infections significantly reduce crop yields in temperate regions. Building on this, our research expands the scope to tropical regions while maintaining similar experimental setups @@CITATION@@."

So the context mentions that Smith et al.'s study shows fungal infections reduce crop yields, and the current research expands on this by looking at tropical regions and keeping similar experimental setups.

Step 2 is to identify the general intent. The citation is being used to indicate that the current research builds upon previous work. That suggests it's foundational because it supports the rationale for the current study. So the general intent might be Foundational, which corresponds to Basis.

Next, for Step 3, I need to find the top three specific rhetorical classes. Basis seems appropriate because it's referencing foundational work. Then, the citation is being used to show that the current study builds on it, which could also be Similar since the setup is similar. Additionally, since it's expanding the scope from temperate to tropical regions, this might involve a comparison of contexts, possibly CoCoXY if they are contrasting their findings with another study elsewhere. Alternatively, it could be Motivation if the citation is used to justify why the current research is needed.

Looking back, the passage explicitly mentions "Building on this," which points to the research being built upon the cited work. So Basis fits as it's the foundation. Next, they mention maintaining similar experimental setups, which shows similarity in methods, so Similar is applicable. They might also be subtly comparing their results, so CoCoRes could be a consideration.

Wait, but the passage doesn't explicitly compare results, just the setup. Therefore, the most accurate might be Basis first, then Similar, then CoCoRes if considering future implications.

Alternatively, the citation might be used to set the stage for the current research, which is foundational and similar in setup, with a possible motivation to extend the scope.

So, the top three could be:

1. Basis
2. Similar
3. Motivation

1. Basis  
2. Similar  
3. Motivation
