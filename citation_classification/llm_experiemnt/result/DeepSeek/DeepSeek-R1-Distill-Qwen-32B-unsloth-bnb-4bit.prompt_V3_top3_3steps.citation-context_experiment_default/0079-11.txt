Okay, I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context into three top rhetorical classes. Let's start by understanding the context.

The passage says: "Previous studies have shown that magnetic treatment can prevent the formation of hard calcite scale on surfaces exposed to hard water @@CITATION@@." 

Step 1: Extract the context. The context mentions that previous studies have found magnetic treatment prevents scale formation, citing @@CITATION@@. 

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation is used to justify the current research's motivation, as it identifies a finding that leads to the current study's purpose. So the intent is Motivational.

Now, mapping to rhetorical classes:

1. Motivation: Because it's justifying the research's purpose. 
2. Support: It also supports the current work's premise, so it could be Support as secondary. 
3. Basis: It provides foundational information, making it third.

Other classes like CoCoGM, CoCoRes, etc., don't fit here since it's not comparing methods or results. It's not a technical usage, nor a neutral mention or a weakness.

The citation is used to justify the current research, supporting its premise with foundational information.

1. Motivation  
2. Support  
3. Basis  

Final JSON output:
