Alright, I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context into the top three rhetorical classes. First, I'll extract the context discussing the citation. The passage mentions that the citation is about fast multiplication rates and high concentrations of two strains of a phytoplasma in young leaves and roots. It also states that conflicting results were described for another phytoplasma. 

From this, the general intent seems to be a comparison of results or findings. The citation is pointing out that while some studies report high concentrations, others have conflicting results, which indicates a comparison between results. 

Looking at the predefined classes, CoCoRes fits because it's about comparing results. Since the comparison is between two studies cited, CoCoXY also applies as it compares explanations or claims. The passage doesn't mention motivation, future research, or directly support the current work, so the next appropriate is Neutral, as it's a descriptive note about conflicting findings without additional context.

1. CoCoRes  
2. CoCoXY  
3. Neutral
