Alright, I'm trying to determine the correct rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@. First, I need to extract the context where this citation is used. The example given is "Our previous research @@CITATION@@ has shown that the formation of the hard calcite scale on the surfaces exposed to hard water can be successfully prevented with the applied magnetic field." This suggests that the citation is referring to past work the authors did.

Next, I'll identify the general intent. The authors are using this citation to justify why they're conducting their current research. They mention that the previous work demonstrated a successful prevention method, but the mechanism isn't explained. So, their current work aims to understand this mechanism. This indicates that the citation serves as a motivation for their current study.

Now, mapping to the predefined classes: the general intent is Motivational. Looking at the specific classes under this category, I see that Motivation is likely the primary class. Since the citation is explaining the reason behind their current research by pointing out an existing finding, it also has elements of Similar, as the previous work supports their current motivation. Additionally, it might be considered as a Basis if it's setting the foundation, but the primary role here is motivational.

I don't see strong elements of comparison with other works or methods, so CoCoGM or CoCoRes don't fit here. There's no mention of future directions beyond the current study, so Future isn't applicable. The citation isn't criticizing or pointing out weaknesses, so Weakness isn't relevant. It's not a direct usage of a method or tool, nor is it a neutral mention. Therefore, the top three classes are Motivation, Similar, and maybe Weakness as a stretch, but Weakness isn't applicable here. Re-evaluating, Weakness isn't present, so I might consider Basis as a third option if Motivation is the top.

But since the primary intent is motivational, and it's similar in context, the third might not be necessary, but per instructions, I need three. So perhaps including Basis as third since it's foundational to the current work, even though Motivation is the main.

1. Motivation  
2. Similar  
3. Basis
