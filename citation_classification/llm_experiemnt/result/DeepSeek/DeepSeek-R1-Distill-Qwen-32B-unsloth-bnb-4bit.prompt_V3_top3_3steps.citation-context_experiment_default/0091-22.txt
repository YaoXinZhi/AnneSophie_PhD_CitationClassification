Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let's start by extracting the context surrounding the citation. The passage mentions that the citation reports the detection of a certain pathogen. 

Next, I'll identify the general intent. Since the citation is used to mention a finding or result, it seems to be supporting information. This supports the citing paper's findings by referencing another study.

Now, I need to determine the specific rhetorical classes. Support is the most appropriate because it directly confirms the finding. Neutral is next since the mention is factual without any comparison or critique. Usage might apply if the citation's method were used, but here it's just stating the result, so it's a bit less relevant. So, the top three are Support, Neutral, and Usage.

1. Support  
2. Neutral  
3. Usage
