Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to assign the correct rhetorical classes to the citation marked @@CITATION@@ in a scientific passage related to plant health. 

First, I'll extract the relevant context around the citation. The passage says: "The experimental setup used in this study is based on the methodology outlined by @@CITATION@@, which has been widely adopted in recent plant health studies. Our modifications to the setup are detailed in the following sections." 

Next, I need to identify the general intent of this citation. The sentence mentions that the experimental setup is based on the cited work and that this methodology has been widely adopted. They also detail their modifications, which implies they are using a method from the cited paper. 

Looking at the predefined classes, the most relevant one here is "Usage" because they're referencing the cited work's methodology as the basis for their own experimental setup. 

Another possible class is "Support," since they might be justifying their choice of methodology by referencing a well-established method. However, the primary intent is usage, not support per se. 

Lastly, "Neutral" could be considered, but since the citation is directly contributing to the current study's methods, it's more than just a neutral reference. 

So, I'll rank them as Usage first, then Support, and lastly Neutral.
</think>

The citation is referencing a methodology used in their study, which directly relates to the usage of a cited method.

1. Usage  
2. Support  
3. Neutral  

Step-by-step explanation:
1. **Usage**: The citation refers to a methodology used in the present study, indicating that it's directly utilized.
2. **Support**: The citation supports the methodology chosen, implying its acceptance and use in recent studies.
3. **Neutral**: While neutral, it's the least applicable since the focus is on the methodology's application.

#ANSWER

1. Usage  
2. Support  
3. Neutral
