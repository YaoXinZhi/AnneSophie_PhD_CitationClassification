Alright, I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage into the top three rhetorical classes. First, I'll extract the context around @@CITATION@@. The passage says that recent studies have found a phytoplasma strain causing stolbur disease, and they reference @@CITATION@@ to describe symptoms like yellowness and shoot dieback. 

Looking at the general intent, @@CITATION@@ is used to provide support for the cited findings, which aligns with a supportive intent. The specific class here is Support. Next, the passage is discussing similar symptoms across different studies, so Similar is the second class. Lastly, the citation could be seen as a neutral mention in the context of presenting information without necessarily supporting or comparing further, making Neutral the third class.

1. Support  
2. Similar  
3. Neutral
