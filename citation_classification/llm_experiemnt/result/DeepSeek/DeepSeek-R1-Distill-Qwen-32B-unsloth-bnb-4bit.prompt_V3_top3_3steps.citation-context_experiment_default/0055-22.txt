Alright, I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. The first step is to extract the context around the citation to understand its intent.

Looking at the passage, it says: "The study examined the effects of magnetic fields on plant health, building on earlier findings by @@CITATION@@, which showed a 20% increase in crop yields under similar conditions." 

So, the citation is referencing a prior study that demonstrated increased crop yields, and the current study is building upon that. This suggests that the cited work provides a foundational basis for the current research. The intent is to establish the intellectual foundation by referencing prior work that supports the current study's premise.

Next, considering the general intent, it seems to be foundational, which aligns with the Basis class. 

Now, assigning the top three rhetorical classes. The primary class is Basis because the cited work is setting the foundation. Since the current study is building upon it, it's using the citation to justify the research motivation, so Motivation is also relevant. Additionally, the cited work's results are being used to support the current study's approach, which touches on Support.

So, ranking them: 
1. Basis as it's directly foundational.
2. Motivation because it's justifying why the study is conducted.
3. Support as the cited results back the current approach.

1. Basis  
2. Motivation  
3. Support
