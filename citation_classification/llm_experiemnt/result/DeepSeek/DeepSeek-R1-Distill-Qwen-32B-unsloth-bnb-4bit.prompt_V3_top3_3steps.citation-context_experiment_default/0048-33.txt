Okay, I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me start by understanding the task. I have to extract the relevant context, determine the general intent, and then assign the top three rhetorical classes from the predefined list.

First, I look at the context provided: "The experimental setup for this study was based on that described by @@CITATION@@." This sentence indicates that the current study's setup was borrowed from the cited work. 

Next, I identify the general intent. Here, the citation is pointing out that a method or setup from the cited work was used. This falls under the 'Usage' category since it's about using a specific method from another study.

Now, I need to rank the top three rhetorical classes. The primary choice is 'Usage' because the context directly mentions using the setup. Then, considering the predefined categories, I think 'Support' might be secondary because the cited work supports the current study's methodology. Lastly, 'Basis' could be third since the setup provides foundational support, though it's more about usage than the intellectual foundation.

So, the top three classes are:
1. Usage
2. Support
3. Basis

1. Usage  
2. Support  
3. Basis
