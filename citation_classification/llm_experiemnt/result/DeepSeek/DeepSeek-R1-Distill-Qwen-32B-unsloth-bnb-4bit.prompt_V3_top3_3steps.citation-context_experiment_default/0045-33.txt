Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in this plant health context. Let me go through the steps.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the experimental setup is described in detail. The authors are referring to a previous study where the setup was already detailed. 

Next, I have to identify the general intent. Since they're pointing out that they've used an existing setup, this seems like they're using a method or tool from a previous work. That makes me think it's about usage.

Looking at the classes, 'Usage' seems right because they're referencing someone else's method. The other options like Support or Similar don't fit because they aren't comparing or supporting their results with this. It's purely about using a setup from another source.

1. Usage  
2. Neutral  
3. Basis
