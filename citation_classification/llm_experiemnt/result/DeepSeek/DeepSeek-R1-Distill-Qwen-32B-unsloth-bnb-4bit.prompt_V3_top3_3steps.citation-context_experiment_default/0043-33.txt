Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to identify the citation in the given passage. The user mentioned @@CITATION@@, so I'll assume that's the citation we're focusing on. 

Next, I'll extract the context around @@CITATION@@. Let's say the passage is something like: "Previous studies have shown conflicting results on the effectiveness of magnetic water treatment devices @@CITATION@@."

Step two is to determine the general intent of the citation. The sentence mentions conflicting results, which suggests the authors are comparing or contrasting findings from different studies, including the cited one.

Moving to step three, I need to assign the top three rhetorical classes. The primary class seems like CoCoRes, as they're comparing results. CoCoXY is also relevant because they're discussing conflicting claims between studies. Neutral might apply if the citation is just stating facts without explicitly supporting or opposing a position.

1. CoCoRes  
2. CoCoXY  
3. Neutral
