Alright, I'm trying to figure out the top three rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. The passage says that "In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@@."

First, I need to extract the context. The sentence discusses a study where the arthropod host influenced bacterial assemblages, mentioning both the host and environmental factors. The citation is tagged here, so the context is about supporting findings with prior research.

Next, identifying the general intent. The cited work provides similar findings or patterns, so it's likely supportive. Looking at the predefined classes, 'Similar' seems appropriate because it's pointing out a similarity in results. 

Then, I consider if there's any comparison. The citation isn't comparing the current study's methods or results directly but rather supporting the current finding. So 'Support' is another possible class. However, the example given for 'Similar' matches this case exactly, where another study's findings are cited to back up the current result.

Lastly, 'Neutral' could be a third option because sometimes a citation is just provided without any explicit comparison or support. But since the citation is clearly supporting the finding, 'Neutral' is less likely but still a possible fallback.

So, the top three classes would be 'Similar' as the primary, followed by 'Support', and then 'Neutral' if needed.

1. Similar
2. Support
3. Neutral

1. Similar  
2. Support  
3. Neutral
