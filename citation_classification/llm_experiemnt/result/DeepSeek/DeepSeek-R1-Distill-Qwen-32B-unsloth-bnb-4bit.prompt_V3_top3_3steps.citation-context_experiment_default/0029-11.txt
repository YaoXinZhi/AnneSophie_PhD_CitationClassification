Alright, I'm trying to figure out the right rhetorical classes for the citation marked @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific passage. The user has provided a task to extract the context, identify the general intent, and then assign the top three rhetorical classes.

First, I need to look at the example provided to understand the context. The passage says that the formation of the hard calcite scale can be successfully prevented with a magnetic field, but no explanation was offered. The current work aims to understand the mechanism. The citation is mentioned as "Our previous research @@CITATION@@ has shown that the formation...can be successfully prevented."

Looking at this, the citation is referring to their own previous work. The purpose is to establish that the magnetic field prevents scale formation, which is the foundation for their current research on understanding the mechanism. This seems to be setting the stage for their new study, indicating it's foundational.

Now, considering the rhetorical classes:
- Basis: As it refers to their prior work, it provides the intellectual foundation for their current research.
- Motivation: The citation is used to justify why they're conducting this new study, pointing out the gap in understanding the mechanism.
- Support: The previous finding supports their current work by confirming that the magnetic field works.

So, the primary class is Basis, followed by Motivation. Support is third because it's more about backing their approach but not the main intent.

1. Basis  
2. Motivation  
3. Support
