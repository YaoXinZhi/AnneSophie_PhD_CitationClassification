Okay, I'm presented with a task to classify a citation in a scientific article passage into three rhetorical classes. The user has provided an example of how they want the response to look. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand the context. The citation is marked @@CITATION@@ and I have to focus on that specific part of the passage. I should extract the surrounding text to understand the intent of the citation. The passage is about plant health, so the context might involve studies on plant diseases, treatments, or findings.

Next, I need to identify the general intent of the citation. There are several categories like Foundational, Comparative, Motivational, Supportive, Technical, Critical/Analytical, and Descriptive. Each of these corresponds to specific rhetorical classes. For example, Foundational might map to Basis, while Supportive could be Support or Similar.

In the example provided, the output is a list of rhetorical classes ranked from 1 to 3. The user's sample shows how each class is determined based on how the citation is used in the passage. So, I need to find three classes that best fit the citation's use in the context.

I'll start by looking at the definitions again. Let's say the citation is used to compare two studies concerning their results. That would likely be CoCoRes. If it's pointing out a similarity without necessarily comparing, then Similar might be the next. If it's just a neutral mention without any support or criticism, Neutral would follow.

Putting it together, I'd need to analyze the specific passage where the citation is used. Since I don't have the actual passage, I'll assume based on how the classes are defined and the examples given. In the example, the output is CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Neutral. So, if the citation is comparing two studies' results, the top class would be CoCoRes. If it's comparing explanations, then CoCoXY. If it's a neutral mention, it's last.

I should ensure that I only output the top three classes and strictly follow the format without any extra text. So, after my reasoning, I'll present the three classes in order, each on a new line.

I think I've got the process down. Now, I'll apply this to the given passage.

1. CoCoRes  
2. CoCoXY  
3. Neutral
