Alright, I'm trying to classify the context given the citation @@CITATION@@ in the passage. First, I need to extract the context discussing this citation. The passage says, "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." This indicates that the citation is referring to a previous work where the experimental setup was detailed.

Next, I need to identify the general intent of the citation. In this case, the authors are referencing a prior study for the setup they used. This suggests that they're using the citation to reference a method or tool from a previous work that they directly employed in their current study.

Looking at the predefined rhetorical classes, the most appropriate category here is "Usage" since they're referring to a method/tool used in their current study. There's no comparison (CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY), motivation, future direction, support, similarity, weakness, or neutrality involved here. The authors are simply citing where their setup was previously detailed.

So, my reasoning leads me to categorize this citation under Usage.

1. Usage  
2. Neutral  
3. Basis
