Alright, let me try to break this down step by step. I'm going to follow the provided instructions and use the examples to classify the citation correctly.

First, I need to extract the context around @@CITATION@@. Looking back, the passage discusses how the formation of hard calcite scale was prevented with a magnetic field in previous research, and the current study aims to understand the mechanism. The citation is used here to justify the current research by highlighting that the explanation wasn't available before.

Next, I need to determine the general intent. Since the citation is explaining why this research is being done by pointing out an open question, the intent is motivational. This aligns with the Motivation category because it identifies a knowledge gap.

Now, classifying into the predefined categories: Motivation is the most appropriate because it's directly about why the research is necessary. The other possible options could be Similar or Support, but the citation isn't comparing or supporting; it's setting the stage for the research.

So, the top three classes would be Motivation as the best fit, followed by Similar and Support as less likely but still possible interpretations.

1. Motivation  
2. Similar  
3. Support
