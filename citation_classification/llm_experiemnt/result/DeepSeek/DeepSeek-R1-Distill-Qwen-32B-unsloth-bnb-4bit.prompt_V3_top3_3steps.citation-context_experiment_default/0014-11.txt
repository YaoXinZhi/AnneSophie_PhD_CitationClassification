Okay, I'm presented with a scientific passage and need to classify the citation marked @@CITATION@@ into the top three rhetorical classes. The predefined classes are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Motivation, Future, Support, Similar, Usage, Weakness, and Neutral. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. Let me look at the passage where @@CITATION@@ is mentioned. It says, "In this section, we expand on the previous work by @@CITATION@@, where the authors identified the primary factors influencing plant disease progression. Our study builds upon their findings to explore additional parameters." 

From this, the citation is mentioned in the context of expanding on previous work. The authors are referring to a prior study that identified primary factors and mention that their work builds upon those findings. 

Next, I need to determine the general intent. The citation is being used to establish a foundation for their current research. They are pointing out that their work is an extension or building upon the cited study. 

Looking at the predefined classes, Basis fits because it shows the intellectual foundation. Then, CoCoGM might be considered if they are comparing methods or goals, but here it's more about building on rather than comparing. Support is another option since they are supporting their work by referencing prior findings. However, the primary intent is foundational.

So, the top three are Basis, Support, and maybe Neutral if it were just descriptive, but since it's used to build upon, Support is more fitting. Therefore, I rank them as Basis, Support, and Neutral as a lesser fit.

1. Basis  
2. Support  
3. Neutral
