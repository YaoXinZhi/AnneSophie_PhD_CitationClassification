Okay, so I'm trying to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in this scientific passage. Let's go through the steps.

First, I need to extract the context. Looking at the passage, it mentions that previous studies have found fast multiplication rates and conflicting results for different phytoplasma strains in certain plants. The citation is used to highlight these conflicting results.

Next, identifying the general intent. Since the citation is pointing out conflicting results between studies, this seems to be a comparison between two cited studies. So it's a comparative intent.

Now, mapping this to the rhetorical classes. The finest-grained would be CoCoXY because it's comparing explanations or claims from two studies. Then, Support is also relevant because it's using previous findings to back up the current discussion, even though it's a comparison. Finally, Neutral is a possibility because the citation is presented neutrally without necessarily supporting or opposing a立场. But between the options, CoCoXY is the most accurate, followed by Support, and then Neutral as the least but still somewhat applicable.

So the top three classes would be CoCoXY, Support, and Neutral.

1. CoCoXY  
2. Support  
3. Neutral
