Okay, I need to figure out how to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. First, I'll extract the relevant context around the citation. The passage mentions that the authors used a method from the cited work without introducing any modifications. 

Step 2: The general intent here seems to be using prior work for their methodology. Since they're directly referencing how they applied the method without changes, this is about using a tool or framework from the cited study.

Step 3: The most fitting class is Usage because they're using a method from the cited work. There's no comparison or support needed, just straightforward application. The other classes like Basis or Support don't fit as well because it's not about the foundation or confirming results.

1. Usage  
2. Neutral  
3. Basis
