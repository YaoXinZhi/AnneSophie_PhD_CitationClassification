Okay, so I need to extract the context discussing the citation @@CITATION@@. Let me read through the passage again to find where the citation is mentioned. It says, "In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@@." 

Now, looking at the context, the citation is referencing a previous study that investigated how arthropod hosts influence bacterial communities. The authors are supporting their findings by pointing out that another study found similar results. 

The general intent here seems to be supporting their work. They're using the citation to back up their own results, which suggests the citation is being used for support. 

Looking at the predefined classes, "Support" is directly about citing work that confirms their findings. Another possible class is "Similar," since the cited work's findings align with theirs. There's also a slight comparison element, but it's more about similarity than contrasting results. "Neutral" might be a third option since the citation could just be providing a reference without any specific argumentative use beyond support.

So the top three classes should be Support, Similar, and Neutral.

1. Support  
2. Similar  
3. Neutral
