Okay, so I have to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the passage about plant health. Let's start by extracting the context. The passage mentions the study of fast multiplication rates and conflicting results described by previous researchers. It's about strains of 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' in daisy plants and conflicting findings in another study.

Looking at the general intent, the citation is comparing results between studies, not the current paper. So it's a comparative intent. Specifically, it's comparing two studies with conflicting results. So this falls under CoCoXY, which compares explanations or claims between two studies.

Next, I need to rank the top three rhetorical classes. CoCoXY is clearly the first because it's directly comparing two studies' findings. CoCoRes is next because it deals with comparing results, even though it's a subcategory. Then, Neutral could be third because the citation is just stating the information without further comparison.

1. CoCoXY  
2. CoCoRes  
3. Neutral
