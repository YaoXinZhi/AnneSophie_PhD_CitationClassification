Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the provided passage. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage says that the citation "has shown that the formation of the hard calcite scale on the surfaces exposed to hard water can be successfully prevented with the applied magnetic field." This part mentions previous research and the results.

Next, I have to determine the general intent. The citation is used to explain that their previous research showed a prevention method, and now they're trying to understand the mechanism. This seems to be justifying why they're conducting the current research because there's a knowledge gapâ€”specifically, no explanation yet. So, the intent is Motivational.

Now, for the specific rhetorical classes. The citation is supporting the current study by showing a successful prevention method, so Support is appropriate. It's also pointing out a similarity because it's consistent with previous research, so Similar is another fit. Usage isn't quite right because it's not about a method being used but a result being referenced. Motivation is a primary class here, so it should rank highest, followed by Support and then Similar.

1. Motivation  
2. Support  
3. Similar
