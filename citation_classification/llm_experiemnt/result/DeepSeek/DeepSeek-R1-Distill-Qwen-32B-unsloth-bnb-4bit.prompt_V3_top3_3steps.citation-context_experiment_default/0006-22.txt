Okay, I need to classify the citation marked @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let's follow the steps as outlined.

First, I'll extract the context around @@CITATION@@. The passage mentions that the citation describes how a small peptide interferes with virus uptake in aphids and binds to other aphid species. So, the context is about a specific function of the peptide and its applicability beyond one species.

Next, I need to identify the general intent. The citation is supporting the broader applicability of the peptide. The authors are using it to confirm that their peptide's effect isn't just limited to one species, which is in support of their findings.

Now, looking at the rhetorical classes, this seems to be a Support category because the citation is backing up the authors' observation about the peptide's effectiveness across different aphid species. There's no comparison with another study, just confirmation of their results.

The other possible classes could be Similar if they were pointing out a similarity, but it's more about supporting the applicability. So the top three would be Support as the primary, then maybe Motivation if it's showing a need, but that's less relevant here. Weakness isn't applicable because there's no criticism. So the main classes are Support, then perhaps Neutral if it were a simple statement, but since it's used for support, it's more about that.

Therefore, the top three classes are Support, Similar (maybe they're similar findings), and Neutral. 

Wait, wait, noâ€”Support is the primary because it's confirming their result. If it's not explicitly stating a similarity but just supporting the idea, then maybe the next is Neutral, but I think Support is clear here.

1. Support  
2. Similar  
3. Neutral
