Alright, I need to analyze the given passage and the citation @@CITATION@@ to determine the top three rhetorical classes. 

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that previous studies have shown how plant parasitic nematodes are affected by rhizobacteria, specifically in reducing nematode populations in various crops. This sets up a comparison between the cited works and the current study.

The general intent here seems to be comparative. The authors are discussing how their current study builds on existing research to show a similar pattern. They're not directly replicating the studies but rather using them to highlight that their findings align with what's been observed in other crops.

So, the top rhetorical class is Support, because they're confirming their results with prior studies. Next, Similar makes sense because they are pointing out that their findings are in line with those of others. Lastly, the citation could also serve as a Basis, laying the groundwork for their research.

1. Support  
2. Similar  
3. Basis
