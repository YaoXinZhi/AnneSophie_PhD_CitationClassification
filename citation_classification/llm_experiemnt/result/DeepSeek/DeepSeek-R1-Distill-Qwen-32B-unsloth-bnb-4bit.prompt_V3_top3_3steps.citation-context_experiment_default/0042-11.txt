Okay, I'm trying to determine the rhetorical classes for the citation marked @@CITATION@@ in the provided scientific passage about plant health. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage says: "Our finding... is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations... In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@@."

Looking at this, the authors are supporting their own findings by referencing another study. They mention that their results align with previous research in another contextâ€”specifically, cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. This indicates that the citation is used to confirm their results, which suggests the citation is in support of their work.

Next, for the general intent, it seems supportive because they're confirming their findings with another study's results. So, moving to the specific classes, Support is the primary one here. 

Additionally, the passage points out a similarity between their findings and the cited study. Both found that the host governs bacterial assemblages, regardless of the specific insect or environment. This similarity is another layer, so Similar would be the next class.

Although the citation is supporting, it's not foundational to their work, nor are they comparing methods or results directly. They're not highlighting a knowledge gap or future research direction either. So, the next appropriate class after Support and Similar might be Neutral, as it's a straightforward mention without any comparison or criticism.

So, the top three classes are Support, Similar, and Neutral.

1. Support  
2. Similar  
3. Neutral
