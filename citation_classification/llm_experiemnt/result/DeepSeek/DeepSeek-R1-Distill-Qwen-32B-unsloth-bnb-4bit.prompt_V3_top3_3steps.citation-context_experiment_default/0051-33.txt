Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific passage. Let's go through the process step by step.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The sentence is: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." Okay, this looks like the authors are referring to a prior study where they detailed their experimental setup.

Now, looking at the general intent. The authors are using the citation to reference a source that explains their setup. This seems technical because they're talking about a method or tool used in their study. From the predefined classes, that would be the 'Usage' category because they're referring to a method or tool from the cited work.

Next, I need to consider if there are other possible categories. The context is pretty straightforwardâ€” it's about a method being used, so 'Usage' fits well. I don't see any indication of comparison, motivation, or weakness here. The citation isn't used to compare results or methods, nor is it highlighting a gap or future work.

So, the top three rhetorical classes would primarily be 'Usage' since that's exactly what's happening. The other classes don't seem to apply as much. I don't think there's a need to list more than one category here because the context is specific.

1. Usage  
2. Neutral  
3. Support
