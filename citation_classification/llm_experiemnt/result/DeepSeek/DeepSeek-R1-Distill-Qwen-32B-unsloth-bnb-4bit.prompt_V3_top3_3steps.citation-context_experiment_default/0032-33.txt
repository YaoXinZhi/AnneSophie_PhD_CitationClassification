Alright, so I need to figure out the top three rhetorical classes for the citation marked @@CITATION@@ in the provided passage. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. Looking at the context, the passage states: "Our findings that insect hosts influence bacterial community assembly are supported by recent studies on other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the host was found to govern bacterial assemblages, unlike rodent hosts, which didn't have the same effect @@CITATION@@."

From this, it seems the authors are pointing out that their findings align with other studies. They mention that similar results have been observed in other insects, such as fleas and ticks. The citation is used to back up their own results by referring to previous work.

Next, identifying the general intent: The citation is clearly supporting the authors' findings. They're using it to confirm that their results are consistent with existing literature. This points towards a supportive intent.

Now, mapping this to specific rhetorical classes:

1. **Support**: The main intent here is to support the authors' findings by referencing another study that reported similar results. So, Support is the primary class.

2. **Similar**: Since the citation highlights that other studies have found similar effects, Similar is a good secondary class. The authors are pointing out that the phenomenon is consistent across different insects, which indicates similarity.

3. **Neutral**: While the citation is used supportively, it's not critical, motivational, or part of a comparison. In cases where the citation simply states a fact without any evaluative language, Neutral could be a third option. However, since the intent is clearly supportive, Neutral might not be the strongest here, but it's still relevant as it's a descriptive way of citing the source.

I don't think the citation is about motivation, future research, usage, or weakness since there's no mention of gaps, future directions, methods used, or criticisms. It's more about supporting their findings with similar evidence from other studies.
