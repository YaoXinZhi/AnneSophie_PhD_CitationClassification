Okay, I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the provided passage. Let me start by understanding the context. The passage discusses how the hard calcite scale on surfaces exposed to hard water can be prevented using a magnetic field. The authors reference their previous work (@@CITATION@@) to explain that while the prevention method is known, the mechanism isn't yet understood. They aim to explore this mechanism.

First, the general intent of the citation is motivational. They're citing their past work to justify the current research by pointing out that the mechanism isn't known. This fits under Motivation. 

Looking deeper, the citation isn't comparing anythingâ€”no methods, results, or other studies are discussed. It's more about setting the stage for their new research by identifying a gap. So, they don't use it for comparison (which would be CoCoGM, CoCoRes, etc.) or support (Support or Similar). They didn't use any specific tool or method from the cited work, so Usage isn't applicable. There's no criticism either, so Weakness is out.

Therefore, the top three classes should start with Motivation. Next, since they're introducing their research based on a gap, perhaps Support is the second, though it's more about justifying the study. Third might be Neutral, though it's less likely since the intent is clearly motivational.

Wait, maybe I should reevaluate. The primary intent is Motivation. But does it fit into any other classes? Since they're citing their own work to show that the prevention exists but the mechanism isn't known, it's more Motivation followed by maybe Support, as it's supporting their current study's relevance. Neutral might come third, but it's less relevant.

Alternatively, another perspective: they're using the citation to highlight a gap, which is purely Motivation. So maybe the top classes are Motivation, then possibly Support because it's building on their previous finding, and then Neutral as a third option if considering a more neutral use.

1. Motivation  
2. Support  
3. Neutral
