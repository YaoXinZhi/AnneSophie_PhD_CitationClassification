Okay, I need to analyze the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context to determine the most appropriate rhetorical classes. The passage talks about the study examining the role of environmental factors in plant pathogen development and mentions that the authors used a dataset from previous studies. 

Looking at the context, the citation is referring to the dataset used. The passage doesn't compare methods, results, or goals with other studies. It doesn't support or contradict their findings either. It's simply stating that they used a dataset from prior work. 

From the predefined classes, 'Usage' seems to fit because they are using a method or data from the cited work. There's no support or comparison involved, so other classes like Support or CoCoRes don't apply. 'Neutral' could also apply since it's a neutral mention without any comparison or motivation. However, 'Usage' is more specific. There's no motivation for conducting the research here either. 

So, the top three are Usage, Neutral, and then perhaps Weakness if there's an implication of data limitations, but the passage doesn't explicitly state any issues. Therefore, the top three would be Usage, Neutral, and then maybe Basis if the dataset is foundational, but that's stretching it. Alternatively, Neutral is second, and maybe Weakness is third.

1. Usage  
2. Neutral  
3. Weakness
