Okay, I need to figure out the top three rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the provided passage. Let me first understand the context. 

The passage mentions that "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." This indicates that the current study is referring back to a prior work where the setup was detailed. 

Looking at the definition of each class, Usage is when a citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or setup used in the current study. Here, the setup is directly referenced, so Usage fits. 

Next, there's no comparison being made, so CoCoGM, CoCoRes, or CoCoXY aren't relevant. The citation isn't providing motivation or suggesting future work either. It's purely a reference to a method used, without any critical analysis, support, or similarity highlighted. 

Therefore, the primary class is Usage. Since there's no comparison or additional support, the other two might be Neutral and perhaps Weakness if it's pointing out a flaw, but the passage doesn't indicate any criticism. So the secondary classes are Neutral and Weakness, even though the latter isn't clear here.

1. Usage  
2. Neutral  
3. Weakness
