Alright, I need to determine the top three rhetorical classes for the citation @CITATION@ in the given passage. Let me start by analyzing the context and intent of the citation.

First, I'll extract the context. The passage mentions that "Eighteen species, collected on cultivated and wild pear, were described from China @CITATION@. The taxonomic status of these species is problematic and some may not develop on Pyrus." The citation is made right after describing the species found in China, and the following sentence points out the problematic taxonomic status, suggesting some may not develop on Pyrus.

Next, I'll identify the general intent. The author is highlighting issues with the cited work, specifically questioning the taxonomic status and the validity of some species not developing on Pyrus. This indicates a critical or analytical intent towards the cited study.

Now, I'll map this to the predefined classes. The citation is pointing out limitations or flaws in the cited work, which aligns with the "Weakness" class. There's no comparison of methods, results, or other studies, so CoCoGM, CoCoRes, or CoCoXY don't fit here. The intent isn't motivational, future-oriented, supportive, similar, technical usage, or neutral. It's directly pointing out weaknesses in the cited research.

So, the top class is "Weakness." Since there's no other comparison or support mentioned, the other two classes are determined to be "Neutral," as the primary intent is critical, and there's no need for additional categories beyond that in this context.

1. Weakness  
2. Neutral  
3. Neutral
