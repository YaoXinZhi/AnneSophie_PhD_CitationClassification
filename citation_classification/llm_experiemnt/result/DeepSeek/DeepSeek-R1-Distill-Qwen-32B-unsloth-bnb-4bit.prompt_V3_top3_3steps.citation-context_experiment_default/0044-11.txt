Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let's see, step by step.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The context given is: "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@."

Now, I should identify the general intent of the citation. Looking at the sentence, it's stating a fact about the spread of magnetic water treatment devices in the USA without adding any additional context or comparison. It's just providing information about when and where these devices started being used.

Next, I need to determine the rhetorical class based on this. From the predefined list, I see that if the citation is used in a neutral, descriptive way without supporting, comparing, or critiquing, it falls under Neutral. The example given for Neutral is exactly this kind of situation: "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@."

So, the citation doesn't support or compare anything; it's just providing a factual statement. Therefore, the most appropriate class is Neutral. There are no other classes that fit here because it's not motivational, future-oriented, supportive, similar, or usage-based. It's purely descriptive.

1. Neutral  
2. Usage  
3. Support
