Alright, I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific article into the most appropriate rhetorical classes. First, I'll read the surrounding text to understand the context. The passage mentions conducting an experiment to examine plant stress responses. They specifically refer to using an experimental setup from a previous study (CITATION) and provide a brief overview of that setup. 

Step 1: The context is about using an experimental setup from another study for their current experiment. 

Step 2: The general intent seems to be referencing a method or tool used in a prior study, which is essential for their current research. This indicates usage.

Step 3: The top rhetorical class is Usage since they're directly using a method from the cited work. Next, since they're referencing foundational work, Basis is relevant. Finally, while not prominent, there's a slight descriptive element, so Neutral could be the third.

1. Usage  
2. Basis  
3. Neutral
