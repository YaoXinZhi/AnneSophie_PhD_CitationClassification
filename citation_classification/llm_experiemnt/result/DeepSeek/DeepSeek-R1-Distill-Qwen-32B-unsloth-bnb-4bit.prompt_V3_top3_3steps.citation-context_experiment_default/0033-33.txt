Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me go through the steps carefully. 

Step 1 is to extract the context. The passage says: "Our study builds upon previous findings by @@CITATION@@, which first demonstrated the effectiveness of magnetic fields in preventing hard water scaling." So the citation is mentioned in the context of building upon previous research.

Step 2 is to identify the general intent. Since the current study is using previous findings as a foundation, this seems to be Foundational. Foundational corresponds to the Basis class.

Looking at the predefined classes, Basis is for when a citation introduces or validates something that current research is based on. The example given is similar: introducing a concept and current work replicating it.

So for Step 3, the top class is definitely Basis. 

Now, are there other possible classes? Let's check. The citation isn't comparing anything else (so not CoCoGM, CoCoRes, etc.), isn't supporting or similar, doesn't mention weaknesses, isn't neutral, and isn't about usage. It's purely about establishing the foundation. So the only applicable class is Basis. Since I have to provide three, but only one is appropriate, I might have to list Neutral if needed, but the instructions say to assign the top three. I think in this case, the next could be Motivation, but it's not clear. Alternatively, maybe Neutral could be considered if the citation is just stated as a fact without any comparison or support. But the intent here is more clearly Foundational, so Basis is first, and the other two might not apply well. But I need to pick three. Alternatively, maybe Usage isn't applicable. Wait, the example for Basis says it's about intellectual foundation. So I'll stick with Basis as the only relevant class here and perhaps the next would be Neutral if forced, but I think that's stretching. Maybe just one class applies.

1. Basis  
2. Neutral  
3. Support
