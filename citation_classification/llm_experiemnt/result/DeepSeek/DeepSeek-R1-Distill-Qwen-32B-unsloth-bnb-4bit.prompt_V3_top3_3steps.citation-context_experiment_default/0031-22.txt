Okay, I need to classify the citation marked @@CITATION@@ in the given passage into the top three rhetorical classes. Let me go through each step carefully.

Step 1: Extract the context discussing the citation. The passage around @@CITATION@@ mentions that the taxonomic status is problematic and some species may not develop on Pyrus. So, the citation is highlighting that there are issues with the classification of these species.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The passage points out that the cited work's results are problematic or flawed. This suggests a critical or analytical intent because the authors are questioning the cited study's findings.

Step 3: Rank the rhetorical classes. Based on the intent, the most appropriate is Weakness since it's pointing out limitations. Comparatively, it's not a direct comparison of methods or results, so CoCoGM or CoCoRes aren't as fitting. It's not supporting or similar either. So the top three would be Weakness, followed perhaps by Neutral and then something else, but mainly Weakness is the primary class here.

I think I've got it. Now, to list the classes in order.

1. Weakness  
2. Neutral  
3. Basis
