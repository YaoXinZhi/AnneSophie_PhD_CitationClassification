Okay, so I need to determine the top three rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me follow the steps outlined.

First, I extract the context surrounding the citation. The passage says, "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@@."

The context here is about supporting the current study's findings with a cited work. The authors mention that their findings are "supported" by recent investigations, indicating a use of the citation to back up their results.

Next, I identify the general intent of the citation. Since it's used to support the authors' findings, the general intent is Supportive. This points towards the 'Support' class.

Now, I rank the top three rhetorical classes. The primary class here is 'Support' because the citation directly supports the current study's findings. The second could be 'CoCoRes' since it's comparing results between studies, though in this case, it's more about confirming rather than contrasting. Third, 'Similar' might be considered because the study discusses similar patterns of host influence. However, since the main function is support, 'CoCoRes' and 'Similar' are second and third.

Wait, but the example given under 'Support' matches this context closely. So, 'Support' is definitely the first. 'Similar' might fit because the findings are similar across different insect-associated bacteria. 'CoCoRes' less so, as it's more about direct comparison of results. Alternatively, 'Similar' could be second. Let me rethink.

Alternatively, the citation might be pointing out a similarity in findings, making 'Similar' a contender. 'Support' is still the primary. 'CoCoRes' is less applicable here because it's not directly comparing results but supporting them. 'Neutral' is not applicable because the citation is used for a specific purpose.

So, the top three would be:
1. Support
2. Similar
3. CoCoRes
</think>

1. Support  
2. Similar  
3. CoCoRes
