Okay, I need to determine the top three rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me break down the steps.

First, I'll extract the context surrounding the citation. The passage mentions "several studies @@CITATION@@ have reported...", which indicates the authors are citing prior research to support or confirm their own findings. 

Next, I'll identify the general intent. The citation is used to back up their results, so it's likely supportive rather than comparative or critical. 

Looking at the specific classes, "Support" fits because they're citing studies that align with their work. "Similar" also applies since the studies likely showed similar results. "Basis" isn't as direct because it's not establishing foundational research but supporting it.

So, the top three classes would be Support, Similar, and Neutral. Neutral because the citation doesn't show weakness or motivation but simply states the studies. 

Final ranks are:
1. Support
2. Similar
3. Neutral

1. Support  
2. Similar  
3. Neutral
