Okay, so I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in a scientific article passage related to plant health. First, I'll read the passage carefully to extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that recent studies have shown how plant viruses can influence their host plants' susceptibility to other pathogens. It then references @@CITATION@@ to back up that claim. This suggests that the citation is being used to support the information presented in the passage.

Looking at the predefined rhetorical classes, the most appropriate would be "Support" because the citation is directly backing up the statement about virus influence. It's not comparing results, methods, or goals, which would be CoCoRes or CoCoGM. There's no indication of motivation or future directions. The citation isn't pointing out a weakness or similarity, nor is it neutral. Therefore, the top class is Support.

Next, considering the next possible classes, "Similar" might be a consideration because the citation shows a similarity in findings regarding viral influence. However, the primary intent is support rather than just similarity. Still, Similar is a possible secondary choice. 

Lastly, "Neutral" could be the third option because if the citation were simply stating facts without explicitly supporting, but in this case, it's clearly used to support the argument. So, Support is first, then Similar, followed by Neutral.

Wait, but "Similar" might not be the best second choice. Since the passage is about supporting the claim, perhaps "Basis" could be considered if the citation provides foundational information, but in this case, it's more about support than establishing a basis. So, I'll stick with Support, then Similar, then Neutral.

1. Support  
2. Similar  
3. Neutral
