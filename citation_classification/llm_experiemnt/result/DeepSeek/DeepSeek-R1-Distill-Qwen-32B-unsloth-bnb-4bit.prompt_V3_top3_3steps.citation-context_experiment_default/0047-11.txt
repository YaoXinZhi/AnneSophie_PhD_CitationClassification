Okay, I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given plant health passage. Let's break it down step by step. 

First, extract the context. The passage talks about mycoplasma diversity and mentions a study from 2015 that found a high number of sequences using PCR. The authors state this is the first comprehensive study and refer to a specific survey in China.

Now, identify the general intent. The authors are comparing their study with the cited work. They mention the high sequence diversity and say theirs is the first comprehensive survey. So, they're pointing out a similarity in results but also highlighting their own contribution.

For the rhetorical classes, this seems to fall under Support because they're confirming the high diversity found earlier. It also touches on Similar since they're noting the similarity in results. It might also be Neutral as they're just describing another study's findings without necessarily comparing or contrasting their methods.

So, the top three classes would likely be Support, Similar, and Neutral.

1. Support  
2. Similar  
3. Neutral
