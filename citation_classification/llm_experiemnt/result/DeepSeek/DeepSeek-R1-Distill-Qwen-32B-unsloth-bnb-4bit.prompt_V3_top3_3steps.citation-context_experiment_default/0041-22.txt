Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, I should extract the context around the citation. Looking at the passage, the part before says "[CITATION]", but there's no specific text provided. Hmm, maybe I need to look at the surrounding sentences. The passage mentions that the reference is used to compare studies, but there's no explicit example here.

Next, I need to identify the general intent. From the context, it seems the citation is used to discuss conflicting results, like how two studies reported different findings. That suggests it's a comparative intent.

Now, looking at the predefined classes, I should categorize this. Comparing results would fall under CoCoRes. But wait, since it's comparing two cited studies, not with the citing paper, maybe it's CoCoXY? Or is it both? Let me check the examples.

CoCoRes is when comparing with the citing paperâ€™s results. CoCoXY is when comparing two cited works. Since the example mentions conflicting results between two studies, it's more like CoCoXY. But the initial context suggests comparison, which could be either between works or with the current study.

If the passage is about the citing paper's results compared to others, it's CoCoRes. If it's discussing two other studies, it's CoCoXY. Since the user's example uses CoCoRes and CoCoXY together, but here it's just comparing two studies, the primary is CoCoXY. But they might also be used to support the current study's approach, so Support or Basis could be secondary.

Alternatively, if the citation is used to back up the current findings by showing similar results, it's Support. But in this case, it's about conflicting results, so it's more critical or comparative.

I think the top is CoCoXY because it's comparing two cited studies. Next, maybe Neutral if it's just presenting information without supporting or opposing. But no, since it's pointing out a conflict, it's more of a critical comparison, so maybe Weakness. Wait, no, Weakness is when pointing out flaws, not just presenting conflicting findings.

Alternatively, if the purpose is to show that the cited works have conflicting results, and the current paper is using that to highlight the complexity, it might be Support as it's reinforcing the need for further research.

Hmm, I might have to list CoCoXY as 1, then Neutral as 2 if it's just stating facts, but maybe Basis if it's setting up the foundation for why the current study is needed. Or Support if it's backing up the current study's approach.

I think primarily, it's CoCoXY. Then, since it's setting the stage for the current research, Basis. Maybe Future as a third if it's suggesting where more work is needed.
