Okay, I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage into one of the specified rhetorical classes. First, I'll start by extracting the context around the citation. The passage mentions that "the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@." So, the citation is used to provide information about the spread of these devices in the USA starting from 1975.

Next, I'll determine the general intent. The citation is presenting a factual statement about the spread of magnetic water treatment devices without any comparison, support, motivation, or criticism. It's simply stating a trend observed in the USA.

Now, looking at the predefined classes, the context doesn't involve any comparison (so CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY aren't applicable), nor is it providing motivation, future direction, support, similarity, usage, or pointing out weakness. It's just a neutral statement citing when and where the devices became popular.

Therefore, the most appropriate class is Neutral. Since there are no other intents or comparisons, the other classes don't fit, so Neutral is the only suitable category here.
