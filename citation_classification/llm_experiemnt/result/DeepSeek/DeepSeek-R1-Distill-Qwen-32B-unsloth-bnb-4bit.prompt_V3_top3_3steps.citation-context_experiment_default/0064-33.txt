Alright, I'm trying to figure out the top three rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the provided passage. Let me follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Extract the context discussing the citation. The passage mentions that the authors conducted an experiment similar to the cited work but adjusted certain variables. This shows they're referencing a prior method or approach.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. Since they're using the citation to show how their methodology builds upon another's, it's likely to be related to a comparative or supportive intent. It's not foundational or motivational, nor directly critical. It's more about how their work relates to others' in terms of methods.

Step 3: Rank the specific classes. The primary class here seems to be Usage, as they are applying the cited work's methods. Then, CoCoGM as they adjust the variables, indicating a comparison of methods. Finally, Support, since they're using the cited work as a foundation for their approach even if adjusted.

Wait, maybe Support isn't the best since they're not confirming the cited work but using its methods. Alternatively, CoCoGM might be first because of the comparison of methods, with Usage second, and then possibly Neutral if it's just a mention without direct comparison.

Hmm, I think the top three are likely CoCoGM because they're adjusting variables from the cited study, then Usage as they're using that study's setup, and then Neutral if just a passing reference without deeper intent.

1. CoCoGM  
2. Usage  
3. Neutral
