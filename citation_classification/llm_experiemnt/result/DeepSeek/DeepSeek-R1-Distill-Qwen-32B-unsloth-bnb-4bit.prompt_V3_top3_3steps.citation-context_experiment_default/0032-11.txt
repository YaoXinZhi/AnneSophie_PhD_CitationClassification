Okay, let's tackle this problem. I need to determine the top three rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. 

First, I'll extract the context of the citation. The passage says: "Our previous research @@CITATION@@ has shown that the formation of the hard calcite scale on the surfaces exposed to hard water can be successfully prevented with the applied magnetic field. The explanation of the phenomena is not yet offered and the purpose of this work is to try to understand the mechanism of the beneficial influence of the magnetic treatment."

Looking at this, the citation is referencing previous research by the same authors. The general intent seems to be justifying why the current research is being done. They mention that their previous work showed a certain result, but an explanation is still needed. This points to a need for further investigation, which is a form of motivation.

Next, I'll map this to the predefined classes. The primary class here is Motivation because it's explaining the reason behind the current study. Support could be a contender since the previous work supports their current approach, but the main focus is on justification for the research, not just supporting findings. Neutral isn't applicable because the citation is used to motivate the study, not just describe it.

So, the top three classes are Motivation, then Support, followed by Neutral. Basis doesn't fit because it's not introducing a foundational concept but rather justifying the current work. Weakness or other comparison classes aren't relevant here.

1. Motivation  
2. Support  
3. Neutral
