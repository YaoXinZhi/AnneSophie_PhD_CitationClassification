Alright, I'm trying to figure out the top three rhetorical classes for the citation marked @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me go through it step by step.

First, I'll extract the context around @@CITATION@@. The passage says, "This builds on our previous work where we studied the molecular basis of disease resistance in rice using CRISPR-Cas9 technology @@CITATION@@." So the citation is referring back to a previous study done by the same authors or team.

Next, I need to identify the general intent. The citation here is used to establish a foundation for the current research. They're saying their current work builds on what they did before. So the general intent seems to be Foundational, which maps to the Basis class.

Now, I'll think about the specific rhetorical classes. Since it's a previous work setting the stage, Basis is definitely the first choice. Next, is there a comparison? Not really; they're just referencing their own work without contrasting or comparing it with others. So maybe CoCoGM isn't the best fit here. 

They aren't directly comparing results or explaining claims either, so CoCoRes or CoCoXY aren't applicable. Motivation is about justifying why the current research is done, which could be a stretch since they're referencing their own work as a foundation. But I think Basis is more accurate because it's about the intellectual foundation.

Wait, could it be Neutral? No, because they're using it to build on their previous research, not just mentioning it neutrally. So Neutral is probably not as strong.

Looking back, the top three should be Basis first. Then, since it's their own prior work, maybe Motivation could be considered as the reason for the current study. But I'm not sure if that's the main intent here.

Alternatively, maybe Usage isn't applicable because they aren't using a method from the cited work, just referencing the findings. So perhaps the third class could be Neutral, but that's a toss-up.

Hmm, to sum up, the primary class is definitely Basis. For second, Motivation could be considered because it's explaining why their current work is necessaryâ€”building on their prior research. Third might be Weakness if they're pointing out limitations in their prior work, but the passage doesn't mention that.

Wait, the example given for Basis fits perfectly here. So 1. Basis, 2. Motivation, 3. Neutral maybe.

But I'm not entirely sure about Neutral. Alternatively, if it's not setting the stage for future work, Future isn't applicable either. So I think the top three are:

1. Basis
2. Motivation
3. Neutral

Wait, but the example for Motivation is about a previous study that showed something, leading to the current work. So that does fit. So yes, I'll go with those.

1. Basis  
2. Motivation  
3. Neutral
