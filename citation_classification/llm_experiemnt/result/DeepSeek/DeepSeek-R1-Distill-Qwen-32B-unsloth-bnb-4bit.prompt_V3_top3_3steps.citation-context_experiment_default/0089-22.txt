Okay, so I need to figure out the top three rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me break down the process step by step.

First, I should look at the context provided. The passage says that the citation is used in a way that "the experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." The main point here is that the current study is using a method or setup that was previously detailed in the cited work. 

Next, I'll identify the general intent. Since the citation is referring to a method or setup used in the current study, that points towards a technical usage. The predefined list includes 'Usage' as a class which fits here. 

Now, looking at the specific definitions, 'Usage' is when a citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup from the cited work that is directly used. This seems to fit perfectly because the current study is using the experimental setup described in @@CITATION@@.

Are there other possible classes? Let me consider. Could it be 'Neutral'? It's providing a neutral fact without supporting or comparing. But since it's about using a method, 'Usage' is more specific. Maybe 'CoCoRes' or 'Support'? Not really, because it's not comparing results or supporting a finding, just referencing a method.

So, the top classes are clearly 'Usage' as the most appropriate. Since it's a direct use case, 'Neutral' might also apply in a broad sense, but 'Usage' is more precise. There's no comparison, motivation, or weakness involved here. Therefore, the next possible class, though less likely, might be 'Neutral' as a fallback, but it's not as strong as 'Usage'.

Step 1: The citation @@CITATION@@ is used to refer to an experimental set-up used in a previous study, indicating that the current work is building upon a method or setup from the cited work.

Step 2: The general intent is Technical, as the citation refers to a method or experimental setup that is directly used in the current study.

Step 3: The most appropriate rhetorical classes are:

1. Usage  
2. Neutral  
3. CoCoRes
