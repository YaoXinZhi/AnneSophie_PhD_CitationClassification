Okay, so I need to figure out the top three rhetorical classes for the citation marked @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. First, I'll look at the context around the citation to understand how it's being used.

The passage discusses the impact of magnetic fields on the growth of calcite scales on surfaces exposed to hard water. It mentions that previous research has shown prevention of scale formation but hasn't offered an explanation, so this study aims to explore the mechanism. The citation is part of the motivation for conducting this research.

Now, the general intent here seems to be motivational because the citation points out a gap in knowledge that the current study is addressing. So, I'm thinking this falls under the Motivation class.

Looking deeper, since the study is building on previous work and justifying why this research is necessary, it's definitelyMotivation. There's no comparison or support being given, just pointing out the need for further exploration based on prior results.

So, the top class is Motivation. The other possible classes don't fit as well. There's no comparison of results or methods, so CoCoRes or CoCoGM aren't applicable. It's not a usage of a method or dataset, so Usage is out. Similarly, there's no support or weakness mentioned about the cited work, so those are unlikely. The other classes like Basis or Future aren't fitting here either.

1. Motivation  
2. Basis  
3. Neutral
