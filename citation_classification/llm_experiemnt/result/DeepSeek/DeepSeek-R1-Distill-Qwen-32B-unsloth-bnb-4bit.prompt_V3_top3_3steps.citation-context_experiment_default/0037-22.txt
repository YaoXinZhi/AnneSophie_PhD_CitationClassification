Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the top three rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let's start by understanding the context and what each part means.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the citation is used in the conclusion and abstract of an article. The article's abstract explains that certain bacteria are influenced by the arthropod host rather than rodent hosts or environmental factors. The conclusion then points out that the current finding about insect hosts affecting bacterial assembly is supported by previous research on other insects like fleas and ticks, citing @@CITATION@@.

So the context is about supporting the current findings with earlier studies. The citation is presented as backing up the current research's conclusion. 

Next, I need to identify the general intent. The citation is used to confirm or corroborate the research findings, which falls into the supportive category. 

Now, I'll map this to the predefined rhetorical classes. The most appropriate class here is 'Support' because the citation directly confirms the current study's result. 

Looking at the other classes, 'Similar' might also fit because it's pointing out a similarity with previous findings. However, 'Support' is more precise. The third class could be 'Neutral' since the citation doesn't criticize or compare but simply states a fact from previous work.

So my top three are Support, Similar, Neutral.

1. Support  
2. Similar  
3. Neutral
