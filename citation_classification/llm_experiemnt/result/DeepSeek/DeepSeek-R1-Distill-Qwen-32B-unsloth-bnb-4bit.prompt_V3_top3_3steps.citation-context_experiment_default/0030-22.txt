Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me go through the steps as outlined.

First, I should extract the context around the citation. The provided passage is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@."

Looking at this, the context is talking about comparing results. The current work's results are different from the cited experiments. So the citation is being used to contrast their findings with those of the cited study.

Next, identifying the general intent. The citation is comparing results, so that points to a comparative intent. That would fall under 'Comparative' which includes CoCoGM, CoCoRes, or CoCoXY.

But wait, CoCoRes is specifically about comparing results. So this seems directly on point because the text says the results differ from the cited work's results. 

Is there a possibility of another class? Let me consider the options. The passage isn't comparing methods or goals, so it's not CoCoGM. It's not comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies, so CoCoXY doesn't apply here. It's directly comparing the results with the current work. 

So the primary class should be CoCoRes. Are there other plausible classes? The citation is used to contrast results, so maybe Neutral? But No, Neutral is for descriptive use without comparison. Here it's a specific comparison, so Neutral isn't the best fit. 

Could it also be Support? No, because they are differing, not supporting the cited results. What about Weakness? It's not pointing out a flaw in the cited work, just that the results differ. Therefore, Weakness doesn't fit here.

So the top three classes would be:

1. CoCoRes (since it's directly comparing results)
2. CoCoXY might come second if considering a broader comparison, but actually, the comparison is directly with the citing paper, not between two cited works, so CoCoXY isn't the best fit. Maybe Neutral could be second if considering a more general descriptive use, but since it's a comparison, Neutral is less likely. 

Wait, perhaps I was too quick to rule out Neutral. The citation could be neutrally stating that the results differ, but I think the primary intent is still CoCoRes. So the next options would be CoCoXY and Neutral, but since the comparison is with their own results, CoCoXY doesn't apply. 

So perhaps second is Neutral, then third might be CoCoGM if considering the methods, but the passage doesn't mention methods, only results. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a different interpretation. If the citation is only providing a reference point and not directly comparing, then Neutral could be the next. But the key is that the results differ, which is a comparison. So Neutral might be the second if considering a less direct use.

I'm a bit unsure about the second and third, but the first is definitely CoCoRes. Then, the next could be Neutral if we consider that it's providing context without necessarily intending to compare. But no, the context explicitly states that the results differ, so it's more of a comparison.

Wait, maybe I should think about whether the citation is used to set up a comparison or just to mention prior work. Since it's part of a sentence that compares their results to the cited ones, CoCoRes is definitely the main class. If someone had to pick second, perhaps CoCoXY if they were also comparing the cited study with another, but in this case, the passage only compares to the cited study, not between two others. So maybe second is Neutral, and third could be CoCoGM if methods were discussed, but they aren't.

Alternatively, perhaps the only applicable class is CoCoRes, with the others being less relevant. So, to list three, I might have to include the next possible ones, even if they are less fitting.

So in conclusion, the top three are CoCoRes, Neutral, and maybe CoCoXY if considering a broader comparison, but I'm not entirely sure.

1. CoCoRes  
2. Neutral  
3. CoCoXY  

# Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Extract the context: The citation is used in the context of comparing results, indicating that the current work's findings differ from the cited study's results.

2. General intent: The citation serves a comparative purpose, specifically comparing results.

3. Specific classes:
   - CoCoRes: Direct comparison of results.
   - Neutral: If considering the citation as merely providing context without comparison.
   - CoCoXY: Less fitting but possible if broader comparisons are considered, though less relevant here.
