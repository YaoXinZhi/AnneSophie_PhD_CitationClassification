Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. First, I need to extract the context around @@CITATION@@ to understand its intent. The passage mentions that the citation shows similar results in host-associated bacteria and mentions that the host governs bacterial assemblages without rodent or environmental factors. This suggests the citing paper is pointing out a similarity in findings with the cited work.

Next, I need to identify the general intent. The citation is supporting their own findings by referencing a previous study that shows the same pattern. The intent seems to be supportive, as they're backing up their results with similar evidence.

Now, looking at the specific rhetorical classes. The most appropriate would be "Similar" because they're highlighting a similarity in results. "Support" could also fit, but "Similar" is more precise. "Usage" might be a stretch if they used a method, but here it's more about the findings. So, top three are Similar, Support, and maybe Neutral, but Neutral doesn't fit as the citation is clearly in support.

1. Similar  
2. Support  
3. Neutral
