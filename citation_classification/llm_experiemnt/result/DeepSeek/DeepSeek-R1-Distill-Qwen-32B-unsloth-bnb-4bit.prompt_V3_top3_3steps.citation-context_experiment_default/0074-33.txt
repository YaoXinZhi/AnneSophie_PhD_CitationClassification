Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@. Let's go through the steps carefully.

First, I'll extract the context where the citation is mentioned. The passage says, "However, other studies have shown that the same species causes different symptoms in different hosts. For example, A. crown wilt was recorded in melon in Saudi Arabia @@CITATION@@. Similarly, A. leaf spot was reported in tomato in Pakistan @@CITATION@@."

From this, it looks like the citation is supporting the idea that the same fungal species causes different symptoms depending on the host. The author is referencing previous studies to back up this observation.

Next, I need to identify the general intent of the citation. It seems like the author is using the citation to confirm or support their point about symptom variation in different hosts. So, the intention is supportive.

Now, mapping this to the rhetorical classes, the most direct fit is 'Support' because the citation is confirming the cited work's findings. There's also a similarity in the findings, so 'Similar' could be another class. But 'Similar' is more about pointing out a similarity rather than directly supporting. 'Neutral' might apply if the citation is just stating a fact without supporting a point, but here it's clearly supporting. 'Usage' isn't applicable since it's not about methods or tools. 'Basis' is for foundational work, which isn't the case here. So the top three are Support, Similar, and Neutral.

1. Support  
2. Similar  
3. Neutral
