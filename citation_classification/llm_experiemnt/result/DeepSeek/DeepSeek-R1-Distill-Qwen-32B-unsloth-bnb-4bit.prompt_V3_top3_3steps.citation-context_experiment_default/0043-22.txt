Alright, I'm trying to figure out the appropriate rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me go through the steps methodically.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the citation is used to support the findings of the current study. It specifically states that all subscales were consistent with previous research, particularly the cited work, noting that participants didn't distinguish between personal interests and values as reasons for disputes, nor between competence and methods.

Next, I'll identify the general intent. The citation here is supporting the current results, so it's related to support.

Now, assigning the refined rhetorical classes. The primary class is Support because the citation is backing up the current findings. Another possible class is Similar, as it points out that the pattern is consistent with other studies. Lastly, Neutral could apply because the citation is presented in a descriptive way without further critique or comparison beyond supporting the current work.

So, the top three classes are Support, Similar, and Neutral.

1. Support  
2. Similar  
3. Neutral
