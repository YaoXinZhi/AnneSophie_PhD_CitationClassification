Okay, I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage into the top three rhetorical classes. Let's start by examining the context around the citation.

The passage mentions that the authors found a high correlation between the number of infected trees and the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 in adjacent populations. They then refer to other studies that have demonstrated a decrease in infection rates or improvement in the outcome of COVID-19 in areas with a higher density of green spaces.

Now, looking at the predefined classes:

1. **Support**: The citation supports the authors' findings by showing that other studies have observed similar effects of green spaces on COVID-19 outcomes. This seems to be the primary intent.

2. **Similar**: The cited studies are similar because they all look at the relationship between green spaces and disease outcomes, even though the specifics might differ slightly.

3. **Basis**: The cited studies could also serve as a foundation for the current research, providing the groundwork for their investigation.

Other classes like CoCoGM, CoCoRes, or Weakness don't seem to fit here because the passage isn't comparing methods, results, or critiquing the cited work.

So, the top three would be: Support, Similar, and Basis.

1. Support  
2. Similar  
3. Basis
