Alright, I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the plant health passage. Let me start by understanding the context. The passage uses the citation after mentioning that "Our finding... is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations." 

First, I extract the context. The sentence states that their finding is supported by another study, which is cited. That makes me think it's supporting their work.

Next, identifying the general intent. Since they're citing to confirm their results, that falls under Support.

Looking at the specific classes, Support is the first choice because they're directly backing their findings. There's no comparison involved, so CoCoRes or others like that don't apply here. Also, it's not about methods or future directions, so Usage or Future are out. It's not a weakness or motivation either.

So, the top class is Support. There's nothing else relevant here, so the other two spots can be left as Neutral since there's no additional intent.

1. Support  
2. Neutral  
3. Neutral
