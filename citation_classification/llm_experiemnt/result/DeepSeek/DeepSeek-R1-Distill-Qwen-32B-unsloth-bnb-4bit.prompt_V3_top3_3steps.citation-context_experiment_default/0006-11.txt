Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify the citations. First, I need to understand the context around each citation. The user provided some examples with their classifications, so I can look at those to get a sense.

Looking at the example where the classification was "Support," the context mentioned that the subscales were consistent with previous research. That makes sense because the citation is supporting the current findings by referencing prior work. So if a citation is used to back up the current results, it's likely "Support."

In another example, when the context talked about cross-taxon investigations supporting similar findings, the classification was "Similar." That makes sense because they're pointing out similarities between their results and others. So if the citation highlights similar results or phenomena, it's probably "Similar."

There's also a case where the citation was used to point out conflicting results between two studies. In that case, it was "CoCoXY," which is about comparing explanations or claims of two cited studies. So if the citation is used to compare two studies' findings, that's the one.

Another example had the classification as "Usage," where the citation was about the method used. So if the current study uses a method, tool, dataset, or setup from the cited work, it's "Usage."

When a citation is foundational, like introducing a key concept or theory that the current work builds upon, it's "Basis."

If the citation compares goals or methods with the current paper, it's "CoCoGM." For example, saying their methods are different or complementary.

If it's a comparison of results directly with the current study, then "CoCoRes."

If the intent is to motivate or justify the current research by pointing out a gap or open question, it's "Motivation."

If the citation suggests future research directions based on the cited work, it's "Future."

If the citation is pointing out limitations or flaws in the cited work, it's "Weakness."

Lastly, if there's a neutral mention without support, comparison, etc., it's "Neutral."

So the process would be: read the passage, identify the context around the citation, determine the general intent, and then map that to the most specific class from the predefined list, ensuring to pick the top three.

1. Similar  
2. Support  
3. Usage
