Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to classify the citation in the given plant health article. The task is to assign it to three rhetorical classes from the predefined list.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that in the study comparing two plant varieties, the authors reference a previous study conducted by @@CITATION@@. The context is about discussing past research to compare results.

Next, I'll identify the general intent. Since the focus is on comparing results from two plant varieties and referencing a previous study, it seems like a comparison scenario.

Looking at the possible classes:
- **CoCoRes** fits because it's comparing results with cited work.
- **Support** if the citation backs up their findings, but it's more about comparison here.
- **neutral** if it's just stating a fact without comparison, but the context implies a contrast.

So, the top three would prioritize comparison first, then support, and maybe neutral as a lesser fit.

To classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the plant health domain, I analyze the context where the citation is used to compare results from two plant varieties and reference a previous study. The primary intent is comparison.

1. **CoCoRes**: Because the citation is comparing results with a prior study.
2. **Support**: If the previous study's findings bolster the current results.
3. **Neutral**: If the citation is merely descriptive without highlighting comparison or support.

Here are the ranked classes:

1. CoCoRes  
2. Support  
3. Neutral
