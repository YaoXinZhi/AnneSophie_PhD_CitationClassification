Okay, so I need to figure out the top three rhetorical classes for the citation marked @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by extracting the context and understanding how the citation is used.

The passage says: "The identification of the causal agent and its characterization by molecular methods allowed us to confirm the pathogenic properties of Xanthomonas perforans in sweet cherry trees." Here, the citation is used right after they mention confirming the pathogenic properties of Xanthomonas perforans. 

Looking at the definitions, this seems to be supporting their finding. They're using a previous study to back up their current results, so that sounds like Support. 

Next, the citation is about molecular methods, which means they're using a specific technique that was detailed in the cited work. So that could also be Usage because they're referencing a method used in their study.

Now, thinking about the possible classes: 

1. Support is the most direct because they're confirming their findings with the cited research.
2. Usage is next because they're applying a method from the cited work.
3. Neutral is possible if the mention is just factual without a clear function, but in this case, they're using it to support and employ a method, so Neutral might be a lower priority.

So, I should rank them as Support first, Usage second, and Neutral third.

1. Support  
2. Usage  
3. Neutral
