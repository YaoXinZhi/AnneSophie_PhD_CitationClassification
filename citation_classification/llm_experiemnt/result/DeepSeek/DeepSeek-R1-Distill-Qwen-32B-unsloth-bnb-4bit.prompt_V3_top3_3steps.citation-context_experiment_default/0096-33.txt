Step 1: Extract context discussing @@CITATION@@.

The citation @@CITATION@@ is surrounded by the passage: "The citation @@CITATION@@ is cited in a passage where the authors describe their study on the effect of a fungal pathogen on wheat plants."

Step 2: Identify the general intent of the citation.

Looking at the context, the citation appears to be describing a study that's foundational to the current research. The authors mention describing their own study's focus on wheat plants. The citation is likely supporting their own research by referencing a previous study.

Step 3: Rank the top three rhetorical classes.

1. Basis: The citation seems to establish the foundation of the current research by referencing a past study.

2. Support: The citation supports the current study's focus on wheat plants by providing a relevant background.

3. Neutral: The citation could be neutrally mentioned as context without necessarily comparing or supporting explicitly.

The ranking may vary, but Basis is the most direct as it sets up the foundation.
