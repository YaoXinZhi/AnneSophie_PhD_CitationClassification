Okay, I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation marked @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by understanding the context.

The passage says, "The taxonomic status of these species is problematic and some may not develop on Pyrus @@CITATION@@." So, the sentence is pointing out that there's an issue with the classification of certain species described in the cited work. The researchers are saying that the cited study's taxonomic status is problematic, which means they're questioning or pointing out limitations in that previous work.

Now, looking at the predefined rhetorical classes, I need to match this intent. The general intent is critical or analytical, as the authors are pointing out a weakness in the cited work. 

Looking at the specific classes, "Weakness" seems like the most appropriate because the citation is used to critique or point out flaws in the cited study. 

Are there any other suitable classes? Let me check:

- Basis: Doesn't fit because it's not establishing the foundation.
- CoCoGM/CoCoRes/CoCoXY: Comparisons aren't happening between goals, results, or explanations here.
- Motivation/Future: Not about justifying research or suggesting future directions.
- Support/Similar: The context doesn't support or find similarities; instead, it's critical.
- Usage: The citation isn't about using a method or tool.
- Neutral: The usage here is clearly not neutral since it's pointing out a problem.

So, "Weakness" is the only fitting class here. But the task asks for three, so I need to list it as the top and then include the next plausible even if they don't fit perfectly. Maybe "CoCoRes" could be a stretch if considering contrasting results, but it's not directly comparing. Or "Neutral" if considering that it's a statement of fact without a clear critique, but that's less likely. Alternatively, since the passage is about the taxonomic status, "Usage" might not fit. Perhaps after "Weakness," "Neutral" is the second if considering the citation is just stating the problematic status without further critique. Third could be "Basis" if seeing it as foundational, but that's a stretch. Alternatively, "CoCoRes" as a comparison of results, but again, it's more of a critique than a direct comparison. I'm uncertain about the second and third, but I'll rank them based on proximity.

1. Weakness  
2. Neutral  
3. CoCoRes
