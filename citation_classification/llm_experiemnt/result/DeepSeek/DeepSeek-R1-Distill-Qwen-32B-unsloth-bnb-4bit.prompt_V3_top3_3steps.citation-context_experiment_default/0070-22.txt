Okay, so I have to figure out the top three rhetorical classes for the citation in the passage. Let me start by extracting the context discussing the citation @@CITATION@@. The passage says, "Earlier studies by @@CITATION@@ and @@CITATION@@ have shown that...", which indicates that the cited work provides foundational support for the current research. 

Next, identifying the general intent. The citation is used to justify the current research by referencing previous findings, so it's foundational. Now, looking at the predefined classes, the most likely are Basis because it's the intellectual foundation. 

For the other classes, since the passage doesn't compare, criticize, or suggest future work, I think CoCoXY might come second if it's discussing conflicting results. But in this case, the context is supportive, so Similar might be a better fit as the second option. 

Lastly, if there's a mention of supporting evidence, Support could be third. So, my top three are Basis, CoCoXY, and Similar.

1. Basis  
2. CoCoXY  
3. Similar
