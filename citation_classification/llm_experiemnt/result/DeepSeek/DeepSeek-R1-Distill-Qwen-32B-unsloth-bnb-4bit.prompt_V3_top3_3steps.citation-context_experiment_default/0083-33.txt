Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let's break it down step by step.

First, extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the authors replicated inoffensive results for the same purposes as the study cited. This suggests that the cited work provided a foundation for their current research.

Next, identify the general intent. Since they're replicating previous results, the citation is serving to establish a basis for their work. It's foundational because it sets the stage for what they're building upon.

Now, considering the predefined classes, the most appropriate would be Basis because they're referencing foundational research. CoCoRes isn't quite right because they aren't comparing results, just replicating. Support might be a stretch since they're not necessarily confirming findings, but just using them as a starting point.

So the top three classes would be Basis first, followed by Support if any, and then maybe Neutral.

To determine the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the context provided, I start by analyzing the sentence: "We began by replicating these inoffensive results for the same purposes." The use of "replicating" indicates that the cited work is serving as a foundation for the current research. 

1. **Basis**: The citation is foundational as it provides the basis for the current study by establishing the initial results that the authors are replicating.
2. **Support**: It supports the current work by providing a basis for replication, though this is secondary to being a foundation.
3. **Neutral**: While less relevant, the citation is also neutrally mentioned as part of the study's methodology.

#OUTPUT
1. Basis  
2. Support  
3. Neutral
