Okay, I need to classify the citation marked @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific passage. The task is to identify the top three rhetorical classes from the predefined list. First, I should extract the context surrounding @@CITATION@@. Looking at the passage, it mentions that the citation introduced and validated the IAT, studying biases considered universal. The current study began by replicating these results. 

Next, I determine the general intent. The citation is used as a foundation for the current research, which is replicating their work. That points to 'Basis' as the primary class. 

Now, looking for other possible classes. Since they're replicating the results without comparing methods or goals, comparative classes like CoCoGM or CoCoRes don't fit here. The passage doesn't indicate any criticism or suggest future directions, so 'Weakness' and 'Future' are out. The citation isn't used to support the current findings either, so 'Support' isn't applicable. 

The main intent is foundational, so 'Basis' is the first. Since no other classes strongly apply beyond the primary one, 'Neutral' might be the next as a fallback, but it's less likely because 'Basis' is a better fit. The third could be another foundational aspect if possible, but since 'Basis' is the only clear fit, I list it first, then 'Neutral' and 'Support' as secondary, even though they're not perfect.

1. Basis  
2. Neutral  
3. Support
