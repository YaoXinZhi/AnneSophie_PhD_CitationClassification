Okay, I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in this passage. Let me go through the steps as instructed.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage says, "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@@." 

So, the context mentions that a finding is supported by recent investigations. They're pointing out that in fleas and ticks, the host influenced bacterial assemblages, while other factors didn't. The citation is used to back up their finding.

Next, I need to identify the general intent. This seems like it's supporting their own results because they reference that their finding is supported by others. So, the intent is supportive.

Looking at the definitions, Support is when the citation is used to confirm or back up the authors' work. That fits here because they're citing others to show their results are consistent with existing studies. 

Other possible classes could be Similar, as the cited work might show a similar pattern or result. But in this case, it's more about supporting their own findings rather than just pointing out a similarity. 

Neutral is another option if it were just a factual mention, but since they're using it to support their own results, Neutral doesn't fit as well.

So, the top three would be Support, then Similar, and maybe Motivation, but Motivation doesn't apply here since it's not explaining why they're conducting the research. Wait, perhaps CoCoXY? But CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies with each other, not comparing with the citing paper. So that might not be the case here.

Alternatively, Neutral could be considered if the citation is just providing information without supporting or comparing, but since they explicitly say "is supported," Neutral might not be the best choice.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. The citation is supporting their own finding, so the primary class is Support. Maybe Similar is second because it's related results. Third, CoCoRes could be a stretch if it's comparing results with someone else's findings. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, considering that the cited work is about similar results from other investigations, perhaps Similar is the second. Third, maybe Neutral, but I'm not certain.

Hmm, maybe it's better to stick with Support as 1, Similar as 2, and Neutral as 3. Alternatively, if the citation is directly supporting their result, the main class is Support, then maybe Usage or Motivation? No, Motivation isn't applicable here.

After reconsidering, I think the main class is Support, then Similar, and maybe CoCoXY if they're contrasting different studies, but that's not clear here. Alternatively, Neutral could be included if the citation isn't being used argumentatively.

Wait, the example for Support is exactly this case. They are citing previous work to support their findings. So Support is first. 

Is there any comparison with the cited work here? Not exactly; they are just supporting their own finding with others, not comparing their methods or approaches. So Similar might not be applicable. Maybe Neutral as a third because the context could be seen as merely stating a fact.

I'm still a bit unsure, but I'll go with the first thought: Support is primary, then Similar as second, and Neutral as third.

1. Support  
2. Similar  
3. Neutral
