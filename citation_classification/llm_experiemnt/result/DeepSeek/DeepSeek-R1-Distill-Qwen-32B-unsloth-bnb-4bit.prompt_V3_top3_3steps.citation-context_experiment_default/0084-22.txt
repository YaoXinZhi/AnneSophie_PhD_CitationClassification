Step 1: Extract the context discussing the citation @@CITATION@@.

The passage mentions that the citation highlights recent work supporting the role of Xylella fastidiosa in olive tree disease. It compares findings from two studies, noting that while one found asymptomatic hosts, another identified the bacterium as the causal agent. 

Step 2: Identify the general intent.

The citation is used to compare findings between two studiesâ€”supporting the presence of Xylella fastidiosa in olive decline. This involves contrasting results rather than the methods or motivations behind the research.

Step 3: Assign top three rhetorical classes.

1. CoCoRes: The citation is directly comparing the results of two studies regarding the presence of the bacterium.
2. Support: The main intent is to support the current research's claim about the bacterium's role.
3. CoCoXY: There's a comparison between the explanations or claims of the two studies cited.
