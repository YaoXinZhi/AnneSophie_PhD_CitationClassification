Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the top three rhetorical classes for the citation marked @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let's go step by step.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions something about "the experimental set-up" and that it was "described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." So, the citation is referring back to a previous study where the setup was detailed.

Next, identifying the general intent. The context here is about a method or setup being used in the current study. That makes me think it's related to technical usage, meaning the citation is about using a method or tool from another work. So, according to the predefined list, that would relate to the 'Usage' class.

Now, I need to see if there are other possible classes. Since the citation is directly referring to a method used in the current study, 'Usage' seems like a strong fit. But are there others? Looking at the definitions, 'Support' might also come into play if the citation is used to confirm something, but in this case, it's more about employing a method rather than supporting a result. 'Similar' isn't quite right because there's no comparison of results or patterns; it's just about using the setup. And 'Basis' or 'Motivation' don't fit here as it's not about founding the research or explaining why the study is being done.

So, the top class is definitely 'Usage.' The other classes like 'Neutral' could be considered, but the citation is specifically about using a method, so 'Neutral' doesn't capture the intent as accurately. The next possible might be 'Neutral' as a fallback if nothing else fits, but I have to list three. 'Similar' could be a stretch, but it's not really about similarity. 'Support' might be third if 'Usage' is first, but since 'Usage' is the primary, I think the best options after that are 'Neutral' and maybe 'Similar' as less appropriate. Alternatively, considering the exact fit, 'Usage' is first, and perhaps 'Basis' if they're referring back to foundational work, but '_USAGE_ seems more precise.

Wait, actually, let me think again: the example given for 'Usage' is exactly this scenario, referring to the setup used from another study. So that's a clear 'Usage.' 'Neutral' is when it's just a neutral mention, but in this case, since they're using the method, it's more about 'Usage.' So maybe the other two could be 'Similar' and 'Neutral' if I have to pick three, but 'Usage' is number one, and the rest might not fit perfectly. Alternatively, perhaps 'Motivation' is involved, but no, it's not about why they're doing the research. 

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key is that the setup is used from another study, so 'Usage' is top. Then, could 'Basis' be second if it's foundational? Or 'CoCoGM' if comparing methods? But in the example given for 'CoCoGM,' they're comparing a cited work with their own. Here, it's just stating they used a previous setup, not comparing. So, 'Usage' is clear, and the next might be 'Neutral' and 'Similar' as less likely. Or maybe 'Basis' if it's a foundational setup.

I think the correct order would be:

1. Usage
2. Neutral
3. Similar

But I'm not entirely sure about 'Neutral' as second. Alternatively, 'Basis' could be second if they're using the setup as a foundation. But since the example is specifically about using the setup, 'Usage' is first. Maybe the second is 'Neutral' because they're just mentioning it without explicitly comparing or supporting. Third could be 'Basis' if they're using it as a foundation.

1. Usage  
2. Neutral  
3. Basis
