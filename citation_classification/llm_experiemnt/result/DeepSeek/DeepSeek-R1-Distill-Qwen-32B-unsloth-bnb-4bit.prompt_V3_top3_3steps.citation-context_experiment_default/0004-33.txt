Alright, I've got to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific passage. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I need to extract the context where @@CITATION@@ is mentioned. The passage says, "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@." So, the context is about the spread of a technology in the US since 1975.

Next, I should identify the general intent. The citation is simply providing a factual statement about the spread of magnetic water treatment devices without comparing, supporting, or critiquing. It's just a descriptive mention, so the intent is Neutral.

Now, looking at the predefined classes, the most appropriate would be Neutral because it's a neutral, descriptive use without any comparison, support, or critique. There's no motivation, future research suggestion, or usage of a method here. It's just stating a fact.

The other classes like CoCoGM, CoCoRes, etc., don't apply because there's no comparison or contrast involved. Support, Weakness aren't relevant since it's not supporting or criticizing. Usage isn't applicable either since it's not about a method being used. 

So, the top three classes are all Neutral, but since we need three distinct entries even if they are the same, I'll list Neutral three times.

3. Neutral
