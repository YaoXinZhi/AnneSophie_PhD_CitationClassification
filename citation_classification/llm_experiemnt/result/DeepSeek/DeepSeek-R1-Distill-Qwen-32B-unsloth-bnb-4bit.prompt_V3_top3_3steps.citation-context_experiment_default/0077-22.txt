Okay, I need to figure out the three most appropriate rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me go through the steps as outlined.

First, the context around @@CITATION@@ mentions the high multiplication rates and conflicting results between two studies. It says that two studies reported high rates, while another (cited) found conflicting results. So the citation is being used to highlight a discrepancy between studies.

Looking at the general intent, this seems to be a Comparative situation because the authors are comparing results from different studies. Specifically, the cited work (@@CITATION@@) is being contrasted with the previous findings of high multiplication rates.

Now, looking at the specific rhetorical classes, the most fitting would be CoCoRes because it involves comparing results directly. Since the comparison is between two different studies cited, CoCoXY might also apply as it's about comparing explanations or claims between two cited works. Lastly, since it's pointing out a contradiction, Neutral might not fit, but since it's part of a comparative context, maybe Neutral isn't the best. Alternatively, it's still a comparison, so perhaps CoCoRes is primary, CoCoXY is secondary, and then maybe Weakness or Support, but in this case, it's a comparison without necessarily supporting or criticizing, so Neutral could be considered third.
