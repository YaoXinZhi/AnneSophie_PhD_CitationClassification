Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the correct rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in this passage. Let me start by carefully reading the context provided. 

The passage says: "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@." 

First, I need to extract the context discussing the citation. The context here is that the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading in the USA since 1975, and the citation is used to support that statement. 

Next, I identify the general intent of the citation. It seems the citation is providing a reference to back up the spread of magnetic water treatment devices in the US. This doesn't seem to be comparing different studies, nor is it introducing a new method or pointing out a limitation. It's just stating a fact with a source.

Looking at the predefined classes, this falls under "Neutral" because the citation is used in a neutral, descriptive way without supporting or comparing specific arguments. It's simply giving a factual statement with a reference, so none of the other classes like Support, CoCoGM, or Motivation apply here. 

Since the intent is descriptive, the top three classes would all likely be Neutral, but since each list needs to be three, even if they're the same, I have to list Neutral three times.

1. Neutral  
2. Neutral  
3. Neutral
