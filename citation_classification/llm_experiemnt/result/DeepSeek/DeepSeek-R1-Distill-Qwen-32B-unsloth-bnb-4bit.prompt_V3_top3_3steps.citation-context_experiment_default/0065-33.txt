Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let's start by understanding the context. The passage says that previous research on a specific phytoplasma found conflicting results regarding its presence in different tissues of the plant. Specifically, it mentions that one study says it's concentrated in young leaves and some roots, while another study detected it in the xylem vessels. 

Now, looking at the examples provided for the different rhetorical classes, I need to find the best fit. The mention of conflicting results from two different studies points towards a comparison between these cited works. The example given for CoCoRes compares results directly, which aligns with how conflicting findings are highlighted here. 

Since the passage is pointing out conflicting data between two sources, the primary class should be CoCoRes. Next, because this comparison is used to show that there's inconsistency in the existing literature, it's also serving as a motivation for the current study to resolve this discrepancy. So, Motivation could be the second class. 

Lastly, the passage is presenting this information in a neutral way without explicitly supporting or criticizing either study, which makes Neutral the third classification.

1. CoCoRes  
2. Motivation  
3. Neutral
