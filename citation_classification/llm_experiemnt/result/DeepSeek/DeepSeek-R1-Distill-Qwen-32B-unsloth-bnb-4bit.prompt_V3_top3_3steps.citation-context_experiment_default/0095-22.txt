Alright, I'm going to tackle this classification task step by step. Let's break down the process.

First, I need to extract the context discussing the citation @@CITATION@@. I'll look for the passage around that citation to understand its purpose. Once I have the context, I'll analyze the intent. If the citation is foundational, it's a "Basis." If it's a comparison, then it could be CoCoGM, CoCoRes, or CoCoXY. 

Next, I identify the general intent. If the citation is explaining why the research is necessary, it's "Motivation." If it's suggesting future work, that's "Future." If it's supporting a point, it might be "Support" or "Similar." If it's about methodology, it's "Usage." If it's critical, "Weakness." If it's just a neutral mention, it's "Neutral."

After determining the general intent, I rank the top three specific rhetorical classes. I must choose from the predefined list: Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Motivation, Future, Support, Similar, Usage, Weakness, Neutral.

For example, if the citation is used to compare results, the classes would be CoCoRes, then perhaps CoCoXY if comparing explanations, and maybe Neutral if it's a minor mention.

I need to ensure I only pick three and rank them correctly from most to least appropriate.

1. CoCoRes  
2. CoCoXY  
3. Neutral
