Alright, I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation marked @@CITATION@@ in the passage provided. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, I need to extract the context where @@CITATION@@ is mentioned. From the passage, it's mentioned that "eighteen species were described from China," and there's a citation after that. So the context is about taxonomic descriptions, specifically of species found in China.

Next, identifying the general intent. The passage says the taxonomic status is problematic, implying that some species might not develop on Pyrus. This seems to be a criticism or pointing out limitations in the cited work.

Looking at the predefined classes, the most fitting one here is Weakness because it's pointing out that the cited study's results or methods have issues. There's also a Neutral class since the citation could just be stating facts without any positive or negative spin. Lastly, Support might be considered if the citation is being used to back up a statement, but it seems more like a criticism here.

So, the top three classes should be Weakness as the primary, then Neutral, and then Support, though the latter is a bit less likely.

1. Weakness  
2. Neutral  
3. Support
