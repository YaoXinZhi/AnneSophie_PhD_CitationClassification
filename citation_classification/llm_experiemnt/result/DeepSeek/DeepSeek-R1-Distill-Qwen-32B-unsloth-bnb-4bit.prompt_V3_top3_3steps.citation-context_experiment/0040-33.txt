Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by understanding the context. The passage mentions that the citation is about the multiplication rates and high concentration of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains in young leaves and roots. It also notes conflicting results for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima.

Hmm, the key here is that the citation is comparing two studies. One reports high concentrations in certain parts, and the other describes conflicting results. So the author is pointing out that there's inconsistency between these two cited works.

Looking at the predefined classes, CoCoXY is for comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies, which fits because the passage is contrasting the results of two different studies. That would be the primary class.

Next, the passage is discussing results from the cited works, so CoCoRes, which is about comparing results, could also be applicable. The author is showing that the results differ, so this is a secondary consideration.

Lastly, the passage is neutral in presenting these findings without necessarily supporting or opposing either. So Neutral might be the third class, as it's just stating the facts without taking a stance.

So, the top three classes would be CoCoXY, CoCoRes, and Neutral.

1. CoCoXY  
2. CoCoRes  
3. Neutral
