Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by reading the passage carefully. 

The passage says: "The taxonomic status of these species is problematic and some may not develop on Pyrus @@CITATION@@." Hmm, so the authors are pointing out that there's an issue with the classification of certain species. They mention that some might not develop on Pyrus, which is a genus of plants, I think. 

Looking at the context, the citation is used to support the claim that the taxonomic status is problematic. The authors are highlighting that the cited work's findings are questionable or have issues. So, they're using the citation to point out a weakness in the previous study.

Now, thinking about the rhetorical classes. The main classes are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Motivation, Future, Support, Similar, Usage, Weakness, and Neutral. 

In this case, the citation is used to criticize or point out limitations in the cited work. The authors are saying that the taxonomic status is problematic, which suggests they're highlighting a flaw or issue in the previous research. So, this fits under the Weakness category. 

Is there any other class that could apply here? Well, they're not comparing their work with the cited work, so CoCoGM, CoCoRes, or CoCoXY don't seem right. They're not using it as a foundation (Basis) or for motivation. They're not supporting their own findings with this citation; instead, they're pointing out a problem in the cited work. So, Weakness is definitely the primary class here.

Are there any secondary classes? Maybe Neutral, because the citation is also just stating a fact about the taxonomic status. But since the main intent is to point out a weakness, Neutral would be secondary. Alternatively, if the passage were just describing the taxonomic status without critique, it might be Neutral, but here it's used critically.

So, the top three would be Weakness as the primary, then perhaps Neutral as the second, and maybe Support if they're using the citation to back up their claim, but I think Support is more when the citation aligns with their findings, whereas here it's pointing out a problem. So, maybe Neutral is second, and Support is third, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, it could be that the third is Basis if they're building on this problematic classification, but I don't think so.

Wait, the passage is pointing out that the taxonomic status is problematic, so they're using the citation to highlight a flaw, which is Weakness. The other possible classes are Neutral because they're mentioning the taxonomic status, but the primary intent is critique. So, the order would be:

1. Weakness
2. Neutral
3. Maybe Support or Similar, but I'm leaning towards Neutral as second and then perhaps Support if they're using it to support their own argument about the problem.

Alternatively, if the citation is just providing information without critique, it's Neutral, but since they're pointing out the problem, Weakness is first, Neutral second, and maybe Basis if they're using it as a foundation for their argument, but I'm not sure.

I think the best order is:

1. Weakness
2. Neutral
3. Basis

1. Weakness  
2. Neutral  
3. Basis
