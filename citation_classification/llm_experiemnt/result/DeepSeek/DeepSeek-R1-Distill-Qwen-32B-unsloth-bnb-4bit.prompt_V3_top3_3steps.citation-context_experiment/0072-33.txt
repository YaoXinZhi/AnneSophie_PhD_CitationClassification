Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I'll look at the context. The passage says, "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@." The citation is used to back up the statement about the spread of these devices. It's a factual statement without any comparison or criticism.

Next, identifying the general intent. This seems descriptive, just stating a fact. It's not trying to compare, motivate, or criticize, so it's likely Neutral.

Now, assigning the rhetorical classes. The main class here is Neutral because it's a straightforward statement. There's no comparison, support, or motivation involved. The other possible classes like Support aren't applicable because it's not specifically supporting a point beyond stating the fact.

So, the top three classes would be Neutral first, followed by others that don't fit as well, but since the passage is purely descriptive, Neutral is the only relevant class. The other two could be from the predefined list but aren't applicable here.

1. Neutral  
2. Usage  
3. Support
