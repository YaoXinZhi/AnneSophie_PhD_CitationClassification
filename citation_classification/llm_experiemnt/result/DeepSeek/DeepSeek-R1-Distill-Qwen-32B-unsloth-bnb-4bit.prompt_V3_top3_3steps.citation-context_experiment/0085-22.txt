Okay, I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage into the top three rhetorical classes. Let me start by understanding the context and the definitions provided.

First, I'll look at the context where @@CITATION@@ is mentioned. The passage says: "Eighteen species, collected on cultivated and wild pear, were described from China @@CITATION@@. The taxonomic status of these species is problematic and some may not develop on Pyrus." 

Here, the citation is pointing out that the taxonomic status is problematic, suggesting that some species might not develop on Pyrus. This implies a critique of the cited work's findings or methodology.

Next, I'll refer to the predefined rhetorical classes. The citation is used to question or point out limitations in the cited work. The example given for 'Weakness' is when a cited work is described as problematic or flawed, which fits here.

Now, looking at other possible classes. It's not 'Support' because the authors aren't confirming the cited work; instead, they're highlighting issues. It's not 'CoCoRes' because they aren't comparing results directly with their own study. 'Neutral' doesn't apply since there's a critical tone. 

So, the most appropriate class is 'Weakness'. There might be a 'Neutral' element if the citation is just stating facts, but the critical tone makes 'Weakness' primary. 'CoCoRes' could be a secondary if considering comparison, but it's not direct. 'Neutral' might be third if any, but since the focus is on weakness, it's the top.

1. Weakness  
2. Neutral  
3. CoCoRes
