Alright, I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific passage. Let's go through the steps.

First, I extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the citation reports on the multiplication rates and concentration of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains in infected daisy plants. It also notes conflicting results for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima.

Next, I identify the general intent. The citation is comparing results from two studies: one showing high multiplication rates and another with conflicting findings. This suggests a comparative intent, specifically comparing results from different studies.

Now, I rank the rhetorical classes. The primary class is CoCoRes because it's comparing results. Then, since it's comparing two cited studies without involving the current paper, CoCoXY is next. Lastly, the passage isn't critical but descriptive, so Neutral is third.

So the top three classes are CoCoRes, CoCoXY, and Neutral.

1. CoCoRes  
2. CoCoXY  
3. Neutral
