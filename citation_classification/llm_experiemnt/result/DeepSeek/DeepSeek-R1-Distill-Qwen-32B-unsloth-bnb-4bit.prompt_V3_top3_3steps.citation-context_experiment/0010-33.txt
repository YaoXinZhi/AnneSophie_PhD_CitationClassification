Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me start by understanding the passage. It says that the citation discusses the fast multiplication rates and high concentration of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains in infected daisy plants. However, conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima.

First, I extract the context. The citation is talking about two studies: one where there are high concentrations of phytoplasma strains in daisy plants, and another where conflicting results were found in a different plant. The key here is the comparison between the two studies' results.

Next, I identify the general intent. The passage is comparing two cited studies, showing that while one found high concentrations, another found conflicting results. This is a comparison between the cited works, not directly with the current paper.

Now, looking at the rhetorical classes, CoCoXY is about comparing explanations or claims of two cited studies. That fits here because the citation points out conflicting results between two studies. 

CoCoRes is about comparing results directly with the current paper, but here it's comparing two other studies. So CoCoRes isn't the primary. 

Neutral might apply if the citation was just stating facts without comparison, but since it's highlighting the conflict, it's more than neutral. 

So the top class is CoCoXY. The next could be Neutral if it's just presenting the conflicting results without further analysis, but since it's explicitly comparing, CoCoXY is first. 

Wait, maybe CoCoRes isn't applicable because it's not comparing to the current paper's results. So the next possible is Neutral, but I think the main intent is to compare the two studies, so CoCoXY is the primary. 

I'm a bit confused about whether it's CoCoXY or CoCoRes. CoCoRes is for comparing with the current paper, while CoCoXY is for comparing two cited studies. Since the passage is comparing two studies, CoCoXY is correct. 

So the top three would be CoCoXY, then perhaps Neutral as a secondary, but since it's clearly a comparison, maybe only CoCoXY is the main one. But I need three. Maybe Weakness isn't applicable here because it's not criticizing the studies, just pointing out the conflict. 

So I think the order is 1. CoCoXY, 2. Neutral, 3. Support. Wait, no, Support is about confirming the current work. Here, it's more about presenting conflicting data. Maybe Neutral is second because it's just stating the results without supporting the current paper's findings. 

Alternatively, Neutral might not be necessary. I'm a bit stuck, but I'll go with CoCoXY as the primary, then Neutral, and then maybe Support as a stretch, but I'm not sure. Maybe the third is Weakness because the conflicting results might imply some issues, but that's a stretch. 

I think the best approach is to list CoCoXY first, then Neutral, and then maybe Weakness if the conflict implies a problem. But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, if the passage is just presenting the conflict without taking a stance, Neutral could be second, and then perhaps Support if it's supporting the idea that results vary. 

Hmm, maybe I should list CoCoXY as the top, then Neutral, and then Support. Or perhaps CoCoXY, then CoCoRes, but I think CoCoRes isn't applicable here. 

After considering, I'll settle on:

1. CoCoXY
2. Neutral
3. Weakness

1. CoCoXY  
2. Neutral  
3. Weakness
