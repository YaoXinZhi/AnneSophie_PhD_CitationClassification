Okay, I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage into the top three most appropriate rhetorical classes. Let me start by understanding the context and the definitions provided.

First, the passage mentions that the study uses a specific method to analyze plant health data. It refers to @@CITATION@@ to support their approach. So, the citation is used to back up their methodology.

Looking at the definitions, "Support" is when the citation confirms or supports the current work. That seems to fit because they're using the cited work to validate their method.

Next, "Basis" refers to foundational work. If the cited study is a key foundational paper that their method builds upon, it could be a basis. But the passage doesn't explicitly state that it's foundational, just that it supports their approach.

"Usage" involves citing a method, tool, or dataset used directly. Here, they're using a method from the cited work, so "Usage" is also relevant.

So, the top three classes would be Support, Basis, and Usage.

1. Support  
2. Basis  
3. Usage
