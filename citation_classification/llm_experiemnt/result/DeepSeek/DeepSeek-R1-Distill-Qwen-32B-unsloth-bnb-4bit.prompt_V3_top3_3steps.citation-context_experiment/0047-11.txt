Okay, so I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage into the top three rhetorical classes. Let's start by understanding the context and the task.

First, the passage is about a study on plant health, specifically discussing how insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly. The authors mention their findings and then reference another study. The sentence is: "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@@."

Looking at Step 1, I need to extract the context around @@CITATION@@. The context here is that the authors are supporting their own finding by citing another study that found similar results in different insects.

Step 2 is identifying the general intent. The citation is used to back up their own results, so it's supportive.

Now, Step 3 is assigning the top three rhetorical classes. The primary class is Support because the citation directly supports their findings. Next, it's also a Similar case because the cited study shows a similar pattern in different organisms. Lastly, it's not a comparison of methods or results with the current study, so Neutral might apply as a third option, though it's less likely than Support and Similar.

So, the top three are Support, Similar, and Neutral.

1. Support  
2. Similar  
3. Neutral
