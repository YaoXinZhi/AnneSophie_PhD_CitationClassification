Okay, so I need to figure out the top three rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by understanding the context and the task.

First, the passage mentions that the citation is used to compare the results of the cited work with another study. The example given is about conflicting results regarding phytoplasma in different plants. This suggests that the citation is being used to contrast findings from two studies.

Looking at the predefined classes, CoCoXY is about comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies, which fits here because the passage is pointing out conflicting results between two studies. So CoCoXY is definitely the first choice.

Next, I need to determine the next most appropriate classes. Since the citation is about conflicting results, it's also a form of comparison, but more specifically, it's about the results themselves. So CoCoRes, which deals with comparing results, might be the second choice.

Alternatively, the citation could be seen as pointing out a similarity in the context of conflicting results, but that's a stretch. It's more about the contrast. So perhaps the third choice could be Neutral, as the citation is presented in a descriptive manner without strong support or criticism.

So, my top three would be CoCoXY, CoCoRes, and Neutral.

1. CoCoXY  
2. CoCoRes  
3. Neutral
