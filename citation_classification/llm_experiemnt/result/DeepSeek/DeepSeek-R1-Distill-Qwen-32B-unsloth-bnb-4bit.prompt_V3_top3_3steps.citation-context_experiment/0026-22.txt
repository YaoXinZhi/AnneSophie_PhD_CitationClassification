Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by extracting the context. The passage mentions that the citation is about a study where researchers found a specific strain of 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' in daisy plants, reporting high multiplication rates and concentrations in certain parts. However, conflicting results were noted for another phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima. 

Now, I need to determine the general intent of this citation. It seems like the authors are comparing two studies. One reports high multiplication rates, and the other describes conflicting results. This comparison is between two cited studies, not necessarily contrasting with the current paper's findings. So, this is a case where the citation is used to compare two studies with each other.

Looking at the predefined classes, CoCoXY fits because it's about comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies. Next, the passage is pointing out a similarity in the context of phytoplasma studies, so Similar might also apply. Lastly, since the comparison is somewhat neutral in the context of the discussion, Neutral could be a third option, though it's less direct than the first two.

So, the top three classes would be CoCoXY, Similar, and Neutral.

1. CoCoXY  
2. Similar  
3. Neutral
