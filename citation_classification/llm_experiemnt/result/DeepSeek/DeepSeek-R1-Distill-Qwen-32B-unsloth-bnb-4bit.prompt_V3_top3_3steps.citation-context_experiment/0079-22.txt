Okay, so I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. Let me go through the process step by step.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the citation reports on the multiplication rates and concentration of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains in young leaves and roots. It also notes conflicting results described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima.

Next, I'll identify the general intent. The citation is comparing two studies: one showing high multiplication rates and another with conflicting results. This seems to be a comparison between two cited works, not directly with the current paper.

Looking at the predefined classes, CoCoXY fits because it's about comparing explanations or claims between two studies. Support isn't the case here because it's not confirming the current work. Neutral is less likely since the citation is actively comparing results, not just stating facts.

So, the top three classes are CoCoXY, then maybe Neutral if considering it's a neutral comparison, but I think CoCoXY is primary. Support isn't applicable here.

1. CoCoXY  
2. Neutral  
3. Support
