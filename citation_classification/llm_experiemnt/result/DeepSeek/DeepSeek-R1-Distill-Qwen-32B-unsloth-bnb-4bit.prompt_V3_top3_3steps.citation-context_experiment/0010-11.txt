Okay, so I need to figure out the top three rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific passage about plant health. Let me go through the steps as outlined.

First, I should extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the citation describes the presence of a specific pathogen in a particular plant species. It also notes that this finding is consistent with previous studies. 

Next, I need to identify the general intent. Since the citation is supporting the current findings by referencing previous work, the general intent seems to be supportive.

Now, looking at the predefined classes, Support is a likely candidate because the citation is confirming the current work. Similar might also be applicable because it's pointing out that the results align with others. Additionally, Neutral could be considered since it's a straightforward mention without necessarily comparing or contrasting beyond support.

So, the top three would be Support, Similar, and Neutral.

1. Support  
2. Similar  
3. Neutral
