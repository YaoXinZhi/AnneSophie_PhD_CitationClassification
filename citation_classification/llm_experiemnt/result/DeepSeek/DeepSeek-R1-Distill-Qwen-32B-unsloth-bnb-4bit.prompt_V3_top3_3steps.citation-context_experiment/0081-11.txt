Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in a scientific article passage into the top three rhetorical classes. First, I'll extract the context around the citation to understand its intent.

Looking at the passage, the citation is mentioned in the context of comparing two studies on the multiplication rates of 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains in daisy plants. The author notes that while some studies report high rates, others describe conflicting results for a different phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima. The citation here is used to highlight discrepancies between two studies.

Next, I'll identify the general intent. Since the citation is comparing two studies' results, it's a comparative intent. Specifically, the author is contrasting findings from different studies, which points towards a comparison of explanations or claims.

Now, I'll map this to the predefined classes. The most appropriate is CoCoXY because it's comparing two cited works. The next would be CoCoRes, as it's comparing results, even though it's between two studies. Lastly, Neutral could be considered if the citation is merely stating facts without direct comparison, but since it's used to contrast, Neutral is less fitting.

1. CoCoXY  
2. CoCoRes  
3. Neutral
