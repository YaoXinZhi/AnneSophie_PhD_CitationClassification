Alright, I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific passage. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the citation describes the multiplication rates of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains in young leaves and roots of infected daisy plants. It also notes conflicting results for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima.

Next, I should identify the general intent of the citation. The context is comparing results from different studies. The first part reports high multiplication rates, while the second part mentions conflicting results. This suggests a comparison between two cited studies, not with the current paper's results.

Looking at the predefined classes, CoCoXY fits because it's about comparing explanations or claims between two cited works. The passage is contrasting findings from Wei et al. and another study, so CoCoXY is the primary class.

Then, I consider if there are other applicable classes. The citation is pointing out a similarity in the type of results (both dealing with phytoplasma multiplication), so Similar could be a secondary class. Additionally, since the passage is describing the findings without directly supporting or opposing them, Neutral might also apply as a tertiary class.

So, the top three classes are CoCoXY, Similar, and Neutral.

1. CoCoXY  
2. Similar  
3. Neutral
