Alright, I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. First, I need to extract the context. The passage says, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." 

So, the context is comparing the current study's results with those from another study using deuterium targets. The general intent here seems to be a comparison of results because the authors are pointing out differences between their findings and those of the cited work.

Looking at the predefined classes, the most appropriate would be CoCoRes since it's directly comparing results. Next, since they're contrasting two studies, CoCoXY might also fit because it's about comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies. However, the passage only mentions one citation, so maybe CoCoXY isn't the best fit. Alternatively, Neutral could be considered if the comparison is presented without a strong supporting or critical tone. But since the comparison highlights differences, it leans more towards a comparative intent. 

So, the top three classes are CoCoRes, then CoCoXY, and finally Neutral.

1. CoCoRes  
2. CoCoXY  
3. Neutral
