Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by reading the passage carefully to understand the context. 

The passage mentions that the citation is used to support a finding about the effect of a magnetic field on calcite scale formation. It says, "Our previous research @@CITATION@@ has shown that the formation of the hard calcite scale on the surfaces exposed to hard water can be successfully prevented with the applied magnetic field." 

So, the citation is referring to a prior study that demonstrated the effectiveness of a magnetic field in preventing calcite scale. The current paper is using this prior work to back up their own findings. 

Looking at the predefined classes, "Support" seems to fit here because the citation is confirming or backing up the current research's results. There's no comparison involved, just a direct support of the findings. 

I don't think it's "Basis" because the citation isn't laying the foundation for the current research; it's supporting a specific result. It's also not "Motivation" because the paper isn't citing it to justify why they're conducting the research, but rather to confirm their results. 

So, the top class is definitely "Support." The other classes like "CoCoRes" or "Similar" don't apply here because there's no comparison or similarity being drawn. It's a straightforward support of the current findings. 

Therefore, the top three classes would be Support, followed by Neutral since it's a neutral reference without any comparison, and then maybe Weakness, but that's not applicable here. Wait, no, Weakness isn't relevant because the citation isn't being criticized. So, the next appropriate after Support might be Neutral, and then perhaps Usage, but the passage doesn't mention using a method or tool from the cited work. 

Hmm, maybe after Support, the next is Neutral because the citation is just a reference without any comparative or critical tone. Then, perhaps Usage, but I'm not sure if that applies. Alternatively, it could be Basis, but I think Support is the primary here. 

Wait, let me reconsider. The passage uses the citation to support their findings, so Support is first. If there's no comparison, then the next might be Neutral because it's a neutral reference. The third could be Basis if it's foundational, but I'm not certain. 

I think I'll stick with Support as the top, Neutral as second, and maybe Basis as third, but I'm not entirely sure about the third one. Alternatively, it might be that the third is Usage if they're referring to a method, but the passage doesn't mention that. 

No, the passage just mentions the result, so it's more about supporting than using a method. So, I'll go with Support, Neutral, and perhaps Basis as the third, but I'm not entirely confident. Maybe Basis isn't appropriate here. Alternatively, it could be that the third is Similar if they're pointing out a similarity, but again, it's more about support. 

I think the best approach is to list Support as the primary, Neutral as the second, and then perhaps Similar as third, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it might be that the third is Usage, but I don't see a method being referenced. 

Wait, the passage says "Our previous research @@CITATION@@ has shown..." which indicates that the cited work is their own prior work, so it's more about supporting their current findings with their past results. So, Support is definitely first. 

The second might be Neutral because it's a reference without any comparative or critical analysis. The third could be Basis if it's establishing a foundation, but in this context, it's more about supporting the current findings rather than laying the foundation. 

So, I think the top three are Support, Neutral, and then maybe Similar, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, it could be that the third is CoCoRes if they're comparing results, but the passage doesn't mention comparing results. 

Wait, the passage is just stating that their previous research supports their current findings, so it's a straightforward support without comparison. Therefore, the top three would be Support, Neutral, and perhaps Usage, but I don't think Usage applies here. 

I think I'll settle on Support as the first, Neutral as the second, and then maybe Basis as the third, even though I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, it could be that the third is Similar, but I don't see a similarity being pointed out. 

No, I think the best fit is Support, Neutral, and then perhaps Basis, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, it could be that the third is Usage, but again, the passage doesn't mention using a method or tool from the cited work. 

I think I've thought it through enough. The top three classes are Support, Neutral, and then perhaps Basis.

1. Support  
2. Neutral  
3. Basis
