Alright, I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the citation is about a study where fast multiplication rates and high concentrations of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains were reported in young leaves and roots of infected daisy plants. However, conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima. The citation is used to point out this conflict.

Next, I identify the general intent. The citation is comparing two studies, one that found high concentrations and another that found conflicting results. This seems like a comparative intent, specifically contrasting results from two different studies.

Looking at the predefined classes, CoCoXY is about comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies. That fits because the citation is highlighting conflicting results between two studies. 

CoCoRes is about comparing results, which is similar but more focused on direct comparison of findings. Here, it's more about the explanations or claims leading to conflicting results, so CoCoXY might be more appropriate.

Neutral could be a possibility if the citation was just stating facts without comparison, but since it's pointing out conflicting results, it's more analytical than neutral.

So, the top three classes would be CoCoXY as the primary, then CoCoRes as a secondary because it's about results, and Neutral as the least applicable.

1. CoCoXY  
2. CoCoRes  
3. Neutral
