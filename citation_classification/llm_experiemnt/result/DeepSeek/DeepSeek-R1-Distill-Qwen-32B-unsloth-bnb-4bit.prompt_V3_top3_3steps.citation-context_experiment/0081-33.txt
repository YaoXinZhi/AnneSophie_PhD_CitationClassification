Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let's start by understanding the context. The passage says, "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." 

Step 1: Extract the context. The sentence is talking about the experimental setup, which is a method or procedure. The citation is pointing to where this setup was previously described.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. Since the citation is referring to a method used in the current study, the intent is likely technical. The authors are using a method from a previous work, so they're referencing a tool or setup.

Step 3: Assign the rhetorical classes. The primary class here is Usage because they're using a method from the cited work. There's no comparison, motivation, or weakness mentioned. So the top class is Usage. Next, since they're referencing a previous work for a method, it could also be a Basis if it's foundational, but since they're directly using it, Usage is more precise. There's no support or similarity mentioned, so the next possible might be Neutral, but I think Usage is the main one. Maybe Basis is second if the method is fundamental. Alternatively, if they're just mentioning it without any comparison or support, Neutral could be second. But I think Usage is the best fit here.

Wait, the example given for Usage is exactly this scenario: citing a previous setup. So the first class is definitely Usage. Then, since it's a method used, it's not a comparison, so CoCo classes are out. It's not Motivation or Future. It's not Weakness. So the next possible could be Neutral because it's a straightforward mention without any supporting or contrasting. But Usage is the main. So the top three would be Usage, then Neutral, and maybe Basis if it's foundational, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, Neutral might not be necessary because the primary is Usage, and the others don't fit as well.

Wait, the example given for Usage is: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." So the correct class is Usage. So the top class is Usage. Then, since the passage is just stating a fact without supporting or comparing, the next could be Neutral. But since the main intent is to refer to a method used, Usage is the only clear one. Maybe the other classes aren't applicable here. So the top three would be Usage, then perhaps Neutral, and then maybe Basis if it's foundational, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, since the passage doesn't provide any motivation or comparison, the other classes don't fit as well. So I think the top class is Usage, and the others are less relevant.

1. Usage  
2. Neutral  
3. Basis
