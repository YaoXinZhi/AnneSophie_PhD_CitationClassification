Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by extracting the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the authors studied the distribution of a certain pathogen and found it in several hosts. They reference @@CITATION@@, which reported the pathogen in a specific host in China. 

Now, looking at the intent, the citation is being used to support their own findings by pointing out a similarity. The authors are showing that their results align with previous research. So, the general intent is supportive.

Next, I need to assign the top three rhetorical classes. The most appropriate seems to be 'Similar' because they're highlighting a similarity in findings. 'Support' is next since the citation backs their results. 'Neutral' could be third because the citation is presented without any comparative or critical tone, just stating the fact.

1. Similar  
2. Support  
3. Neutral
