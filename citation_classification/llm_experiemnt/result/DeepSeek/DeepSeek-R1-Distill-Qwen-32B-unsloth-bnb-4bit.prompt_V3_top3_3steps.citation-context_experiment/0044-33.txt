Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by understanding the context. The passage mentions that the citation is about a study on aphid gut binding peptides and their interference with virus uptake. It also notes that the peptide binds to other aphid species, suggesting broader applicability.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The key points are that the cited study showed the peptide's interference and its binding to different aphid species, implying potential broader use. 

Next, identifying the general intent. This seems to be about suggesting future research directions because the example talks about the peptide's applicability beyond the initial study. So, it's pointing towards future possibilities.

Now, assigning rhetorical classes. The most appropriate is Future since it's about suggesting future work. Support is next because the citation supports the idea of broader applicability. Neutral is third because while it's a factual statement, it's primarily used to support and suggest future directions rather than just being neutral.

1. Future  
2. Support  
3. Neutral
