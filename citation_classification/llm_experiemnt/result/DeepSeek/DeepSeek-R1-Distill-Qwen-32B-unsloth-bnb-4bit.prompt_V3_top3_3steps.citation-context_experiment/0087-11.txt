Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the citation reports the presence of a specific strain of phytoplasma in infected daisy plants and notes conflicting results for another phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima. This suggests that the authors are comparing different studies.

Next, I identify the general intent. Since they're comparing results from two different studies, this falls under a comparative intent. Specifically, they're contrasting the findings of two cited works.

Looking at the predefined classes, the most appropriate would be CoCoXY because it involves comparing two cited studies. Then, CoCoRes is next since it's about comparing results, though here it's between two other studies, not directly with the current paper. Finally, Neutral might apply if the citation is just presenting information without a strong comparative angle, but since the context is about comparison, Neutral is the least likely here.

1. CoCoXY  
2. CoCoRes  
3. Neutral
