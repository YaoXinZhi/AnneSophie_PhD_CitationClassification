Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific passage. Let me start by understanding the context and the task.

First, the user provided a passage where the citation is used. The passage mentions that the citation supports the finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly. It specifically refers to recent cross-taxon investigations in fleas and ticks, where the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages. 

Looking at the definitions, I need to determine the intent of the citation. The example given under the 'Similar' class mentions that the citation points out a similarity between the cited work and the current paper, particularly in results or patterns. Here, the citation is used to show that the current finding aligns with other studies on different insects, indicating a similarity in results.

Next, the 'Support' class is when the citation is used to confirm or back up the authors' work. In this case, the citation supports the claim that the insect host affects bacterial assembly, so 'Support' is also applicable.

The 'Neutral' class is when the citation is used without any specific argumentative purpose. However, in this context, the citation is being used to support and show similarity, so 'Neutral' might not be the primary intent but could be a secondary consideration if the citation is also providing general information without a specific argument.

So, the top three classes would be 'Similar' as the primary because it's pointing out a similarity in results across different studies. 'Support' comes next because it's backing up the current finding. 'Neutral' might be third if the citation is also serving a descriptive purpose beyond just supporting.

1. Similar  
2. Support  
3. Neutral
