Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage says, "Our previous research @@CITATION@@ has shown that the formation of the hard calcite scale on the surfaces exposed to hard water can be successfully prevented with the applied magnetic field. The explanation of the phenomena is not yet offered and the purpose of this work is to try to understand the mechanism of the beneficial influence of the magnetic treatment."

Okay, so the context is about previous research that demonstrated the prevention of calcite scale using a magnetic field. The current study aims to understand the mechanism behind this effect.

Next, I'll identify the general intent of the citation. The citation is referring to prior work that established a certain result (preventing scale formation with a magnetic field). The current paper is building on this by exploring the underlying mechanism. This seems to be foundational because it's setting the stage for the current research by referencing earlier work that provided a basis for their study.

Now, looking at the predefined classes, the general intent here is "Foundational," which corresponds to the "Basis" class. The citation is used to establish the foundation for the current research by referencing earlier findings.

Are there other possible classes? Let's see. It's not a comparison of goals or methods (CoCoGM), nor is it comparing results (CoCoRes) or explanations (CoCoXY). It's not motivational in the sense of future directions or justifying the research (Motivation), nor is it suggesting future work (Future). It's not supporting or confirming their own findings (Support), nor pointing out similarities (Similar). It's not about usage of a method, tool, etc. (Usage), nor is it critical (Weakness), nor is it neutral.

So the most appropriate class is "Basis." Are there any other possible classes? Maybe "Motivation" because it's explaining why the current research is being done, but the primary intent is to establish the foundation. So "Basis" is the top, followed by "Motivation" as a secondary because it does hint at the reason for the current study. Third, perhaps "Neutral" since it's a straightforward mention without comparison or criticism.

Wait, but "Neutral" is when the citation is just descriptive without supporting or comparing. In this case, it's used to set the stage, so "Basis" is the primary. "Motivation" could be secondary because it's explaining the purpose. "Support" might not fit because it's not supporting the current findings but rather establishing the foundation. So I think the top three are Basis, Motivation, and Neutral.

1. Basis  
2. Motivation  
3. Neutral
