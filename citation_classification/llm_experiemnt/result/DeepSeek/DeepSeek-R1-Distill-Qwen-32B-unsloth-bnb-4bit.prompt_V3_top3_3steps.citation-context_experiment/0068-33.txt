Okay, I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific passage into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. Let me start by understanding the context and the task.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the citation is about a study on the multiplication rates and concentration of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains in infected daisy plants. It also notes conflicting results for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima.

Next, I need to determine the general intent of the citation. The passage is comparing results from different studies. It mentions that while some studies report high multiplication rates, others describe conflicting results. This suggests that the citation is being used to compare findings between studies.

Looking at the predefined classes, the most appropriate would be CoCoXY because it's about comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies. The passage isn't directly comparing with the current paper's results, but rather contrasting two different studies. 

CoCoRes is also relevant because it's about comparing results, but since the comparison is between two other studies rather than with the current paper, CoCoXY is a better fit. Neutral could be a third option since the citation is presented as factual without supporting or opposing any argument.

So, the top three classes are CoCoXY, CoCoRes, and Neutral.

1. CoCoXY  
2. CoCoRes  
3. Neutral
