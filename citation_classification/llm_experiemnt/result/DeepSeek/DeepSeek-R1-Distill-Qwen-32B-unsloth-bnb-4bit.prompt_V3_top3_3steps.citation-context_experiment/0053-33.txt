Okay, I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific passage into the top three rhetorical classes. Let's start by understanding the context.

Step 1: Extract the context discussing the citation. The passage mentions that the citation reports the presence of a pathogen in a specific region, and the current study found the same pathogen in another region. So the context is about the occurrence of the pathogen in two different areas.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation is pointing out a similarity in findings between the cited work and the current study. Both studies found the same pathogen, so the intent is to show a similarity.

Step 3: Assign the top three rhetorical classes. The most appropriate is 'Similar' because it highlights a shared result. Next, 'Support' since the citation supports the current findings. Lastly, 'Neutral' as it's a straightforward mention without comparison or criticism.
