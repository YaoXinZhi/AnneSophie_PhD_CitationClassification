Alright, I need to assign the top three rhetorical classes to the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by understanding the context and the definitions.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the citation supports the finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly. It specifically states that the cited work also found similar results in fleas and ticks.

Next, I'll identify the general intent. Since the citation is used to back up the current study's findings, the intent is supportive.

Now, looking at the specific classes, Support is the most appropriate because it directly confirms the work. Similar is next since it highlights the same results in other studies. Neutral is third because there's no comparison or criticism, just a straightforward mention.

So, the top three classes are Support, Similar, and Neutral.

1. Support  
2. Similar  
3. Neutral
