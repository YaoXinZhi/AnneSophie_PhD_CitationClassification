Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. First, I need to understand the context where the citation is used. The passage is talking about the multiplication rates of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains in young leaves and roots, citing Wei et al., 2004, and then mentioning conflicting results from another study by @@CITATION@@. 

So, the context is about conflicting findings between two studies. The first part of the sentence mentions reports of high multiplication rates, and then it contrasts that with conflicting results from another study. This suggests that the authors are comparing two different studies' findings.

Looking at the definitions, CoCoRes is about comparing results directly between the cited work and the citing paper. But in this case, it's comparing two cited works with each other, not the citing paper. So that might point towards CoCoXY, which is for comparing two cited studies. 

Alternatively, since the passage is discussing conflicting results, it's a form of comparison between the two studies. So CoCoXY seems appropriate. 

Next, the passage is highlighting a contradiction, which might also imply a critical view of one or both studies, but since it's just stating the conflict without necessarily criticizing, it's more about the comparison rather than weakness. 

So, the top class would be CoCoXY. Then, since it's a comparison of results, CoCoRes could be a secondary consideration, even though it's not directly comparing to the citing paper. Lastly, the passage is neutral in presenting these conflicting results without supporting or opposing either, so Neutral might be the third class.

1. CoCoXY  
2. CoCoRes  
3. Neutral
