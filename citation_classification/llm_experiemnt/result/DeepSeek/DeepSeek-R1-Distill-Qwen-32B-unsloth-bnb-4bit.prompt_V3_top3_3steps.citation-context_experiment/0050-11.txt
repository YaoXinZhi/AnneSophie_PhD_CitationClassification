Alright, I'm trying to figure out the top three rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me go through the steps as outlined.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the citation is about the formation of hard calcite scale on surfaces exposed to hard water and how magnetic fields can prevent it. It also states that the mechanism isn't explained yet, and this current work aims to understand it.

Next, I should identify the general intent. The citation is explaining previous findings that show magnetic fields can prevent scale formation but haven't explained why. The current study is motivated by this gap, so the intent seems to be motivational.

Looking at the predefined classes, Motivation fits because the citation is highlighting a knowledge gap that the current research is addressing. Future might be a stretch since it's not directly suggesting future directions but rather justifying the current work. Support could be considered if the citation is backing up the current study's premise, but it's more about motivation.

So, the top three classes would be Motivation as the primary, then maybe Future if it's implying where the research could go next, and Support if it's confirming the need for this study. But I'm not sure about Future here. Alternatively, it could be Neutral if the citation is just stating facts without motivation, but that doesn't seem right since it's explaining why the current study is needed.

1. Motivation  
2. Future  
3. Support
