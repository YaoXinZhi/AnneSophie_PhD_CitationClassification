Alright, I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the citation discusses the multiplication rates and conflicting results of a phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima. It also references two other studies, Wei et al., 2004, and Saracco et al., 2006. The context is comparing different studies' findings on phytoplasma multiplication rates.

Next, I should identify the general intent. Since the citation is comparing the results of different studies, the intent is comparative. Specifically, it's contrasting the results between the cited work and another study, not the current paper.

Now, looking at the predefined classes, the most appropriate would be CoCoXY because it's comparing two cited studies with each other. The passage mentions conflicting results, which fits this category. 

The second most appropriate might be Neutral, as the citation is presented in a descriptive manner without explicitly supporting or criticizing. 

Third, it could be Support if the current paper is using this comparison to back up its own findings, but since the context is more about contrasting studies, Support isn't the primary intent here.

1. CoCoXY  
2. Neutral  
3. Support
