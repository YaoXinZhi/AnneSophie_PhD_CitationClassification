Okay, so I need to figure out the top three rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by understanding the context and the task.

First, the passage is about a study on the hard calcite scale formed by hard water and the effect of magnetic treatment. The authors mention that their previous research showed that magnetic fields can prevent scale formation but the mechanism isn't understood yet. They reference @@CITATION@@ as the source of this previous finding.

Now, I need to extract the context around the citation. The context is that the authors are citing their own previous work to establish that they've already shown the effectiveness of magnetic treatment but are now looking to understand why it works. This is a foundational step for their current research.

Next, identifying the general intent. The citation is used to justify why they're conducting the current research because it points out a knowledge gapâ€”the mechanism isn't known. So, the general intent is Motivational.

Looking at the predefined classes, the most appropriate would be Motivation because it's explaining why the current study is necessary. Then, Basis might be considered because it's a foundational reference, but Motivation is more precise here. Support could be a stretch if the citation is confirming their approach, but it's more about motivating the study. So the top three are Motivation, Basis, and Support.

Wait, but the example for Motivation in the definitions does use a citation to justify the current research, which matches here. Basis is also applicable since it's foundational, and Support could be a secondary if it's confirming their approach. So the order would be Motivation first, then Basis, then Support.

1. Motivation  
2. Basis  
3. Support
