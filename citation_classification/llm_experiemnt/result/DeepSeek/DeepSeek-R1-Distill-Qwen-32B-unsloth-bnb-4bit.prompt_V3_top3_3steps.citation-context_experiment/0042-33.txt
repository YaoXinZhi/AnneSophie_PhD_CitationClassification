Okay, I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage says, "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." So, the citation is referring to a previous description of an experimental setup.

Next, I identify the general intent. The authors are mentioning a prior work that detailed their experimental setup. This sounds like they're using the cited work as a reference for their current study's methodology. That points towards the 'Technical' category, which is associated with the 'Usage' class.

Looking at the predefined classes, 'Usage' is when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or setup used in the current study. Since the citation is about the experimental setup, it fits perfectly into 'Usage'.

Now, are there any other possible classes? Well, 'Support' could be considered if they were confirming a result, but here they're just referencing the setup, not the results. 'Basis' is about foundational research, but this is more about the method used. 'Neutral' might be another option if it's just a mention without any particular stance, but since they're using it as a reference for their setup, 'Usage' is more precise.

So, the top class is definitely 'Usage'. The next possible might be 'Neutral' if it's just a mention without any specific intent beyond referencing, but 'Usage' is more accurate. There's no comparison or motivation here, so other classes like 'CoCoGM' or 'Motivation' don't apply. 

Therefore, the top three rhetorical classes would be 'Usage' as the primary, followed by 'Neutral' if we consider a more neutral mention, and maybe 'Basis' if it's foundational, but I think 'Usage' is the most appropriate.

1. Usage  
2. Neutral  
3. Basis
