Okay, I need to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation marked @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage says, "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@@."

So, the context is about supporting the current finding with another study. The authors mention that their finding is supported by recent investigations, specifically citing another work. The key here is that the citation is used to back up their own results.

Next, I'll identify the general intent. The citation is used to support the current work's findings, so the general intent is supportive.

Looking at the predefined classes, the most appropriate would be 'Support' because the citation is directly supporting the current findings. There's also a mention of similarity in the context, as they're pointing out that other studies have similar results, so 'Similar' could be the second class. Since the citation is used to confirm their results without comparing methods or goals, 'CoCoRes' might not fit here. However, the primary use is support, so 'Support' is first, 'Similar' second, and perhaps 'Neutral' as a third if there's no other clear fit, but I think 'Support' and 'Similar' are the main ones.

1. Support  
2. Similar  
3. Neutral
