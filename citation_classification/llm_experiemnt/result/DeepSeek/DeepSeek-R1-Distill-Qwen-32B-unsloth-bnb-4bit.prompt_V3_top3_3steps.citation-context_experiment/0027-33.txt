Okay, I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by extracting the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the study found a high level of genetic diversity among the plant samples and references the citation as supporting this finding. 

Next, I'll determine the general intent. Since the citation is used to back up the current study's results, the intent is supportive. Now, looking at the predefined classes, Support is the most appropriate because it directly confirms the findings. 

I should also consider other possible classes. The citation doesn't compare methods or results with other studies, so CoCoGM or CoCoRes aren't suitable. It's not pointing out a similarity or a weakness either. Therefore, the top three classes are Support, and then perhaps Neutral or Usage if there's a tie, but Support is clearly the best fit.

1. Support  
2. Neutral  
3. Usage
