Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me start by understanding the context provided. The passage says that the citation is used to point out a similarity between the cited work and the current paper, specifically regarding how the arthropod host governs bacterial assemblages. 

Looking at the definitions, the "Similar" class is when the citation highlights a similarity in results, patterns, phenomena, or observations. That fits because the passage mentions that the cited work supports the current findings about the arthropod host affecting bacterial communities.

Next, the "Support" class is when the citation confirms or supports the current work's findings. Since the cited study supports the current paper's results, "Support" is also appropriate, though slightly less specific than "Similar."

Lastly, "Neutral" is when the citation is mentioned without any specific argumentative intent. However, since the passage does use the citation to support their findings, "Neutral" might not be the best fit, but it's still possible if the mention is more descriptive without explicit support.

So, the top three would be "Similar" as the most appropriate, followed by "Support," and then "Neutral" as the least appropriate in this context.

1. Similar  
2. Support  
3. Neutral
