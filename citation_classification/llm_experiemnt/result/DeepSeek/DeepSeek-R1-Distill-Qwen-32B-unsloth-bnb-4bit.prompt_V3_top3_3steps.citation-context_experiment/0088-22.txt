Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by understanding the context. The passage mentions that the citation reports conflicting results about the multiplication rates and distribution of a phytoplasma strain in different plant species. The authors are pointing out that while some studies found high rates in young leaves and roots, others described conflicting results for a different phytoplasma strain in another plant.

Hmm, the general intent here seems to be comparing two studies. The authors are highlighting discrepancies between the cited works. So, this is a case where they're comparing the explanations or claims of two different studies. That makes me think of the CoCoXY category because it's about comparing cited studies with each other, not with the current paper.

Wait, but could it also be a comparison of results? Because they're talking about conflicting results between different studies. So CoCoRes might also apply since they're contrasting results from the cited works. But CoCoXY specifically refers to comparing explanations or claims, which fits because the authors are pointing out that the findings are conflicting, which relates to their explanations or claims about where the phytoplasma multiplies.

Is there a possibility of another category? Maybe Neutral, because they're just stating the conflicting results without necessarily supporting or criticizing either. But the main focus is on the comparison between the studies, so Neutral might be less relevant here.

So, the top three would likely be CoCoXY as the primary because it's about comparing the cited studies' claims. Then CoCoRes because it's about comparing results, and Neutral as a third possibility since they're presenting the information without a strong stance.

1. CoCoXY  
2. CoCoRes  
3. Neutral
