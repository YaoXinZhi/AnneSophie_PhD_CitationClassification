Alright, so I need to figure out the top three rhetorical classes for the citation marked @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by understanding the task.

First, I have to extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the citation discusses the multiplication rates and high concentration of two strains in infected daisy plants. It also notes conflicting results for another phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima. So, the citation is comparing results from different studies.

Next, I need to identify the general intent. The passage is comparing two studies, one showing high concentrations and the other conflicting results. This suggests a comparative intent, specifically looking at the results of different studies.

Now, looking at the predefined classes, CoCoRes is about comparing results, which fits here since the passage contrasts the findings of two studies. CoCoXY involves comparing explanations or claims between two cited works, which is also applicable because the passage is pointing out conflicting results between studies. Neutral might be a stretch, but since the citation is part of a descriptive comparison without necessarily supporting or criticizing, it could be considered neutral.

So, the top three classes would be CoCoRes, CoCoXY, and Neutral.

1. CoCoRes  
2. CoCoXY  
3. Neutral
