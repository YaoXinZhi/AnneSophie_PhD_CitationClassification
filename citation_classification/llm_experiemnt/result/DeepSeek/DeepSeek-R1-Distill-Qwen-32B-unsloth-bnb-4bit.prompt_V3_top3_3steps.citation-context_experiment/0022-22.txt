Okay, so I need to figure out the top three rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let's start by understanding the context. The passage is about plant health, specifically discussing the multiplication rates and concentration of two strains of 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' in infected daisy plants. It mentions conflicting results from another study on a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima.

First, I extract the context around the citation. The sentence is: "Fast multiplication rates and high concentration of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains have been reported in young developing leaves and roots of infected daisy plants (Wei et al., 2004; Saracco et al., 2006), although conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima @@CITATION@@."

The general intent here seems to be comparing two studies. The first part cites Wei et al. and Saracco et al., which report certain findings, while the second part uses @@CITATION@@ to mention conflicting results from another study. So the citation is being used to contrast two different studies.

Looking at the predefined classes, the most appropriate would be CoCoXY because it's comparing two cited studies with each other, not with the current paper. The passage is pointing out that while Wei and Saracco found high rates, the @@CITATION@@ study found conflicting results, which is a direct comparison between two cited works.

Next, the citation is also providing support for the idea that there are conflicting results. So Support might be the second class because it's backing up the claim about the conflicting findings.

Finally, the citation could be seen as part of a comparative context, so CoCoRes might be a third option, though it's more about comparing results between the current paper and others. But since the main comparison is between two cited studies, CoCoXY is more accurate.

So, the top three classes would be CoCoXY, Support, and CoCoRes.

1. CoCoXY  
2. Support  
3. CoCoRes
