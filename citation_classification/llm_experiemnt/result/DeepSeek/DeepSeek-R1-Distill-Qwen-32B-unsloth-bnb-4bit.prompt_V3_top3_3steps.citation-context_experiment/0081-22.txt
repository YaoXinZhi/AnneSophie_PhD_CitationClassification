Alright, I'm trying to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by understanding the context. The passage mentions a study that found a certain effect, and it references @@CITATION@@ to support this finding. 

Looking at the definitions, the citation is used to confirm the current work's results, which aligns with the 'Support' class. There's no comparison involved, so CoCoGM, CoCoRes, or CoCoXY don't fit. It's not about future research or motivation, so Future or Motivation are out. The citation isn't pointing out a weakness or similarity either, so Weakness and Similar aren't applicable. It's not a neutral mention but a supportive one. Usage and Basis also don't apply here. 

So, the top class is definitely Support. The other possible classes might be Neutral or Similar, but since it's explicitly supporting, those are less relevant. I'll rank them accordingly.

1. Support  
2. Neutral  
3. Similar
