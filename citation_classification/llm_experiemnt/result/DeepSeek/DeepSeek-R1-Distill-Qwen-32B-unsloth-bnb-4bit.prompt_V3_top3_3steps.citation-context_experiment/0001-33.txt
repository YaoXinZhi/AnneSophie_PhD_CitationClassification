Alright, I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. First, I need to extract the context around the citation to understand its purpose. The passage mentions that the citation discusses the multiplication rates and conflicting results regarding phytoplasma in different plant species. 

Next, I'll identify the general intent. The citation is comparing two studies that have conflicting results, so it's a comparative intent. Looking at the specific classes, CoCoXY fits because it's comparing two cited studies with each other. 

Then, I consider if there's any support or similarity. The passage supports the idea of conflicting results, so Support is another class. Lastly, since the citation is neutral in presenting these findings without directly supporting or criticizing, Neutral is also applicable. 

So, the top three classes are CoCoXY, Support, and Neutral.

1. CoCoXY  
2. Support  
3. Neutral
