Okay, I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. Let's go through the steps.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage says: "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@." So the context is about the spread of magnetic water treatment devices in the USA starting from 1975.

Next, I'll determine the general intent of the citation. The sentence is simply stating a fact about the spread of these devices without comparing, supporting, or criticizing anything. It's just providing background information.

Looking at the predefined classes, the most fitting one here is "Neutral" because the citation is used in a descriptive manner without any supporting, comparative, or critical intent. There's no comparison with other studies, no support for a claim, nor any motivation or future direction mentioned.

So, the top three classes would be Neutral as the most appropriate. Since the other classes don't fit here, I'll list them as Neutral, followed by the others, but since only three are needed, I'll just list Neutral as 1, and the rest as less relevant.

1. Neutral  
2. Basis  
3. Support
