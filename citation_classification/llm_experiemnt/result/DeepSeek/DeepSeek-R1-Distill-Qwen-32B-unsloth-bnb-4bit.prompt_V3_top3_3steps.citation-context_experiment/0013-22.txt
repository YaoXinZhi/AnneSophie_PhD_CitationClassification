Okay, I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation to understand its role. The passage mentions that the authors found high levels of a certain pathogen in symptomatic plants and compared their results with a previous study by @@CITATION@@. The previous study also reported similar levels in infected trees.

Next, I'll determine the general intent. Since the authors are comparing their results with those of another study, this seems like a comparison of results. 

Looking at the predefined classes, the most appropriate would be CoCoRes, which is for comparing results. 

Additionally, the citation points out a similarity in findings between the two studies, so Similar could be another relevant class. 

Lastly, since the citation is used to support the current findings, Support might also apply, but it's less direct than the comparison aspect.

So, the top three classes are CoCoRes, Similar, and Support.

1. CoCoRes  
2. Similar  
3. Support
