Alright, so I need to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by understanding the context.

The passage mentions that "The taxonomic status of these species is problematic and some may not develop on Pyrus @@CITATION@@." This suggests that the cited work has identified issues with the taxonomic classification of certain species, particularly their development on Pyrus.

Looking at the predefined classes, I need to determine which ones fit best. The sentence points out a weakness in the cited work by highlighting that the taxonomic status is problematic and some species may not develop as thought. This directly relates to the 'Weakness' class, which is used when the cited work's limitations or flaws are discussed.

Additionally, the citation is used to support the argument that there are issues with the taxonomic status. So, 'Support' is another relevant class because it's backing up the claim made in the current paper.

Lastly, the citation is neutral in the sense that it's providing information without necessarily comparing or motivating further action beyond pointing out the problem. So, 'Neutral' could also be applicable as it's a straightforward reference to the cited work's findings.

So, the top three classes would be:
1. Weakness (because it points out the problematic taxonomic status)
2. Support (as it supports the argument about the issues)
3. Neutral (since it's a descriptive reference to the cited work)
</think>

1. Weakness  
2. Support  
3. Neutral
