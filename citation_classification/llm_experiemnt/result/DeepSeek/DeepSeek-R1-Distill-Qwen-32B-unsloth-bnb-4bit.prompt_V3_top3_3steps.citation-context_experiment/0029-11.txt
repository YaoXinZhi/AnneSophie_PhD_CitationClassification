Okay, I need to determine the top three rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me start by extracting the context.

The context mentions that the citation is about a study showing the formation of hard calcite scale on surfaces exposed to hard water and how it can be prevented with a magnetic field. The current research aims to understand the mechanism behind this phenomenon. 

Next, I'll identify the general intent. The citation is used to justify why the current research is being conducted, pointing out that the mechanism isn't yet understood. This suggests the intent is Motivational.

Now, I'll rank the specific rhetorical classes. The primary class is Motivation because it's explaining the reason for the current study. Since the citation supports the need for the research, Support is the second. Lastly, the citation is also descriptive in presenting previous findings, so Neutral is third.

1. Motivation  
2. Support  
3. Neutral
