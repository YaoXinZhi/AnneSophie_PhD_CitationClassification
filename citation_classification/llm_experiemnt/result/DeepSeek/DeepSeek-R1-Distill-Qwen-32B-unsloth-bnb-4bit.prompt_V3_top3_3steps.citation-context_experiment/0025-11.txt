Okay, I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me go through the steps.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the citation points out conflicting results about a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima. So, the context is about conflicting results between two studies.

Next, I have to identify the general intent. Since the citation is comparing the results of two studies, it's a comparative intent. That narrows it down to CoCoGM, CoCoRes, or CoCoXY.

Looking at the definitions, CoCoXY is when two cited studies are compared with each other, not with the citing paper. In this case, the passage is comparing the results of Wei et al. and another study, so it's CoCoXY.

CoCoRes involves comparing results with the citing paper's results, but here it's comparing two other studies. So CoCoRes isn't the main one. However, since it's about results, it's a secondary fit.

Neutral might apply if the citation was just stating a fact without comparison, but since it's highlighting a conflict, it's more about comparison than a neutral statement.

So, the top three classes are CoCoXY, then CoCoRes, and Neutral as the least.

1. CoCoXY  
2. CoCoRes  
3. Neutral
