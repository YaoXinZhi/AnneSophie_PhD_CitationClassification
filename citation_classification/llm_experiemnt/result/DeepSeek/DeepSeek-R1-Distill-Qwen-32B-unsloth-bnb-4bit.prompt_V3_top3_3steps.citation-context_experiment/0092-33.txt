Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let's start by understanding the context.

The passage says that the citation is about the presence of 17Î²-estradiol in the environment. It mentions that the authors found the hormone in surface water and agricultural runoff. The current study detected it in two streams at concentrations up to 1.5 ng/L.

Now, looking at the context, the citation is being used to support the current findings. The authors are pointing out that others have found the same hormone in similar environments, which strengthens their own results. This seems like the citation is providing support for their work.

Next, the general intent. It's supportive because they're confirming their results with prior work. So the primary class would be Support.

Then, maybe they're also showing a similarity in findings, so Similar could be the second. Lastly, since it's just a reference without any critical analysis, Neutral might be the third.

So, the top three classes would be Support, Similar, and Neutral.

1. Support  
2. Similar  
3. Neutral
