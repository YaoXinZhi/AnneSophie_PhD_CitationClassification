Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific passage into the most appropriate rhetorical classes. First, I'll need to extract the context around the citation to understand its intent.

Looking at the context, it mentions that the citation is about the multiplication rates and conflicting results of phytoplasma in daisy plants and another study. The sentence structure suggests that the author is pointing out that while some studies report high rates, others have conflicting findings. This indicates a comparison between two cited studies, not necessarily with the current paper.

Next, I need to identify the general intent. Since the citation is comparing two studies, this falls under the Comparative category. Specifically, it's comparing explanations or claims between them, which aligns with CoCoXY.

Now, I'll rank the top three rhetorical classes. The primary class is CoCoXY because it directly compares two cited studies. The second could be Neutral, as the citation is presented descriptively without strong support or criticism. Lastly, Support might be a stretch if the comparison is meant to back up the current findings, but it's less likely than the first two.

1. CoCoXY  
2. Neutral  
3. Support
