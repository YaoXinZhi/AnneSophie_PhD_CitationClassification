Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by understanding the context. The passage says that the study by @@CITATION@@ found high levels of a specific pathogen in apple trees and its association with a disease. They also noted that the pathogen's diversity varies based on the host species. 

Hmm, the general intent here seems to be supporting the current study's findings. The citation is highlighting previous research that aligns with the current work, showing that the pathogen's presence and diversity are consistent with what's already been found. So, it's not just a neutral mention but actually backing up the current study's results.

Looking at the predefined classes, Support seems like the primary one because the citation is confirming the current findings. Next, Similar makes sense because it's pointing out that the cited work has similar observations about pathogen diversity and host association. Lastly, Basis could be a stretch because it's establishing a foundation, but the main focus is on supporting rather than just laying groundwork.

So, I think the top three classes are Support, Similar, and Basis.

1. Support  
2. Similar  
3. Basis
