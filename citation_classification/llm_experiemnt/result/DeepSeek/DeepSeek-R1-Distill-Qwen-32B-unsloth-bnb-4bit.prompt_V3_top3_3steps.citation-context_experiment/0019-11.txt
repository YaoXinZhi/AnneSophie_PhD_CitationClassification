Alright, so I need to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let's start by extracting the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the study by @@CITATION@@ reports on the multiplication rates of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains in young leaves and roots of daisy plants. It also notes conflicting results for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima, citing another study.

Next, I need to identify the general intent. The context is comparing results from different studies. The first part supports the findings of high multiplication rates, while the second part points out conflicting results. This suggests a comparison between studies, specifically their results.

Looking at the predefined classes, the most appropriate would be CoCoRes because it's comparing results directly. Then, CoCoXY since it's comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies. Lastly, Support might be relevant as the first part supports the findings, but the primary intent is comparison.

1. CoCoRes  
2. CoCoXY  
3. Support
