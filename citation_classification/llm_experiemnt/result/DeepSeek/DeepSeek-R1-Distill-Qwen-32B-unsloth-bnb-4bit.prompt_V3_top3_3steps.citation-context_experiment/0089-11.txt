Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me start by extracting the context.

The passage says: "Previous studies have shown that the application of magnetic fields can influence the crystallization process of calcium carbonate in hard water systems @@CITATION@@. This has led to the hypothesis that magnetic treatment might prevent the formation of hard scale deposits in industrial water systems."

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. It mentions that previous studies have shown the influence of magnetic fields on crystallization, which led to a hypothesis about preventing scale deposits.

Next, I need to determine the general intent. The citation is referring to previous studies that provided foundational knowledge, which supports the current hypothesis. So the intent is Foundational.

Looking at the predefined classes, Foundational corresponds to Basis. The citation is used to establish the basis for the current research by referencing prior work.

Now, I'll rank the top three rhetorical classes. The primary class is Basis because it's foundational. There's no comparison mentioned, so CoCo classes aren't applicable. The citation isn't used to support the current finding directly but sets the stage, so Support might be a secondary class. Motivation could also be considered since it's part of why the current research is being done.

So the top three are Basis, Motivation, and Support.

1. Basis  
2. Motivation  
3. Support
