Okay, so I need to figure out the top three rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me start by understanding the context.

The passage mentions that the study's findings are supported by previous research. The citation is used to back up their results. So, the general intent here is to support the current work.

Looking at the definitions, Support is when the citation confirms the authors' findings. That fits perfectly here. Next, they might also be pointing out a similarity in results, so Similar could be second. Lastly, if the previous work is foundational, Basis might be third, but since it's more about supporting, Basis is less likely. So the top three are Support, Similar, and Basis.

1. Support  
2. Similar  
3. Basis
