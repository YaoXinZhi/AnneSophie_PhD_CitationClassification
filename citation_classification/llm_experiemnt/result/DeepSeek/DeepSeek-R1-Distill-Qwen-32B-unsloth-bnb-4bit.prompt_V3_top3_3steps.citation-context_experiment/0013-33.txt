Okay, so I need to figure out the top three rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by understanding the context. The passage mentions that the citation discusses the multiplication rates and conflicting results of a phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima. 

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. It says that conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima @@CITATION@@. This suggests that the authors are pointing out discrepancies between studies.

Next, I'll identify the general intent. Since the citation is used to compare conflicting results from different studies, it's a comparative context. Specifically, they're contrasting two studies regarding their findings on phytoplasma.

Now, looking at the predefined classes, CoCoXY is about comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies, which fits here because the authors are highlighting conflicting results from two different studies. So CoCoXY is the most appropriate.

Then, the passage is pointing out a similarity in the topic being studied—phytoplasma in Euphorbia—but the focus is more on the conflict rather than just similarity. So Similar might be a secondary class, but it's not as strong as CoCoXY.

Lastly, the citation isn't used to support their own work or methods, so Support isn't applicable. It's more about the comparison than anything else. So the third might be Neutral, as it's a factual mention without supporting or motivating the current study.

So the top three are CoCoXY, Similar, and Neutral.

1. CoCoXY  
2. Similar  
3. Neutral
