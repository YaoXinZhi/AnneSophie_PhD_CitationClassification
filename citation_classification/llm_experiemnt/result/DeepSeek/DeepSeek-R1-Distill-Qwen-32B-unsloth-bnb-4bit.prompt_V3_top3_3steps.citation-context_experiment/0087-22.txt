Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage says, "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@@."

Looking at this, the authors are talking about their own finding that insect hosts influence bacterial community assembly. They mention that this is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations, specifically citing another study that looked at fleas and ticks. The cited study found that arthropod hosts governed bacterial assemblages, not rodent hosts or environmental conditions.

Next, I need to identify the general intent of the citation. The authors are using the cited work to back up their own findings. They mention that their finding is "supported by" recent investigations, which clearly indicates that the citation is used to support their results. So the general intent is supportive.

Now, looking at the predefined rhetorical classes, the most appropriate would be 'Support' because the citation is directly backing up their results. But let me check if there's another possible class. The example given for 'Support' is exactly this kind of situation where previous research is cited to confirm the current findings. 

Is there a possibility of another class? Well, 'Similar' is about pointing out similarities between studies, but here it's more about support rather than just similarity. 'CoCoRes' is about comparing results, but in this case, the authors are not contrasting or comparing; they're just supporting their results with another study. 

So, the top three classes would be 'Support' as the most appropriate, followed by 'Similar' because it's a related study, and then maybe 'Neutral' if there's a chance it's just a descriptive mention without a strong supporting intent. But I think 'Support' is the primary, 'Similar' as secondary, and 'Neutral' as a lesser possibility.

1. Support  
2. Similar  
3. Neutral
