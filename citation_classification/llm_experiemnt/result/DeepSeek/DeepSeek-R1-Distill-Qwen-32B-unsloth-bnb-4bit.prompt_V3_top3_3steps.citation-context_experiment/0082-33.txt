Okay, I need to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by understanding the context.

The passage mentions that the citation describes the use of magnetic fields to prevent scale formation on surfaces exposed to hard water. It's part of a motivation where the current research is trying to explain the mechanism behind this phenomenon. 

So, the citation is used to justify why this current research is being conducted. It identifies a knowledge gapâ€”the mechanism isn't yet understood. That points towards the Motivation class. 

Next, the passage also states that the previous research showed successful prevention, which the current work builds upon. This could imply that the citation is supporting the current study's foundation, so Basis might be another class. 

Alternatively, the citation is used to set up the reason for the current study, which is more about motivation than just providing a basis. But since it's also referencing prior work that the current study is building on, Basis is still relevant. 

I don't see any comparison, support, or usage here. The main intent is to motivate the current research by highlighting a gap. So, the top three would likely be Motivation, Basis, and maybe Neutral if it's just a factual reference, but since it's part of the motivation, Neutral might not be the best fit. 

Wait, perhaps Neutral isn't necessary here. The passage is clearly using the citation to set up the motivation, so the top classes are Motivation and Basis. If I have to pick three, maybe add Support as a third, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, Neutral might be third if it's just a neutral mention. 

But considering the definitions, the primary intent is Motivation, then Basis, and perhaps Neutral as the least. So, I'll rank them accordingly.

1. Motivation  
2. Basis  
3. Neutral
