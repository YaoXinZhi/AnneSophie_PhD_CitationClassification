Okay, so I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage into the top three rhetorical classes. Let's go through the steps.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage says: "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@@."

Looking at this, the authors are talking about their finding that insect hosts influence bacterial communities. They mention that this is supported by recent studies on other insect-associated bacteria. The citation is pointing out that in fleas and ticks, the host governs bacterial assemblages, while other factors don't. 

Now, identifying the general intent. The citation is being used to back up their finding, so it's supportive. It's not foundational, comparative, or motivational. It's not about future work, usage, or weakness. It's supporting their own results.

Next, looking at the specific classes. The main one here is Support because they're using the citation to confirm their results. There's also a Similar class because the cited work shows a similar pattern in different insects. Neutral might be third because the citation is descriptive but in this context, it's more about supporting than being neutral.

So the top three would be Support, Similar, then Neutral.

1. Support  
2. Similar  
3. Neutral
