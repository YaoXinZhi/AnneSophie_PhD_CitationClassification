Okay, so I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage into the top three rhetorical classes. Let me start by understanding the context and the task.

First, I'll extract the context around @@CITATION@@. The passage says, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." 

Now, looking at the context, the sentence is comparing the results of the current study with previous experiments. The key here is "substantially differ from the results of the experiments," which indicates a comparison of findings.

Next, I'll identify the general intent. Since the citation is used to compare results, it falls under the Comparative category. Specifically, it's about comparing results, so CoCoRes seems appropriate.

Then, I'll rank the top three rhetorical classes. The most appropriate is CoCoRes because it's directly comparing results. The next could be Neutral if the citation is just stating the difference without any support or criticism. Alternatively, it might be CoCoXY if it's comparing two studies, but since it's comparing the current paper's results with the cited one, CoCoRes is primary. So, the top three would be CoCoRes, Neutral, and maybe Support if it's confirming something, but I think Neutral is more accurate here because it's just stating a difference without support or criticism.

1. CoCoRes  
2. Neutral  
3. Support
