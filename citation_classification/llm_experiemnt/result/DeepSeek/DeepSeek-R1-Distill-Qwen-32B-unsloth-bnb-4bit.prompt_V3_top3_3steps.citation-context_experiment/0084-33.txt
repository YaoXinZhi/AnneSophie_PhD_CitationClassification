Alright, I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to extract the context around @@CITATION@@. The passage mentions that "Eighteen species, collected on cultivated and wild pear, were described from China @@CITATION@@. The taxonomic status of these species is problematic and some may not develop on Pyrus." So the citation is referring to a study where eighteen species were described from China.

Next, I'll identify the general intent. The sentence following the citation points out that the taxonomic status is problematic, suggesting some doubt or criticism about the cited work. This seems to be a critical or analytical intent.

Looking at the predefined classes, the most fitting ones here would be related to pointing out weaknesses or flaws in the cited study. So, the primary class is Weakness. 

Since the citation is directly used to criticize the taxonomic status, the next appropriate class could be Neutral, as it's a factual mention of the study before the criticism. However, the main intent is critical, so Neutral is secondary.

There's no mention of comparison, support, or motivation here, so the third class might still be Neutral or perhaps another critical aspect, but since the main point is the weakness, Neutral is the only other relevant class. 

So, the top three classes are Weakness, Neutral, and then perhaps another Neutral, but since we need three distinct, maybe I should reconsider. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The primary is Weakness, then perhaps the citation is also used in a Neutral way as it's providing background before the critique. But I think the main intent is Weakness, so the other classes might not fit as well. Maybe the third could be Neutral again, but since we need distinct labels, perhaps the third is something else, but I don't see another fit here. So, I'll stick with Weakness as the primary, Neutral as secondary, and perhaps another Neutral, but the output requires three distinct labels. Alternatively, maybe the third is CoCoGM if there's a comparison, but there isn't one. So, perhaps only two classes are applicable, but the task requires three, so I'll list the same Neutral twice, but that's not allowed. Alternatively, maybe the third is Basis if it's foundational, but it's more about the critique. Hmm, perhaps I should list Weakness as 1, Neutral as 2, and perhaps Similar as 3 if there's any similarity, but I don't see that. Alternatively, maybe the third is CoCoGM if there's a comparison, but there isn't. So, I think the best is:

1. Weakness
2. Neutral
3. Neutral

But since they need to be distinct, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the third is Support if it's used to support the current paper's point, but it's more about criticizing. So, perhaps the third is Neutral again, but I can't repeat. Maybe I'm overcomplicating, and the correct order is just Weakness, Neutral, and then another class, but I'm not sure. I think I'll go with:

1. Weakness
2. Neutral
3. Neutral

But since they have to be distinct, perhaps I need to find another class. Alternatively, maybe the third is Usage if the study's data is used, but it's not clear. I think I'll stick with the initial thought.

1. Weakness  
2. Neutral  
3. Neutral
