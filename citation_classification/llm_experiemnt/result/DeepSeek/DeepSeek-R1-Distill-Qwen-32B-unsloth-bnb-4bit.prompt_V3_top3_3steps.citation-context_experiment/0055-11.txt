Alright, I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. First, I'll extract the context. The passage mentions that the citation discusses the multiplication rates and conflicting results of a phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima. 

Next, I'll identify the general intent. The citation is comparing conflicting results between two studies, not directly with the current paper. So, it's a comparison between two cited works.

Now, I'll map this to the rhetorical classes. CoCoXY is about comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies. That's the primary class. The passage doesn't support or contrast with the current paper's findings, so Support isn't the main point. It's also not a direct comparison of results with the current study, so CoCoRes isn't the first choice. 

So, the top three classes are CoCoXY, then maybe Support if there's a slight backing, but since it's more about comparison, Neutral could be third if there's no clear support or weakness.

1. CoCoXY  
2. Support  
3. Neutral
