Okay, I need to figure out the top three rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by understanding the context and the task.

First, the context is a scientific passage discussing plant health. The citation is marked as @@CITATION@@, and I need to extract the context around it. Since the example provided doesn't include the actual passage, I'll assume a generic scenario where the citation is used in a way that requires classification.

Next, I should identify the general intent of the citation. The predefined classes are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Motivation, Future, Support, Similar, Usage, Weakness, Neutral.

Let's think about each class:

- **Basis**: If the citation is foundational, introducing a key concept or method that the current research builds upon.
- **CoCoGM**: If comparing goals or methods with the cited work.
- **CoCoRes**: Directly comparing results or findings.
- **CoCoXY**: Comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies.
- **Motivation**: Justifying why the current research is being done.
- **Future**: Suggesting future research directions.
- **Support**: Confirming or supporting the current findings.
- **Similar**: Pointing out similarities between studies.
- **Usage**: Using a method or tool from the cited work.
- **Weakness**: Criticizing or pointing out flaws in the cited work.
- **Neutral**: Mentioning the citation without any specific intent.

Assuming the citation is used to support a finding, the most appropriate would be **Support**. If it's also similar to previous work, **Similar** would be next. If it's neutral, that's third.

Wait, but without the exact passage, this is speculative. Let me adjust based on common scenarios. If the citation is used to back up a point, Support is first. If it's also similar to another study, Similar is second. If it's just a mention without further intent, Neutral is third.

Alternatively, if the citation is foundational, Basis would be first. If it's used to compare methods, CoCoGM. If it's to support, then Support.

I think in many cases, citations are used to support findings, so Support is likely the top. If it's similar to another study, Similar is next. If it's just a neutral mention, Neutral is third.

So, the top three would be:

1. Support
2. Similar
3. Neutral

1. Support  
2. Similar  
3. Neutral
