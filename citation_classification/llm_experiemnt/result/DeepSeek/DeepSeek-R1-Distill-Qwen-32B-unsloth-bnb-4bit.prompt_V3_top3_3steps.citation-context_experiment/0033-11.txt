Okay, so I need to figure out the top three rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by understanding the context.

The passage mentions that the study of plant health is influenced by factors like soil quality and pest control. It then cites @@CITATION@@ to support this statement. 

First, I'll extract the context. The sentence is: "Factors such as soil quality and pest control are critical in determining plant health, as demonstrated by @@CITATION@@." The citation is used to back up the claim about the importance of these factors.

Next, I need to determine the general intent. Since the citation is used to support the claim, it's likely a supportive intent. Looking at the predefined classes, Support is a direct match here because the citation is confirming the assertion.

Now, ranking the classes. The primary class is Support because it's explicitly used to back up the statement. The second might be Similar if the cited work discusses similar factors, but the passage doesn't mention that. Alternatively, Neutral is possible if the citation is just a factual reference without any comparative or critical analysis. The third could be Basis if the cited work is foundational, but the passage doesn't indicate that. So, the top three are Support, Neutral, and Similar.

1. Support  
2. Neutral  
3. Similar
