Okay, I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific passage into the top three rhetorical classes. Let me start by understanding the context and the task.

First, I'll extract the context discussing the citation. The passage mentions that the citation is used to support the current findings by referencing a previous study. The example provided is about a study that showed similar results regarding the influence of magnetic fields on scale formation.

Next, I need to identify the general intent of the citation. Since the citation is supporting the current work by referencing a previous study that found similar results, the intent seems to be supportive.

Looking at the predefined classes, "Support" is the most appropriate because the citation is confirming the work of the current authors. "Similar" is the next because the cited work shows similar findings, indicating a similarity in results. Lastly, "Basis" could be considered as it's referencing foundational work, but it's less direct than the first two.

So, the top three classes are Support, Similar, and Basis.

1. Support  
2. Similar  
3. Basis
