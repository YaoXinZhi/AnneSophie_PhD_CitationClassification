Alright, let's tackle this classification task. I need to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. 

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the study by @@CITATION@@ found that certain plant species are resistant to a specific pathogen. The current paper builds on this by testing additional species. 

Next, I'll identify the general intent. The citation is being used to establish a foundation for the current research, showing that previous work identified resistant species. This points towards a foundational intent, which is "Basis."

Now, I'll consider the specific rhetorical classes. Since the current study is expanding on the cited work, it's using the citation to support their own research, so "Support" is relevant. Also, the current paper is similar in methodology or goals, so "Similar" fits. Lastly, it's not directly comparing results but rather building upon them, so "CoCoGM" (comparison of goals or methods) is a stretch but possible.

So, the top three classes would be Basis, Support, and Similar.

1. Basis  
2. Support  
3. Similar
