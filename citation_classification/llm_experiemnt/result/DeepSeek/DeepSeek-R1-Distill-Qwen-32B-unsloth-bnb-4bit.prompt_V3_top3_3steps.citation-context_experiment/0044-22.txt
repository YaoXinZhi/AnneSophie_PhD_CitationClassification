Alright, I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific passage into the top three rhetorical classes. Let's start by extracting the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the citation discusses the multiplication rates and conflicting results of a phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima. 

Next, I'll identify the general intent. The citation is comparing two studies: one that reports high multiplication rates and another that describes conflicting results. This indicates a comparative intent, specifically contrasting results from different studies.

Now, looking at the predefined classes, the most appropriate would be CoCoXY because it's comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies. CoCoRes is next since it's about comparing results. Lastly, Neutral could apply as it's a descriptive comparison without necessarily supporting or opposing either study.

So, the top three classes are CoCoXY, CoCoRes, and Neutral.

3. Neutral
