Alright, I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage into the top three rhetorical classes. Let's start by understanding the context and the intent of the citation.

Looking at the passage, it discusses the presence of a specific strain in a plant species. The sentence is: "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@@."

First, I extract the context around the citation. The main point here is that the authors' findings are supported by other studies. They mention that their results are consistent with recent cross-taxon investigations, specifically pointing out that in fleas and ticks, the arthropod host influenced bacterial communities, unlike rodent hosts or environmental factors.

Next, identifying the general intent: The citation is used to back up the authors' findings, showing that their results align with existing research. This suggests a supportive intent.

Now, mapping this to the predefined classes. The most appropriate is Support, as the citation directly supports their results. Since the citation is comparing their findings with another study's results, CoCoRes could be second. Neutral might be third because the citation is presented in a factual manner without strong comparison or criticism.

So, the top three classes are Support, CoCoRes, and Neutral.

1. Support  
2. CoCoRes  
3. Neutral
