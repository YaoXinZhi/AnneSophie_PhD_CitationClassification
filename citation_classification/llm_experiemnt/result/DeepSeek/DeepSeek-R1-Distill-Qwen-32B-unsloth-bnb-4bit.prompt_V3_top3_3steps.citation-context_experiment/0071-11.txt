Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by understanding the context.

The passage says, "Our previous research @@CITATION@@ has shown that the formation of the hard calcite scale on the surfaces exposed to hard water can be successfully prevented with the applied magnetic field." It then mentions that the explanation is not yet offered, and the purpose is to understand the mechanism.

Step 1: Extract the context. The citation is about a previous study that showed magnetic fields can prevent calcite scale formation. The current study is trying to explain why that happens.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation is used to justify why the current research is being done. It points out a knowledge gap because the previous study didn't explain the mechanism, so the current work is motivated by that.

Step 3: Assign rhetorical classes. The main class is Motivation because it's explaining why the current study is necessary. It's not a comparison, support, or usage. So, the top class is Motivation. Next, maybe Neutral because it's a factual statement about the previous work. Lastly, Basis might be considered since it's foundational, but it's more about motivation than foundation. So the top three are Motivation, Neutral, Basis.

1. Motivation  
2. Neutral  
3. Basis
