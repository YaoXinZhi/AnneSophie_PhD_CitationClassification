Alright, I need to determine the top three rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me start by carefully reading the passage and understanding how the citation is used.

The passage mentions that the study of plant pathogenic bacteria has advanced with the use of molecular tools, and it specifically cites a work by Jones et al. (2008) as an example of this advancement. The context is discussing how these tools have contributed to the field.

First, I'll extract the context. The sentence is: "The study of plant pathogenic bacteria has advanced with the use of molecular tools, for example, Jones et al. (2008) used a combination of PCR and sequencing to identify pathogens in infected plants."

Next, I'll identify the general intent. The citation is used to provide an example of how molecular tools have been applied, supporting the statement about advancements. This suggests the citation is used to support the current work's point.

Looking at the predefined classes, Support seems appropriate because the citation is used to confirm or illustrate a method that contributes to the research. Usage could also be considered since the example shows the application of specific methods. However, the primary intent is to support the argument about advancements, not just describe usage.

CoCoRes might be a stretch if the paper is comparing results, but the passage doesn't explicitly compare results with another study. It's more about showing an example of a method used. Therefore, Support is more fitting than CoCoRes.

Neutral is less likely because the citation is actively contributing to the argument, not just stating a fact without further implication.

So, the top three classes would be Support as the primary, Usage as secondary since it's about method application, and Neutral as a possible third, though it's less fitting.

1. Support  
2. Usage  
3. Neutral
