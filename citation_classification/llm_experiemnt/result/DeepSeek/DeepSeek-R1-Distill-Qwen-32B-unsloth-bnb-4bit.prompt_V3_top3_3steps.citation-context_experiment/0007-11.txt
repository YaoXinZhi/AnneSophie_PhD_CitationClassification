Okay, I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the citation describes how a specific strain of phytoplasma affects daisy plants, noting conflicting results with another study. 

Next, I identify the general intent. The citation is comparing two studies, highlighting that one found high concentrations while the other had conflicting results. This is a comparison between two cited works, not with the current paper.

Now, I match this to the rhetorical classes. The most appropriate is CoCoXY because it's comparing explanations or claims from two studies. CoCoRes is next since it's about comparing results. Lastly, Neutral could apply because the citation is descriptive without supporting or opposing the current work.

1. CoCoXY  
2. CoCoRes  
3. Neutral
