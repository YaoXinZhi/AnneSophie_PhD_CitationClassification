Alright, I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the authors are studying the effects of a magnetic field on calcite scale formation and that they built upon previous research which showed the prevention of scale formation. They cite @@CITATION@@ for their previous work. 

Now, looking at the general intent. The citation is used to show that the current research builds on prior findings. This seems foundational because they're referencing their own earlier work as the basis for their current study. 

Next, I need to assign the top three rhetorical classes. The primary class here is Basis because they're establishing their research foundation. There's also a bit of Similarity since they're pointing out that their new study is related to their past work. Usage might come into play if they're using the same methods, but it's less clear. So, the top three are Basis, Similar, and Usage.

1. Basis  
2. Similar  
3. Usage
