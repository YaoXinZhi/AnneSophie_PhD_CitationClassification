Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by extracting the context around the citation. The passage says, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@."

Hmm, so the main point here is that the current study's results are different from the cited work's results. The authors are pointing out a discrepancy between their findings and those of the cited study. 

Looking at the predefined classes, this seems to be a comparison of results. The example given for CoCoRes is exactly this kind of scenario where two sets of results are compared. So CoCoRes is definitely the top choice here.

Next, I should consider if there's another class that might fit. Since the authors are contrasting their results with another study, it's not just a simple support or usage. It's more about the comparison of findings. Could it be CoCoXY? Well, CoCoXY is when two cited studies are compared, but here it's the current paper's results against the cited one, so it's more CoCoRes than CoCoXY.

Is there any other class that might apply? Maybe Neutral, but the comparison here is more about the contrast rather than a neutral mention. So Neutral is probably not the best fit.

So the top three would be CoCoRes as the primary, followed by maybe CoCoXY if considering comparison in a broader sense, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, Neutral could be third if it's a stretch. But I think the main one is CoCoRes, and the others might not fit as well.

1. CoCoRes  
2. CoCoXY  
3. Neutral
