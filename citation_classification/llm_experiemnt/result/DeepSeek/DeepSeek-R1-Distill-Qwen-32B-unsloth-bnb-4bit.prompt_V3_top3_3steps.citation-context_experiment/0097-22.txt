Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by understanding the context. The passage mentions that the citation is used to compare or contrast two studies regarding the multiplication rates and conflicting results in different plants. 

Looking at the definitions, the citation is comparing two studies, not the current paper with another. That makes me think of CoCoXY because it's about comparing explanations or claims between two cited works. 

Next, the passage highlights conflicting results, which suggests that the citation is pointing out a similarity in the type of results or phenomena observed. So, Similar might also be applicable here.

Lastly, the citation is providing support by showing that other studies have found varying results, which could back up the current findings or context. So, Support could be another class.

I'm not sure if there's a better fit than these, but these three seem to cover the comparison, similarity, and support aspects of the citation.

1. CoCoXY  
2. Similar  
3. Support
