Okay, so I need to figure out the top three rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let's start by understanding the context. The passage is about plant health, specifically discussing a study on aphid gut peptides interfering with virus uptake. The authors mention that this peptide also binds to other aphid species, suggesting broader applicability.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The sentence is: "Similarly, a small aphid gut binding peptide was shown to interfere with enamovirus uptake from pea aphid gut into the hemocoel; the peptide also bound to gut epithelia of two other aphid species suggesting potential broader applicability @@CITATION@@."

Looking at the context, the citation is supporting the idea that the peptide's effect isn't limited to one species. The authors are using this to suggest that their findings might apply more widely. This seems to be pointing towards future research directions because they're hinting that this peptide could have broader applications beyond what's been studied so far.

Next, I need to identify the general intent. The citation is used to suggest potential future applications, which aligns with the "Future" category. It's not comparing results or methods directly with their own study, so it's not CoCoRes or CoCoGM. They're not supporting their own findings with this citation, so it's not Support. It's more about implying where this research could lead next.

So, the primary class is Future. Then, considering other possible classes, maybe Support because it's backing up the idea of broader applicability. But I think Future is more precise here. The third might be Neutral if it's just providing information without a strong direction, but I'm leaning more towards Future being the main one, followed by Support, and perhaps Neutral as a third option if needed.

1. Future  
2. Support  
3. Neutral
