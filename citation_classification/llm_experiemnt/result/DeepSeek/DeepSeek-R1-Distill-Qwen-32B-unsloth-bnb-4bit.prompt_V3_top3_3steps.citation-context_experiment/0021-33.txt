Alright, I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the citation describes how a specific phytoplasma strain was reported to have fast multiplication rates and high concentration in certain parts of infected plants. However, it also notes conflicting results from another study. So, the citation is being used to highlight a point of comparison between two studies.

Next, I should identify the general intent. The citation is comparing results from different studies, pointing out that while some reports show high concentrations, others describe conflicting findings. This seems to be a comparison of results, which falls under the Comparative category.

Now, looking at the specific rhetorical classes, CoCoRes is about comparing results directly. Since the citation is contrasting results from different studies, CoCoRes is the most appropriate. 

CoCoXY deals with comparing explanations or claims, which could also fit since the conflicting results are different claims. However, since the focus is on the results themselves, CoCoRes is more precise.

Lastly, Neutral might apply if the citation were just providing information without comparison. But since it's used to show a discrepancy, Neutral isn't the primary intent here.

So, the top three classes are CoCoRes, CoCoXY, and Neutral.

1. CoCoRes  
2. CoCoXY  
3. Neutral
