Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by extracting the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the citation shows conflicting results regarding the multiplication rates and concentration of 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains in different plant parts. 

Next, I'll identify the general intent. The citation is comparing two studies: one that reports high rates in young leaves and roots, and another that describes conflicting results for a different phytoplasma in Euphorbia. This seems like a comparison between two cited works, not directly with the current paper's methods or results.

Looking at the predefined classes, the most appropriate would be CoCoXY because it's comparing explanations or claims between two studies. The second might be Support if it's backing up a point, but since it's comparing, it's more about contrast. Third could be Neutral if it's just stating the findings without a specific argument.

1. CoCoXY  
2. Support  
3. Neutral
