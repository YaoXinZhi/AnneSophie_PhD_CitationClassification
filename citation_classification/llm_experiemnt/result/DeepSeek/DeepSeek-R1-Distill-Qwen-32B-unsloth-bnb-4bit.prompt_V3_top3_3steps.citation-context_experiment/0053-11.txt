Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let's start by understanding the context.

The passage is about the effect of magnetic treatment on the growth of calcite scale. It mentions that previous research by @@CITATION@@ showed that magnetic fields can prevent scale formation. The current study aims to understand the mechanism behind this phenomenon.

First, I should extract the context around the citation. The sentence says, "Our previous research @@CITATION@@ has shown that the formation of the hard calcite scale on the surfaces exposed to hard water can be successfully prevented with the applied magnetic field. The explanation of the phenomena is not yet offered and the purpose of this work is to try to understand the mechanism of the beneficial influence of the magnetic treatment."

Now, identifying the general intent. The citation is used to justify why this current research is being conducted. It points out that while previous work showed the effect, the mechanism isn't understood, hence motivating the current study. So, the general intent is Motivational.

Next, looking at the predefined classes. The Motivational category includes Motivation and Future. Since the citation is used to explain the reason behind the current research, Motivation is the primary class. Future isn't applicable here because it's not suggesting future directions but explaining the current study's purpose.

Since the citation is foundational to the current research, Basis could also be considered, but the main intent is motivational. Support might be a stretch if the citation supports the current work's premise, but the primary use is to motivate the research.

So, the top three classes would be Motivation first, then Basis, and maybe Support as a third, but I'm not entirely sure if Support fits here. Alternatively, if the citation is just stating a fact without necessarily supporting the current work's results, Neutral could be considered, but that's less likely.

Wait, perhaps the citation is more about setting the stage for the current work, so Motivation is the main, followed by Basis because it's foundational, and then maybe Neutral if it's just stating a previous finding without comparison or support.

Alternatively, if the citation is used to support the current study's premise, then Support could be third. But I think the primary is Motivation, then Basis, and maybe Neutral.

Hmm, maybe I should reconsider. The passage uses the citation to show that previous research has shown an effect, thus motivating the current study to understand the mechanism. So, it's definitely Motivation. Basis might also apply because it's the foundation. The third could be Support if the citation is backing up the current study's premise, but it's more about motivation than support.

Alternatively, if the citation is just stating a fact without directly supporting the current findings, Neutral could be third. But I think Support is more appropriate here because the citation supports the idea that magnetic treatment works, which is the premise of the current study.

So, final order: 1. Motivation, 2. Basis, 3. Support.

1. Motivation  
2. Basis  
3. Support
