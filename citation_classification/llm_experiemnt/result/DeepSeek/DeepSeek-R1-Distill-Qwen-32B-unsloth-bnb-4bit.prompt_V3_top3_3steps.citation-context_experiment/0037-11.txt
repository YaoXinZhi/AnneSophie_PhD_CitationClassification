Okay, so I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage into the top three rhetorical classes. Let me start by understanding the context. The passage says that the authors used a method described in @@CITATION@@ to analyze the impact of a new agricultural technique on crop yields. 

First, I'll extract the context. The key part is that the method was used, which suggests it's a tool or approach from the cited work. 

Next, identifying the general intent. Since they're using a specific method from the cited work, this seems like they're referencing a tool or technique. That points towards 'Usage' because they're directly using something from the cited paper.

Looking at the predefined classes, 'Usage' fits because they're using the method. There's no comparison involved, so CoCo classes might not apply. They're not supporting their results with the citation, so 'Support' isn't the main intent. They're not pointing out a weakness or similarity either. 

So, the top class is definitely 'Usage'. The next possible could be 'Support' if they're using the method to confirm their results, but it's more about usage than support. 'Neutral' might come next if the citation is just a mention without any specific intent beyond using the method. 

Wait, but 'Neutral' is when the citation is descriptive without any specific argument. Here, they are using the method, so 'Usage' is primary, 'Support' is secondary if the method's use supports their findings, and 'Neutral' third if it's just a neutral mention. 

Hmm, I'm a bit confused between 'Support' and 'Usage'. Since they're using the method, 'Usage' is the main class. If the citation is also to support their approach, then 'Support' would be second. But if it's just a tool without necessarily supporting their results, 'Neutral' might be second. 

I think 'Usage' is first, 'Support' second, and 'Neutral' third. Alternatively, if the citation is just a reference to the method without supporting their findings, 'Neutral' could be second. But since they're using it in their study, 'Support' is more likely. 

Wait, no, 'Support' is when the citation is used to confirm their findings. Here, it's more about using the method, so 'Usage' is first, 'Support' might not apply. Maybe 'Neutral' is second if it's just a mention. But I'm not entirely sure. 

I think the best order is 1. Usage, 2. Support, 3. Neutral. Because they're using the method, which supports their work, even if it's not explicitly stated.

1. Usage  
2. Support  
3. Neutral
