Okay, I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. Let me start by understanding the context.

The passage mentions that the citation describes how fast multiplication rates and high concentrations of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains have been reported in infected daisy plants. It also notes conflicting results for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima.

Looking at the context, the authors are comparing two studies: one where high concentrations were found in daisy plants, and another where conflicting results were observed in a different plant. The citation is used to highlight these conflicting findings between the two studies.

Now, I need to determine the general intent. Since the citation is comparing two cited studies with each other, not with the current paper, this falls under a comparative intent. Specifically, it's a comparison of explanations or claims, which is the CoCoXY class.

Next, I should rank the top three rhetorical classes. The primary class is definitely CoCoXY because it's about comparing two studies' results. The second could be Neutral since the citation is providing factual information without directly supporting or opposing the current paper. Third, it might also be considered as Support if it's used to back up a point about conflicting results, but CoCoXY is the most accurate.

So, the top three are CoCoXY, Neutral, and Support.

1. CoCoXY  
2. Neutral  
3. Support
