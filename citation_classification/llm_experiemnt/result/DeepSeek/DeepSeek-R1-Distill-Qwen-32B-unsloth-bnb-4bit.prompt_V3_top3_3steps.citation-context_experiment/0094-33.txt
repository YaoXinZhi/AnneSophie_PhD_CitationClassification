Okay, I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let's start by understanding the context. The passage says that the study by @@CITATION@@ found that certain plant pathogens can cause discoloration in leaves. The current paper is discussing similar findings in their own experiments. 

So, the first step is to extract the context. The key point is that both studies observed discoloration caused by plant pathogens. This suggests a similarity in results.

Next, identifying the general intent. Since the current paper is pointing out that their findings are similar to the cited work, the intent is supportive or similar. It's not foundational, comparative, or motivational. It's more about aligning results.

Looking at the predefined classes, 'Similar' seems the most appropriate because the citation is highlighting a similarity in findings. Then, 'Support' might be next because the cited work supports the current paper's results. 'Neutral' could be third if the citation is just mentioning the fact without explicitly supporting or comparing. 

So, the top three classes would be Similar, Support, and Neutral.

1. Similar  
2. Support  
3. Neutral
