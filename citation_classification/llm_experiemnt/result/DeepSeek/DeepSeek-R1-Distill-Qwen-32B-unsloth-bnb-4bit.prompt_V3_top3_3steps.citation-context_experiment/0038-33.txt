Alright, I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific passage into the top three rhetorical classes. Let's go through the steps carefully.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the citation reports on the multiplication rates and concentration of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains in young leaves and roots. It also notes conflicting results for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima. 

Next, I'll identify the general intent. The citation is comparing results from different studies. The first part reports high multiplication rates, while the second part mentions conflicting results. This suggests a comparison between two cited studies, not directly with the citing paper's work.

Now, mapping to the predefined classes. CoCoXY is about comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies. Here, the citation is contrasting results between two studies, which fits CoCoXY. The other possible classes could be Neutral, as it's a descriptive mention without directly supporting or comparing to the current work. However, since it's comparing two studies, CoCoXY is primary. The third might be Support if it's used to back up the current findings, but the main intent is comparison. So, the top three are CoCoXY, Neutral, and Support.

1. CoCoXY  
2. Neutral  
3. Support
