Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me start by understanding the context. The passage mentions that the citation refers to a study where the taxonomic status of certain species is problematic. The author is pointing out that some species might not develop on Pyrus, which suggests they're questioning the validity or accuracy of the cited work's findings. 

Looking at the predefined classes, the first thing that comes to mind is "Weakness" because the author is pointing out a limitation or issue in the cited study. They're not supporting or building on it but rather highlighting its flaws. 

Next, "CoCoRes" might also be applicable because the author is comparing their own findings or implications with the cited results, suggesting a contrast. However, the main focus is on the cited work's issues rather than a direct comparison of results. 

"Neutral" is less likely here because the author isn't just mentioning the study without critique; they're actively pointing out its weaknesses. 

So, the top three classes are probably Weakness first, followed by CoCoRes, and then Neutral as the least applicable.

1. Weakness  
2. CoCoRes  
3. Neutral
