Okay, so I need to figure out the top three rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let's start by understanding the context.

The passage mentions that the citation discusses the occurrence of a specific pathogen in a particular region. It's used to support the current study's findings, indicating that previous research has documented the same pathogen in the same area. 

Step 1: Extract the context. The citation is used to reference a previous study that supports the current findings about the pathogen's occurrence.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. This seems to be supportive because the citation is backing up the current research's results with prior evidence.

Step 3: Assign rhetorical classes. The primary class would be Support since it's confirming the findings. Next, Neutral could apply because it's a straightforward reference without any comparison or criticism. Lastly, Similar might fit if the previous study's findings are similar to the current ones, but it's more about support than similarity. Alternatively, Neutral might be the second choice, and Similar the third.

Wait, but the passage explicitly says it supports the current study, so Support is definitely first. Neutral is next because it's a neutral reference without any comparison or criticism. Then, since it's pointing out that previous research also found the same pathogen, Similar could be third because it's highlighting a similarity in findings.

So the top three are Support, Neutral, Similar.

1. Support  
2. Neutral  
3. Similar
