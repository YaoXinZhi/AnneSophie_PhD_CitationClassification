Okay, I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific passage into the top three rhetorical classes. First, I'll extract the context around the citation to understand its role. The passage mentions that the study of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains reported fast multiplication rates and high concentration in young leaves and roots, but conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima. The citation is used here to highlight conflicting findings between two studies. 

Next, I identify the general intent. Since the citation is comparing results from two studies, it's a comparative intent, specifically CoCoRes (Comparison of Results). 

Now, I look at the predefined classes. The primary class is CoCoRes because it's comparing results. CoCoXY is also relevant because it's comparing explanations or claims between the two cited studies. The citation isn't directly supporting or contrasting with the current paper's findings, so Neutral is the third class as it's a descriptive comparison without direct support or criticism.

1. CoCoRes  
2. CoCoXY  
3. Neutral
