Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me go through the steps.

Step 1: Extract the context. The passage mentions that the study by @@CITATION@@ found that the application of magnetic fields prevents the formation of hard calcite scales. It also notes that the explanation of this phenomenon hasn't been offered yet, and the current work aims to understand the mechanism.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation is explaining why the current research is being done, pointing out a knowledge gap. So it's motivational.

Step 3: Rank the specific classes. Motivation is the most appropriate. Since it's pointing out a gap, maybe Future is next, but it's more about the current work's purpose. Neutral could be third if it's just stating facts without comparison or support. So the top three are Motivation, Future, Neutral.

1. Motivation  
2. Future  
3. Neutral
