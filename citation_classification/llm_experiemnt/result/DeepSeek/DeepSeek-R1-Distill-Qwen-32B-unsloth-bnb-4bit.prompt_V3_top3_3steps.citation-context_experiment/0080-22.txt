Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific passage into the top three most appropriate rhetorical classes. 

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the study by @@CITATION@@ reported on the multiplication rates and high concentration of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains in infected daisy plants. It also notes conflicting results for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima. 

Next, I need to identify the general intent of the citation. The passage is comparing the findings of two studies: one where high concentrations were found and another where conflicting results were described. This indicates a comparative intent, specifically comparing the results or findings of the cited works.

Now, looking at the predefined classes, the most appropriate would be CoCoRes since it's about comparing results. Then, since the comparison is between two cited studies rather than with the current paper, CoCoXY is next. Lastly, the citation isn't used to support the current paper's findings but to present a comparison, so Neutral might be a stretch but less likely than the others.

1. CoCoRes  
2. CoCoXY  
3. Neutral
