Okay, I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let's start by extracting the context. The passage mentions that the citation refers to a study where the authors found that the taxonomic status of some species is problematic, suggesting they might not develop on Pyrus. 

Next, I'll identify the general intent. The citation is pointing out a limitation or issue in the cited work, which is critical. 

Now, I'll rank the rhetorical classes. The most appropriate is Weakness because it's directly pointing out a flaw. CoCoRes might be a stretch if comparing results, but it's less direct. Neutral could apply if it's just stating the issue without critique, but Weakness is more precise. So, the top three are Weakness, then CoCoRes, and Neutral as the least.

1. Weakness  
2. CoCoRes  
3. Neutral
