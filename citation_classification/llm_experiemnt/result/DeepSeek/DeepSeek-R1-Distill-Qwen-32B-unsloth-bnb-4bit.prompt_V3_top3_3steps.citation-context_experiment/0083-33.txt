Okay, I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific passage into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. First, I should extract the context around the citation to understand its intent. The context is: "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@@."

So, the authors are discussing their findings about insect hosts affecting bacterial assembly and mention that this finding is supported by other studies. They reference a citation that supports their results, specifically pointing out that similar findings were observed in fleas and ticks. 

Looking at the definitions, the citation is used to support the current work's findings. The example given under the 'Support' class is similar, where a citation supports the authors' results. Therefore, the primary class is 'Support'. 

Next, the citation also points out that the cited work shows a similar pattern, so 'Similar' might also be applicable. However, since the main intent is to support, 'Support' is more accurate. There's no comparison of methods or results with another study, so 'CoCoRes' or 'CoCoXY' doesn't fit. It's not a foundational basis, motivation, future direction, usage, weakness, or neutral. 

So, the top three classes are Support, Similar, and then perhaps Neutral if it's just a mention, but since it's explicitly supporting, Neutral is less likely. But I have to choose three. Since the citation is used to support and show similarity, the third might be Neutral, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if it's just a supporting reference without any comparison, maybe Neutral isn't necessary. However, based on the example, it's better to include 'Support' as 1, 'Similar' as 2, and 'Neutral' as 3 just in case.

1. Support  
2. Similar  
3. Neutral
