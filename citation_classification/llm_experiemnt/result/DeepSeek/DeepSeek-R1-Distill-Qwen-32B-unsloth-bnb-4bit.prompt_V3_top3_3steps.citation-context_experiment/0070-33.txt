Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage says: "The study by @@CITATION@@ demonstrated that increased levels of ozone significantly reduce crop yields, particularly in wheat and rice." So the context is about a study that found ozone levels affecting crop yields.

Next, I have to identify the general intent. The study is cited to show that ozone reduces crop yields, which supports the current paper's findings. So it's being used to back up their results, which makes the general intent supportive.

Now, looking at the predefined classes, Support is the most appropriate because the citation is used to confirm the current work's findings. Then, since it's about supporting results, maybe Similar is next, but actually, it's more about directly supporting than pointing out similarities. Alternatively, Basis could be considered if it's foundational, but it seems more about support. Usage isn't relevant here since it's not about methods. So the top three would be Support, then maybe Similar if they're showing a pattern, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, Neutral if it's just a fact without supporting. But I think Support is the primary.

Wait, the example for Support is when the citation supports the authors' work, which fits here. So 1. Support. Maybe 2. Similar if they're showing a trend, but the passage doesn't compare to another study. So perhaps 2. Neutral, but it's not neutral because it's used to support. Maybe 2. Basis if it's foundational, but it's more about supporting. Hmm, perhaps the top three are Support, Basis, and Neutral. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's just Support and that's it. But I need three, so maybe Support, Similar, and Neutral.

Wait, the passage doesn't compare to another study, so Similar might not apply. So perhaps Support is first, then Neutral if it's just stating a fact, and maybe Basis if it's foundational. But I think Support is the main one. So I'll go with Support, then Basis, then Neutral.

1. Support  
2. Basis  
3. Neutral
