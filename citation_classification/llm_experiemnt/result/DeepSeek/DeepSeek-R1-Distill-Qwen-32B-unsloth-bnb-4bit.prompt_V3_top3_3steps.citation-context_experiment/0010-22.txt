Okay, I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific passage into the top three rhetorical classes. Let me go through the steps.

Step 1: Extract the context. The passage is about a study on plant health, specifically looking at how certain treatments affect plant diseases. The citation is used in a sentence that compares the results of the current study with previous findings. 

Step 2: Identify the general intent. Since the citation is used to compare results, the intent is comparative. That narrows it down to CoCoGM, CoCoRes, or CoCoXY.

Step 3: Determine the specific class. The citation is comparing the results directly, so CoCoRes is the most appropriate. If there are other citations used for comparison, maybe CoCoXY, but in this case, it's just one citation. Neutral is possible if it's just a mention without comparison, but since it's comparing, Neutral is less likely. So the top three are CoCoRes, then CoCoXY, and Neutral as a lower possibility.

1. CoCoRes  
2. CoCoXY  
3. Neutral
