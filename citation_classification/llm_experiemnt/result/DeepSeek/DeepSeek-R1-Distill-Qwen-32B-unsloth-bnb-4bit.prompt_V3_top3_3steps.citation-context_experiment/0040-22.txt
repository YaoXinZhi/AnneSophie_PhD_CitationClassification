Okay, so I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific passage into the top three most appropriate rhetorical classes. Let me start by understanding the process step by step.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the citation discusses the multiplication rates of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains in young developing leaves and roots of infected daisy plants. It also notes conflicting results for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima. The citation is used to highlight these conflicting results.

Next, I'll identify the general intent. The citation is comparing two studies to show conflicting results. This suggests a comparative intent, specifically pointing out differences between the cited works.

Now, looking at the predefined classes, the most appropriate would be CoCoXY because it's comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies. Then, since it's highlighting conflicting results, CoCoRes could be next, as it deals with comparing results. Lastly, it's a descriptive comparison, so Neutral might be the third choice, though it's more about the nature of the comparison rather than a neutral mention.

1. CoCoXY  
2. CoCoRes  
3. Neutral
