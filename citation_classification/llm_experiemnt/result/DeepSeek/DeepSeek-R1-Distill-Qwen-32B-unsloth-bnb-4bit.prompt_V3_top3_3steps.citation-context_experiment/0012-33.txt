Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by understanding the context. The passage mentions that the study's findings are supported by previous research, specifically pointing out that participants didn't distinguish between personal interests and values, nor between competence and methods. The citation is used here to back up these findings.

First, I'll extract the context. The relevant part is that the study's results align with previous research, which is cited. This suggests that the citation is being used to support the current findings.

Next, identifying the general intent. Since the citation is backing up the current results, the intent is supportive. That points towards the Support class.

Looking at the predefined classes, Support is when the citation confirms the authors' work. So that's definitely the top choice.

Are there other possible classes? Maybe Similar, because it's showing that other studies have similar results. But the primary use here is to support, not just to note similarity. So Similar could be second.

What about Neutral? The citation isn't being used neutrally; it's actively supporting the findings. So Neutral isn't appropriate here.

Other classes like Motivation, Future, or Usage don't fit because the citation isn't about why the research is being done or suggesting future work, nor is it about using a method from the cited work.

So the top three would be Support, Similar, and then maybe Neutral, but since Neutral isn't fitting, perhaps another class. Wait, maybe CoCoRes if comparing results, but in this case, it's more about supporting rather than comparing. So I think Support is first, Similar second, and maybe Basis if it's foundational, but it's more about supporting the current work.

So final order: Support, Similar, then perhaps Weakness if it's pointing out a flaw, but that's not the case here. So maybe Neutral is third, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if it's not critical, Neutral might not apply. Maybe the third is Basis if it's foundational, but in this case, it's more about support.

Wait, the example given for Support is similar to this situation, where the citation supports the findings. So yes, Support is first. Similar could be second because it's showing that other studies have similar results. Third might be Neutral, but since it's being used to support, Neutral doesn't fit. So perhaps the third is Basis, but it's not about the foundation but the support. Alternatively, maybe there's no third class, but I need to pick three. So I'll go with Support, Similar, and then maybe Basis, but I'm not certain.

Wait, the passage says "supported by previous research," so it's definitely Support. Then Similar because it's pointing out that other studies have similar findings. The third could be Basis if it's foundational, but it's more about supporting than being foundational. Alternatively, maybe Neutral isn't appropriate here because it's not a neutral mention but a supportive one.

Hmm, perhaps the third class is Neutral, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe CoCoRes if comparing results, but it's more about supporting than comparing. So I think the top three are Support, Similar, and then Neutral, but I'm not entirely confident about Neutral as the third. Maybe it's better to list Support, Similar, and then CoCoRes as third if it's about comparing results, but in this case, it's more about supporting. So perhaps Support, Similar, and then Basis if the cited work is foundational, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the third is CoCoRes because it's comparing the results, but I think it's more about supporting. So I'll stick with Support as first, Similar as second, and Neutral as third, even though it's a stretch.
