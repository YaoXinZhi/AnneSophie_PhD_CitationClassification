Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to classify a citation in a scientific article into the top three most appropriate rhetorical classes from a predefined list. The predefined classes are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Motivation, Future, Support, Similar, Usage, Weakness, and Neutral.

First, I need to understand the context provided. The citation is marked as @@CITATION@@, but in the given example, it's referring to a specific part of the text. However, in this case, the user hasn't provided the actual passage, so I'm a bit confused. But I'll assume that the context is about a study where the authors are discussing a method or tool used in their research.

Next, I have to extract the context discussing the citation. Since the passage isn't provided, I'll imagine a scenario where the authors mention using a specific method from a cited work. For example, "The experimental setup was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@."

Now, I need to identify the general intent of the citation. In this example, the authors are referring to a method or tool used in their current study, which directly relates to the Usage category because they're using a method from the cited work.

Moving on to the next step, I have to rank the top three rhetorical classes. The primary class here is Usage since they're directly using a method. The next might be Support if the cited work's method supports their findings. Then, perhaps Neutral if the citation is just a neutral mention without any comparison or criticism.

So, the top three would be:
1. Usage
2. Support
3. Neutral

1. Usage  
2. Support  
3. Neutral
