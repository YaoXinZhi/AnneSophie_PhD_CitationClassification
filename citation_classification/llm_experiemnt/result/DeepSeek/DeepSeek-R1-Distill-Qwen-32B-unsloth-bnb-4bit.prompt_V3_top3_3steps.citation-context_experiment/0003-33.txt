Okay, I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage into the top three rhetorical classes. Let me go through the steps.

First, extract the context. The passage mentions that the study by @@CITATION@@ found that the application of magnetic fields can prevent the formation of hard calcite scales. It also notes that the mechanism behind this effect is not yet understood, which is why the current work aims to investigate it.

Next, identify the general intent. The citation is used to explain why the current research is being conducted. It points out a knowledge gap—the mechanism isn't understood—so the current study is motivated by this gap. That suggests the general intent is Motivational.

Now, assign the specific rhetorical classes. The primary class here is Motivation because the citation justifies the research's purpose. There's no comparison or support mentioned, so the next possible could be Basis if it's foundational, but it's more about motivation. Since the citation isn't used to compare or support, the other classes like Support or Basis don't fit as well. So, the top three would be Motivation, followed by Neutral if there's a descriptive element, but since the main intent is motivational, I might consider Future if it's suggesting future directions, but it's more about the current motivation. Alternatively, Basis if it's foundational, but the key is motivation.

1. Motivation  
2. Basis  
3. Neutral
