Alright, I need to determine the top three rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by extracting the context around the citation.

The passage says, "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@@."

Looking at this, the authors are discussing their findings about insect hosts affecting bacterial communities. They mention that their results are supported by recent cross-taxon investigations, specifically citing another study. The use of the word "supported" indicates that the citation is backing up their findings with similar results from another study.

So, the general intent here is supportive. The citation is used to confirm or back up the authors' results. Now, mapping this to the predefined classes:

1. **Support**: The citation is clearly used to support the current study's findings, so this is the most appropriate.
2. **Similar**: The cited work shows similar patterns or results, which is a close second.
3. **Neutral**: While the citation isn't neutral, it's possible if the context were different, but in this case, it's more about supporting than being neutral.

I don't see elements of comparison of goals, methods, or results beyond support, so other classes like CoCoRes or CoCoGM aren't applicable here. The citation isn't used to point out weaknesses or motivate future work either. It's purely about supporting the current findings with similar evidence.

1. Support  
2. Similar  
3. Neutral
