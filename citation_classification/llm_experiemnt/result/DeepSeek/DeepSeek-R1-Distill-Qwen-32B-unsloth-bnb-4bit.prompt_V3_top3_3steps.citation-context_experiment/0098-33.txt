Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by understanding the context.

The passage mentions that the citation is used to support the finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly. It references a study that showed similar results in fleas and ticks, where the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages. 

Looking at the definitions, Support is when the citation confirms the work of the current authors. Here, the cited work supports the current findings, so Support is the primary class. 

Next, Similar is when the cited work points out a similarity in results or phenomena. Since the cited study shows similar patterns in different hosts, Similar is the second class. 

Lastly, the citation is used in a descriptive manner without necessarily supporting or comparing, so Neutral could also apply as the third class.

1. Support  
2. Similar  
3. Neutral
