Okay, I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage into the top three rhetorical classes. Let me go through the steps.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the citation describes how certain plant species affect bacterial communities in their hosts. It specifically notes that the cited work found similar patterns where the arthropod host influences bacterial assemblages, not the rodent host or environmental factors. 

Next, I'll identify the general intent. The context is pointing out a similarity between the cited work and the current paper's findings. Both studies observed that the host plays a significant role in bacterial community assembly, which suggests a similarity in results or observations.

Now, I need to rank the rhetorical classes. The most appropriate is 'Similar' because the citation directly supports the current paper's findings by showing a similar pattern. 'Support' is next because the citation is used to back up the current results. 'Neutral' is third since the citation isn't used to compare methods or results but simply to highlight a similarity without criticism or additional motivation.

1. Similar  
2. Support  
3. Neutral
