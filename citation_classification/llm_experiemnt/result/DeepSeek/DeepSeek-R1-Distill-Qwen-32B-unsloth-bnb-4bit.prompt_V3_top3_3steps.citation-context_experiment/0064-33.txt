Okay, so I need to figure out the top three rhetorical classes for the citation marked @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by understanding the context and the definitions.

First, I'll extract the context around @@CITATION@@. The passage mentions that several studies have reported the presence of the pathogen in various hosts, including weeds and ornamental plants. It specifically cites @@CITATION@@ for studies on weeds and ornamental plants. 

Next, I need to identify the general intent. The citation is used to support the current paper's findings by referencing similar observations in other studies. This suggests a supportive intent.

Now, looking at the predefined classes, Support seems to fit because the citation is confirming the current work's results. The example given for Support uses a similar structure, citing previous research that aligns with the current findings.

CoCoXY is another possibility because the citation compares findings across different studies, though in this case, it's more about supporting rather than contrasting. However, since the citation is part of a list that includes other studies, it could be seen as comparing across studies, hence CoCoXY.

Neutral is also a consideration because the citation is presented in a descriptive manner without explicitly supporting or comparing. However, since the context is about supporting the current findings, Neutral might be less appropriate here.

So, the top three would be Support, CoCoXY, and Neutral. Support is the most direct, followed by CoCoXY for the comparative aspect, and Neutral as a fallback.

1. Support  
2. CoCoXY  
3. Neutral
