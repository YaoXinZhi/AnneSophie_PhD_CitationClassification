Okay, I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage into the top three rhetorical classes. First, I'll look at the context to understand how the citation is used. The passage mentions that the study by @@CITATION@@ found high concentrations of two strains in infected plants, but also notes conflicting results from another study. 

Step 1: Extract the context. The citation is discussing conflicting results between studies on phytoplasma concentrations in plants.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation is comparing two studies to highlight conflicting findings, so it's a comparative intent.

Step 3: Assign specific classes. Since it's comparing two cited studies, CoCoXY is most appropriate. Next, it's a comparison of results, so CoCoRes. Lastly, it's not directly supporting or motivating, so Neutral is the third.

1. CoCoXY  
2. CoCoRes  
3. Neutral
