Okay, I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the citation reports on the multiplication rates and high concentration of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains in young developing leaves and roots of infected daisy plants. It also notes conflicting results for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima.

Next, I need to identify the general intent. The context is comparing results from different studies. The first part supports the current findings, while the second part points out conflicting results. This suggests a comparative intent, specifically comparing explanations or claims between two studies.

Looking at the predefined classes, CoCoXY fits because it's about comparing explanations or claims between cited studies. The passage isn't directly comparing with the citing paper's results (which would be CoCoRes) but rather two cited studies. So, CoCoXY is the primary class.

The passage also supports the current findings by referencing Wei et al., so Support is another relevant class. However, since the main point is the comparison between studies, CoCoXY is more appropriate. There's no mention of motivation, future directions, or weaknesses, so those aren't applicable here.

So, the top three classes are CoCoXY, followed by Support, and then Neutral because the citation is used descriptively without necessarily supporting or comparing beyond what's stated.

1. CoCoXY  
2. Support  
3. Neutral
