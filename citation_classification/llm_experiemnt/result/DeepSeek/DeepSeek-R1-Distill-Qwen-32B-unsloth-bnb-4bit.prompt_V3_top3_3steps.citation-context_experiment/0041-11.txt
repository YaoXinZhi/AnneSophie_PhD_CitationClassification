Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific passage. First, I need to extract the context surrounding the citation to understand its intent. The passage mentions that the citation is used to point out a similarity between the cited work and the current paper, specifically regarding the findings on bacterial community assembly influenced by arthropod hosts. 

Next, I'll identify the general intent. Since the citation is highlighting a similarity in results or observations, it falls under the Supportive category. Now, looking at the specific rhetorical classes, Similar is the most appropriate because it directly points out the similarity. Support is next, as it also relates to confirming findings. Neutral is third since there's no comparison or criticism involved, just a descriptive mention of similarity.

1. Similar  
2. Support  
3. Neutral
