Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific passage. Let me start by understanding the context and the task.

First, I need to extract the context discussing the citation. The passage mentions that the citation is about the multiplication rates and concentration of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains in young leaves and roots of infected daisy plants. It also notes conflicting results from another study on a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima.

Next, I should identify the general intent of the citation. The passage is comparing results from two different studies. One study reports high multiplication rates, while another describes conflicting results. This suggests that the citation is used to compare findings between studies, which falls under a comparative intent.

Now, I need to map this to the specific rhetorical classes. The options are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Motivation, Future, Support, Similar, Usage, Weakness, Neutral. Since the citation is comparing two cited studies with each other, not with the current paper, it fits under CoCoXY. 

Looking at the other classes, it's not about goals or methods (CoCoGM) or directly comparing results with the current paper (CoCoRes). It's specifically comparing two other studies, so CoCoXY is the primary class. 

The next most appropriate might be Neutral, as the citation is presented without strong support or criticism, just stating the conflicting results. Then, Support could be a stretch if considering it as supporting the idea of conflicting results, but it's less direct.

So, the top three classes are CoCoXY, Neutral, and Support.

1. CoCoXY  
2. Neutral  
3. Support
