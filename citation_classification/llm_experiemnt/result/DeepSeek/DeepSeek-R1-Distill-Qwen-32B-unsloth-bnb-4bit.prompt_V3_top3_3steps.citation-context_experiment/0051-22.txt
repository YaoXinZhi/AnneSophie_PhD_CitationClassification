Okay, let me try to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the citation discusses the multiplication rates and high concentration of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains in infected daisy plants. It also notes conflicting results for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima. 

The general intent here seems to be a comparison between two studies. The authors are pointing out that while some studies show high concentrations, others have conflicting results. This suggests they're comparing the findings or explanations from different studies.

Looking at the predefined classes, the most fitting ones would involve comparison. CoCoXY is about comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies, which fits here since they're contrasting results. CoCoRes involves comparing results directly, which is also applicable because they're discussing differing outcomes. Neutral could be considered if the citation is just stating facts without comparison, but since they're highlighting the conflict, it's more about comparison.

So, the top three classes would be CoCoXY, CoCoRes, and Neutral. But since the focus is on the comparison, Neutral might be less appropriate. Alternatively, if the citation is just providing background without direct comparison, Neutral could be higher, but given the context, it's more about comparing studies.

Wait, actually, the example given for CoCoXY is when two studies are compared. Here, the authors mention two studies with conflicting results, so CoCoXY is spot on. CoCoRes is also relevant because they're comparing results. Neutral might be less so because the context is about the comparison, not just a neutral mention.

So, the top three would be CoCoXY first, then CoCoRes, and maybe Neutral as third if there's a neutral mention, but since the context is about comparison, Neutral might not be as fitting. Alternatively, if the citation is used to set up a comparison, then CoCoXY is primary, CoCoRes secondary, and maybe another class like Basis if it's foundational, but I think it's more about comparison.

I think the best order is CoCoXY first, then CoCoRes, and Neutral third if there's a neutral aspect, but perhaps it's more about the comparison. Alternatively, if the citation is used to support their point by showing conflicting results, then Support could come into play, but I think the primary intent is comparison.

So, final order: CoCoXY, CoCoRes, and Neutral.

1. CoCoXY  
2. CoCoRes  
3. Neutral
