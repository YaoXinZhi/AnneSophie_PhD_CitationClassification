Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me start by understanding the context. The passage mentions that the citation is about a study where a small aphid gut binding peptide interferes with enamovirus uptake. It also notes that the peptide bound to gut epithelia of other aphid species, suggesting broader applicability.

Now, looking at the intent. The authors are discussing their finding about the peptide affecting multiple aphid species. They're using the citation to back up their observation, showing that their results align with previous findings. So, the citation is supporting their own results by referencing similar outcomes from another study.

Next, I need to assign the top three rhetorical classes. The primary class here is Support because the citation is confirming the authors' findings. It's also a Similar case because it's pointing out that the cited work shows a similar pattern. Usage might be a stretch, but since the authors are using the cited study's results to support their own, it could fit as a third option. Alternatively, Neutral could be considered if the citation is just stating a fact without explicitly supporting, but Support and Similar seem more accurate here.

1. Support  
2. Similar  
3. Usage
