Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me go through the steps as outlined.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage says, "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@@." 

From this, I can see that the citation is supporting the authors' finding by referencing other studies. The key point is that the cited work supports the current study's results.

Next, I identify the general intent. Since the citation is used to confirm or back up the authors' findings, the general intent is supportive.

Now, looking at the predefined classes, the most appropriate would be 'Support' because the citation directly supports the current work's findings. 

Then, 'Similar' might also fit because the cited work is similar in showing that hosts affect bacterial communities. 

Lastly, 'Neutral' could be considered, but since the citation is clearly used to support, it's less likely than the other two. So, the top three are Support, Similar, Neutral.

1. Support  
2. Similar  
3. Neutral
