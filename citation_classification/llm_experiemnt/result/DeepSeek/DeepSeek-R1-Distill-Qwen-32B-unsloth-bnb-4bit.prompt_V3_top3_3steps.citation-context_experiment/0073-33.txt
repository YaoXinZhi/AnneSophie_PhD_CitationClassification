Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, I should extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the citation is about the multiplication rates and conflicting results in different studies. It specifically talks about two studies and a conflicting result from another, which is the citation in question.

Next, I need to identify the general intent. Since the citation is comparing conflicting results between studies, it's a comparative context. That points towards the CoCoRes or CoCoXY classes.

Looking at the definitions, CoCoRes is about comparing results directly with the citing paper, while CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies with each other. Here, the citation is used to contrast two studies, so CoCoXY seems appropriate.

The other possible class is CoCoRes because it's discussing conflicting results, which are findings. However, since it's comparing two cited works rather than the citing paper, CoCoXY is more precise.

Neutral might be a stretch if the citation is just stating a fact without comparison, but since it's part of a comparison, Neutral isn't the best fit.

So, the top three classes are CoCoXY, CoCoRes, and Neutral.

1. CoCoXY  
2. CoCoRes  
3. Neutral
