Okay, I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me go through the steps one by one.

First, I need to extract the context discussing the citation. The passage says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." So, the context is about comparing the current results with those from another study that used different targets.

Next, I identify the general intent. The sentence mentions that the results differ, which suggests a comparison of findings. That points towards a comparative intent. Looking at the predefined classes, comparative intents include CoCoGM, CoCoRes, and CoCoXY.

Now, I need to assign the top three specific rhetorical classes. The citation is directly comparing the results of two studies. The primary class here is CoCoRes because it's about comparing results. 

Is there any other class that might fit? Well, since the comparison is between the cited work and the current paper, it's not CoCoXY, which is used when comparing two cited works. So CoCoRes is the first choice.

As for the second and third classes, the passage doesn't mention any motivation, support, or weaknesses, so those are less likely. It's a straightforward comparison of results, so the other comparative classes might not apply as strongly. 

So, the top three classes would be CoCoRes as the most appropriate, followed by possibly CoCoXY if there were a comparison between cited works, but since it's comparing with the current paper, maybe Neutral or something else. Wait, but the context is about differing results, so maybe there's a nuance. However, since the main action is comparing results, CoCoRes is definitely first. The other classes might not fit as well because the intent is clear in comparing results. 

I think the top three would be CoCoRes as the first, then perhaps Neutral if it's just a factual comparison without any other intent, and maybe CoCoGM if there's a method comparison, but the passage doesn't mention methods. So, I'll stick with CoCoRes as the main class and maybe Neutral and CoCoXY as less likely but still possible.

1. CoCoRes  
2. Neutral  
3. CoCoXY
