Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let's start by looking at the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the citation describes the presence of the pathogen in plant roots and its effect on root development. It also notes that the pathogen's impact is similar to what's been found in other studies.

First, I need to extract the context. The citation is discussing the pathogen's presence and its effect on roots, and it's comparing this to other findings. So the context is about the pathogen's impact and its similarity to other studies.

Next, identifying the general intent. Since the citation is being used to show that the findings are consistent with others, it's supporting the current work. That leans towards a supportive intent.

Now, looking at the specific rhetorical classes. Support is definitely a fit because the citation is backing up the current findings. Similar is also relevant because it's pointing out that the results are in line with other studies. Neutral might apply if it's just stating a fact without any comparison, but since it's being used to support, Neutral is less likely. Other classes like Motivation or Weakness don't fit here.

So the top three classes would be Support, Similar, and Neutral.

1. Support  
2. Similar  
3. Neutral
