Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm given a scientific passage with a citation marked @@CITATION@@, and I need to classify it into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. The classes are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Motivation, Future, Support, Similar, Usage, Weakness, and Neutral. I need to extract the context, determine the general intent, and then assign the top three most appropriate classes.

First, I'll look at the context provided. The passage mentions that the citation is discussing the multiplication rates and concentration of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains in young developing leaves and roots of infected daisy plants. It also notes conflicting results from another study regarding a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima. 

So, the context is about comparing two studies. One study reports high multiplication rates and concentration in daisy plants, while the other describes conflicting results in a different plant. The citation is used to highlight these conflicting findings between the two studies.

Now, identifying the general intent. This seems like a comparison between two cited works, not directly with the citing paper. The focus is on contrasting the results of the two studies. Therefore, the intent is Comparative.

Looking at the predefined classes, the Comparative category includes CoCoGM, CoCoRes, and CoCoXY. Since the passage is comparing the results of two studies, CoCoRes (Comparison of Results) seems most appropriate. CoCoXY (Comparison of Explanations or Claims) might also fit because it's about conflicting results, which are a form of explanation or claim. Neutral could be a stretch if the comparison is presented without any particular stance, but it's less likely than the more specific Comparative classes.

So, the top three classes would be CoCoRes as the primary, CoCoXY as secondary, and Neutral as a possible third if the comparison is neutral.

1. CoCoRes  
2. CoCoXY  
3. Neutral
