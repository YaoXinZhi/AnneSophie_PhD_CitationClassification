Okay, I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific passage into the top three rhetorical classes. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the citation is used to support the findings of the current study. It states that the subscales were consistent with previous research, specifically referencing @@CITATION@@, and that participants didn't distinguish between certain reasons for disputes, similar to what was found before.

Next, I'll identify the general intent. Since the citation is supporting the current findings by referencing previous research, it falls under the supportive category. This means the citation is used to confirm or back up the results presented in the paper.

Now, looking at the specific rhetorical classes, the most appropriate one here is Support because the citation directly supports the current work's results. The second could be Similar since it's pointing out that the results are consistent with previous studies, indicating a similarity. Lastly, Neutral might also apply because the citation is used in a descriptive manner without necessarily comparing or contrasting with other works, just stating the consistency.

So, the top three classes are Support, Similar, and Neutral.
