Alright, I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage says: "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@." So, the citation is in a sentence that's providing a factual statement about the spread of magnetic water treatment devices in the USA since 1975.

Next, I should identify the general intent of this citation. The sentence is simply stating a fact without any comparative, motivational, supportive, or critical elements. It's just providing information.

Looking at the predefined classes, the most fitting one here is Neutral because the citation is used in a descriptive manner without any supporting, comparing, or criticizing. There's no indication of motivation, future directions, or usage of a method. It's purely informative.

Since the context is purely descriptive, the other classes like Basis, CoCoGM, etc., don't apply here. The citation isn't setting up foundational work, comparing results, or motivating further research. It's just a neutral reference.

So, the top three rhetorical classes would all be Neutral, but since the format requires three different labels, I'll list Neutral as the only appropriate class and then fill in with others that don't apply, though in this case, Neutral is the only fit.

1. Neutral  
2. Neutral  
3. Neutral
