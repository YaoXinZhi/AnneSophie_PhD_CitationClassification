Okay, so I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. Let me go through the process step by step.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the citation discusses the multiplication rates of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains in young leaves and roots of infected daisy plants. It also notes conflicting results for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima. 

Now, looking at the general intent, it seems the citation is being used to compare results between two studies. The authors are pointing out that while some studies report high multiplication rates, others have conflicting findings. This comparison is about the results or explanations provided in the cited works.

Next, I need to assign the top three rhetorical classes. The most appropriate is CoCoRes because the passage directly compares the results of different studies. Then, CoCoXY might be relevant since it's about comparing explanations or claims between the cited studies. Lastly, Neutral could be considered because the citation is presented in a factual manner without explicitly supporting or criticizing, but it's less likely than the other two.

1. CoCoRes  
2. CoCoXY  
3. Neutral
