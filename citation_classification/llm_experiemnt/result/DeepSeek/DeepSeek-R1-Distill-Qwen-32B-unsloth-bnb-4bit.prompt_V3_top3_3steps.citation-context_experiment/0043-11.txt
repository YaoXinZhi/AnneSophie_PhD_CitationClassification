Okay, so I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific passage into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. Let me go through the steps as outlined.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the study found conflicting results about the multiplication rates of two strains in different plant parts. It references two studies: Wei et al. (2004) and Saracco et al. (2006). The citation @@CITATION@@ is used in the context of these conflicting findings.

Next, I need to determine the general intent. The citation is comparing two studies that have conflicting results. So, it's a comparative context, which points towards one of the CoCo classes.

Looking at the definitions, CoCoXY is used when comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies. Here, the passage is pointing out conflicting results between Wei et al. and Saracco et al., which fits CoCoXY.

The other possible classes could be CoCoRes if it were comparing results directly, but since it's about conflicting explanations or findings, CoCoXY is more accurate. Neutral might also be considered if it were just stating facts without comparison, but the comparison is explicit.

So, the top three classes would be CoCoXY as the most appropriate, followed by CoCoRes if there's a nuance in results, and then Neutral as a fallback if comparison isn't the focus.

1. CoCoXY  
2. CoCoRes  
3. Neutral
