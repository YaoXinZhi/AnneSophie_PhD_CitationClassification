Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm given a scientific passage where a citation is marked as @@CITATION@@, and I need to classify this citation into the top three most appropriate rhetorical classes. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. Let's assume the passage is something like: "Previous studies have shown that plant pathogens can significantly affect crop yields. @@CITATION@@ highlights the importance of early detection in managing these pathogens effectively."

Step 1: Extract the context. The sentence mentions that previous studies have shown the impact of plant pathogens on crop yields, and the citation highlights the importance of early detection. So the context is about the role of early detection in managing plant pathogens, referencing a specific study.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation is used to support the argument that early detection is crucial. It's providing evidence or backing for the statement about the importance of early detection. So the general intent is supportive.

Step 3: Assign specific rhetorical classes. From the predefined list, the most appropriate would be Support because the citation is backing up the claim. Next, it could be Motivation if it's justifying why early detection is important. However, since it's more about confirming the importance rather than justifying the research, Support is primary. The third could be Neutral if the citation is just providing information without any particular stance, but since it's highlighting importance, it's more supportive. Alternatively, if the citation is used to compare with other studies, it might be CoCoRes or Similar, but in this case, it's more about supporting the statement.

So, the top three would be:

1. Support
2. Motivation
3. Neutral

1. Support  
2. Motivation  
3. Neutral
