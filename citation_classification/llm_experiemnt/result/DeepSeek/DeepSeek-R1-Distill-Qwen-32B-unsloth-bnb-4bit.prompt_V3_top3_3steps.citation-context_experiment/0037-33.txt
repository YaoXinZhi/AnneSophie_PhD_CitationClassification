Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm given a scientific passage and I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. The passage is about the effect of magnetic fields on water treatment. The authors mention that their previous research showed magnetic fields prevent scale formation but the mechanism isn't understood, so they're conducting this new study.

First, I need to extract the context around @@CITATION@@. The sentence says, "Our previous research @@CITATION@@ has shown that the formation of the hard calcite scale on the surfaces exposed to hard water can be successfully prevented with the applied magnetic field." So, the citation is referencing their own past work that established the effectiveness of magnetic fields in preventing scale. 

Next, I identify the general intent. The authors are using this citation to justify their current research, pointing out a knowledge gap about the mechanism. This fits under the Motivational category because they're explaining why their new study is necessary.

Now, I need to rank the specific rhetorical classes. The primary class here is Motivation because the citation is used to set the stage for their current research by highlighting an unresolved issue. Since the citation doesn't compare methods or results with other studies, CoCoGM or CoCoRes aren't the main focus. It's not about supporting or using a method, so Support or Usage are less relevant. Neutral is possible but less specific than Motivation. So, the top three are Motivation, followed by Neutral, and then Support as a distant third.

1. Motivation  
2. Neutral  
3. Support
