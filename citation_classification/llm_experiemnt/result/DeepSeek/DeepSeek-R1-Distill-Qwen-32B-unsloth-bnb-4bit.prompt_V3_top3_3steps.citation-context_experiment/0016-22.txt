Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm given a scientific passage with a citation marked @@CITATION@@, and I need to classify it into the top three rhetorical classes from the predefined list. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage discusses how the formation of hard calcite scale on surfaces exposed to hard water can be prevented using a magnetic field, referencing a previous study. The current work aims to understand the mechanism behind this phenomenon.

Next, I'll identify the general intent of the citation. The citation is used to justify why the current research is being conducted, pointing out that the mechanism isn't yet understood. This falls under the Motivation category.

Now, I'll rank the top three specific rhetorical classes. The primary class is Motivation because it explains the reason for the current study. The citation also supports the previous finding, so Support is the second. Since the study is about understanding a mechanism, it could be seen as a foundation for future research, making Future the third.
