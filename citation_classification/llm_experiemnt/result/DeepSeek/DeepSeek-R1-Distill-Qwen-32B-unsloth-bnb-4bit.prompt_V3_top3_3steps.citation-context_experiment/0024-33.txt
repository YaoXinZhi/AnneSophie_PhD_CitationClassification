Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. First, I'll read through the context provided to understand how the citation is used. The context mentions that the citation is used in a passage about the replication of inoffensive results for the same purposes as introduced by the cited work. 

Hmm, so the citation is referring to foundational research that established the IAT and its validation. The current study is replicating these results, which suggests that the cited work is serving as the intellectual basis for their research. This points towards the 'Basis' class because it's setting the foundation.

Next, looking at the example given, it's clear that the citation is being used to establish the groundwork for their study. They're not comparing their methods or results with others, nor are they using it to motivate their research or to support their findings. It's purely about building upon the existing work.

So, the primary class is definitely 'Basis'. There's no indication of comparison, motivation, support, or any other classes. Therefore, the top three would just be 'Basis' as the only applicable class, but since we need three, I'll list it first and then include 'Neutral' and 'Support' as less likely but possible alternatives, even though they don't fit as well.

1. Basis  
2. Neutral  
3. Support
