Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by extracting the context. The passage says, "The study by @@CITATION@@ demonstrated that the application of magnetic fields can significantly reduce the formation of hard water scale in industrial pipelines. This finding has been widely replicated and forms the basis for our current investigation into the long-term durability of magnetic water treatment systems." 

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The context mentions that the cited study demonstrated the effectiveness of magnetic fields in reducing scale formation, and that this finding has been replicated. It also states that this forms the basis for their current work. 

Now, identifying the general intent. The citation is used to establish the foundation for their current research. They mention that it's the basis for their investigation, which suggests it's foundational. So the general intent is Foundational, which maps to the Basis class.

Next, I need to rank the top three specific rhetorical classes. The primary class is definitely Basis because it's the foundation. Are there other classes that might apply? The passage also mentions that the finding has been widely replicated, which could indicate Support, as it's confirming previous work. However, the main focus is on using it as a basis, not just supporting. There's no comparison involved, so CoCo classes aren't relevant here. No motivation, future, or usage is mentioned. It's not critical or neutral either. So the next possible class after Basis is Support, but it's less prominent. 

Wait, maybe Support isn't the best fit. The passage uses the citation to show that their current work builds on it, which is more about the foundation than supporting their results. So perhaps the second class could be Neutral if it's just stating a fact without much argument, but I think Basis is more accurate. 

Alternatively, since the citation is used to justify their current research by pointing out a knowledge gap (the need to investigate long-term durability), that could relate to Motivation. But the primary intent is still Basis. 

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The citation is foundational, so Basis is first. The passage also uses it to support their current investigation by referencing replicated findings, so Support could be second. The third might be Neutral, as it's just stating the fact of replication without deeper analysis. 

Wait, but the passage doesn't directly support their results; it's more about establishing the foundation. So maybe Support isn't the best fit. Perhaps the second is Neutral, and the third is Motivation because it's implying a need for further investigation. 

No, I think the key is that the citation is the basis, so Basis is first. Then, since they mention it's been replicated, that's Support. The third might be Neutral because it's a descriptive use of the citation without comparison or criticism. 

Wait, but the example given for Support is when the citation supports the authors' work. Here, the citation is supporting their current investigation, so Support fits. Neutral would be if it's just a mention without supporting anything. 

I'm still a bit unsure, but I think the top three are Basis, Support, and Neutral. 

So, the final order would be:
1. Basis
2. Support
3. Neutral

1. Basis  
2. Support  
3. Neutral
