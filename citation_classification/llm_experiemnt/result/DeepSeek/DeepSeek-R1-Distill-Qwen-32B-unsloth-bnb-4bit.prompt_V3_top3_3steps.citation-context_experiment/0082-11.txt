Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the study by @@CITATION@@ found a specific pattern in the data. This suggests that the authors are referencing another study to support their own findings or to compare results.

Next, I need to determine the general intent. Since the citation is pointing out a specific finding that aligns with their own results, it seems like the authors are using it to support their work. This would fall under the Support category. 

But wait, could it also be Similar? Because they're pointing out a pattern found in another study, which is similar to theirs. So, Similar is another possible category. 

Is there any indication that they're comparing methods or goals? Not really. The context doesn't mention anything about how their methods differ or how their goals are aligned. So CoCoGM or CoCoRes might not fit here.

They're not suggesting future research or pointing out weaknesses in the cited work either, so Future and Weakness are out. Usage doesn't apply because they're not using a method or tool from the cited work.

So, the top three categories would likely be Support, Similar, and Neutral. Neutral because if they're just stating a fact without necessarily supporting or comparing, but given the context, Support and Similar seem more appropriate.

1. Support  
2. Similar  
3. Neutral
