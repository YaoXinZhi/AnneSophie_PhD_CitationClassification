Okay, I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let's start by extracting the context. The passage mentions that the citation discusses the multiplication rates and conflicting results about phytoplasma in different plants. 

The general intent here seems to be comparing two studies. The authors are pointing out conflicting results between their work and another cited study. They're not just supporting or motivating their own research; they're directly contrasting findings.

Looking at the predefined classes, CoCoRes fits because it's about comparing results. CoCoXY is also relevant since they're comparing two cited studies. Neutral might apply if it's just a mention without comparison, but since they're highlighting the conflict, CoCoRes and CoCoXY are more appropriate. 

So, the top three classes are CoCoRes, CoCoXY, and Neutral, though Neutral is less likely since the context is about comparison.

1. CoCoRes  
2. CoCoXY  
3. Neutral
