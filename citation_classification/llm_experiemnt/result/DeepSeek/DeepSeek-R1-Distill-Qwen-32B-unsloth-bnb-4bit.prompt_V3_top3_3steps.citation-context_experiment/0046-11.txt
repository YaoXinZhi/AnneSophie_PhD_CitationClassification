Okay, so I need to figure out the top three rhetorical classes for the citation marked @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me go through the steps as instructed.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage says that the citation discusses how a peptide interferes with virus uptake in aphids and binds to other aphid species, suggesting broader applicability. The authors are pointing out that the peptide's effect isn't just limited to one species but could work more widely.

Next, I need to identify the general intent. The citation is showing that the peptide's applicability is broader, which supports the idea that it might work in other contexts. This seems to be a supportive statement, as it's backing up the effectiveness of the peptide beyond the initial study.

Now, looking at the specific rhetorical classes. The example given for 'Support' is when the citation confirms or supports the current work's findings. Here, the citation supports the idea of broader applicability, so 'Support' is the most appropriate.

For the second class, 'Motivation' might be considered because the citation suggests that there's potential for future research or application. The authors are hinting that this could lead to more studies or uses, so 'Motivation' fits here.

The third class could be 'Future' because the citation implies directions for future research, like testing the peptide on more aphid species or other applications. However, since the primary intent is support, 'Future' is a bit secondary but still relevant.

I think that's the order: Support, Motivation, Future.

1. Support  
2. Motivation  
3. Future
