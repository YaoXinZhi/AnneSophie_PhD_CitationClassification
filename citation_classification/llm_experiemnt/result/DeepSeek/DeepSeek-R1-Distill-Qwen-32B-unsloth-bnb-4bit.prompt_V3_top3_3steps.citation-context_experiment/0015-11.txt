Okay, so I need to figure out the top three rhetorical classes for the citation marked @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by understanding the context and the task.

First, I'll look at the passage to extract the context around the citation. The passage says: "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@@."

From this, I can see that the citation is supporting the authors' finding. They mention that their finding is supported by recent investigations, which are cited. So the citation is used to back up their results.

Next, I need to identify the general intent. The citation is supporting their own work, so the general intent is supportive. Now, looking at the specific classes, the most appropriate is 'Support' because it directly confirms their findings. 

Are there any other classes that might apply? The citation is also pointing out a similarity in results from other studies, so 'Similar' could be another class. Additionally, since the authors are building on existing work, 'Basis' might be relevant as it's part of the foundation of their research.

So, the top three classes are Support, Similar, and Basis.

1. Support  
2. Similar  
3. Basis
