Okay, so I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage into the top three rhetorical classes. Let's start by understanding the context. The passage mentions that the authors found 18 new species of pear psyllids in China and describe their distribution and host plants. They reference a study by Zhang et al. (2020) which described these species. 

Looking at the context, the citation is used to provide support for their findings. They're saying that their work builds on the previous description by Zhang et al. So, the general intent here is to support their current research by referencing a foundational study. 

Now, considering the predefined classes: 

1. **Basis**: This is when the citation is the foundation of the current research. Since Zhang et al. provided the initial description, this fits as a foundational reference.

2. **Support**: The citation supports the current work by confirming the existence and initial descriptions of the species.

3. **Neutral**: The citation is mentioned in a descriptive manner without any comparison or criticism, so it could also be seen as neutral.

So, the top three classes would be Basis, Support, and Neutral.

1. Basis  
2. Support  
3. Neutral
