Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me go through the steps as instructed.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the citation reports on the multiplication rates of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains in young developing leaves and roots of infected daisy plants. It also notes conflicting results for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima.

Next, I should identify the general intent of the citation. It seems like the citation is being used to compare two studies. The first part talks about high multiplication rates in daisy plants, and the second part mentions conflicting results for another phytoplasma in a different plant. This looks like a comparison between two cited studies, not directly comparing with the current paper's work. So, it's a comparative context.

Now, looking at the predefined classes, the most appropriate would be CoCoXY because it's about comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies. The passage doesn't directly compare with the current work, so it's not CoCoGM or CoCoRes. It's specifically contrasting two different findings from other studies.

For the second class, since the citation is pointing out conflicting results, it might also serve as a Motivation for why the current research is being conducted. The authors might be highlighting a knowledge gap or inconsistency that their study addresses.

The third class could be Neutral because the citation is providing factual information about previous findings without necessarily supporting or opposing the current work beyond the comparison.

So, the top three classes would be CoCoXY, Motivation, and Neutral.

1. CoCoXY  
2. Motivation  
3. Neutral
