Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation marked @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific passage. Let me go through the steps as outlined.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the citation discusses the multiplication rates and conflicting results of a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima. It says that conflicting results were described, referencing the citation.

Next, I need to identify the general intent. The citation is pointing out conflicting results between two studies. It's comparing the findings of the cited work with another study, highlighting that there's a discrepancy. This seems like a comparison of explanations or claims between two cited studies.

Looking at the predefined classes, CoCoXY fits here because it's used when comparing explanations or claims between two cited works, not necessarily with the citing paper. The passage isn't comparing its own results or methods, just noting that conflicting results exist between two other studies.

Is there a possibility of another class? Well, it's not a comparison of goals or methods (CoCoGM), nor is it comparing results directly with the current paper (CoCoRes). It's more about the conflict between two cited studies, so CoCoXY is the primary class.

Are there any other relevant classes? The passage isn't supporting, motivating, or using the citation for a method. It's purely about contrasting two studies. So the next possible might be Neutral, but since it's specifically about conflicting results, CoCoXY is more precise. 

So, the top three would be CoCoXY as the most appropriate, followed by Neutral if there's any neutral descriptive element, but since the main intent is comparison, CoCoXY is first. There's no other strong contender, so maybe Neutral and then another class, but I think only CoCoXY is relevant here.

1. CoCoXY  
2. Neutral  
3. Basis
