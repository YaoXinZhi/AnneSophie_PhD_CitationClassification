Okay, so I need to figure out the top three rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me go through the steps as outlined.

First, I'll extract the context. The passage says: "In the study by @@CITATION@@, it was found that the application of magnetic fields could reduce the formation of hard water scales in industrial settings." So, the citation is talking about a study that found magnetic fields reduce scale formation.

Next, I need to identify the general intent. The citation is presenting a finding that supports the use of magnetic fields in reducing scale. It seems to be supporting the current research's approach or results, so the general intent is likely Supportive.

Now, looking at the specific rhetorical classes. The citation is supporting the idea that magnetic fields can reduce scale, so Support is the primary class. It's not comparing methods or results with another study, so CoCoGM or CoCoRes aren't the main points here. It's not pointing out a similarity or a weakness in the cited work either. It's directly supporting the current work's findings.

Are there any other possible classes? Maybe Neutral if it's just stating a fact without supporting or comparing. But since it's being used to support the current study, Support is more accurate. Usage could be if the method was used, but the passage just states the finding, not the method's application. So, Support is the top.

The second class might be Neutral because it's also just stating a fact, but since it's used to support, Support is higher. The third could be Basis if it's foundational, but the context doesn't suggest it's a foundational study. So, perhaps Neutral as the second and Basis as the third, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe there's another class that fits.

Wait, the passage is supporting the current study's approach by citing a previous finding, so Support is the main one. Neutral might be secondary if it's just stating the fact without strong support. But since it's used to support, Support is more appropriate. Maybe the third could be Basis if it's foundational, but it's not clear. Alternatively, it could be Motivation if it's citing to motivate the current study, but in this case, it's supporting the current approach.

Hmm, perhaps the top three are Support, Neutral, and Basis. Or maybe Support, Usage, and Neutral. Wait, Usage is about using a method, tool, etc., which isn't the case here. So, the top three would be Support as the primary, Neutral as the secondary, and maybe Basis as the third if it's considered foundational. Alternatively, if it's just a neutral statement, but it's used to support, so Support is first.

I think the top three are:

1. Support
2. Neutral
3. Basis

1. Support  
2. Neutral  
3. Basis
