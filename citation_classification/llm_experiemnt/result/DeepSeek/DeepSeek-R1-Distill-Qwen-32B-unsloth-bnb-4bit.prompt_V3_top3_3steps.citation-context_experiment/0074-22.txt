Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me go through the steps one by one.

First, I'll extract the context around @@CITATION@@. The passage says, "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@@." 

So, the context is about supporting a finding with another study. The authors are saying their result is supported by recent investigations, specifically citing another study that found similar results in fleas and ticks.

Next, I need to identify the general intent. Since the citation is used to back up their own finding, it's likely supportive. Looking at the predefined classes, Support seems to fit here. The authors are using the cited work to confirm their results.

Now, for the specific classes. The primary class is Support because they're directly using the citation to back up their findings. The second class might be Similar since the cited work shows a similar pattern in a different context (fleas and ticks vs. their study). The third could be Neutral because the citation is presented in a straightforward manner without any comparison or criticism.

Wait, but the example given for Similar mentions supporting a finding, which aligns with Support. However, the passage also points out that the cited study found similar results, which could be considered Similar. So maybe Support is the main one, followed by Similar, and then Neutral.

Alternatively, the citation could also be seen as a Usage if they're referring to a method, but in this case, they're not using the method but the result. So Usage doesn't apply. It's more about the finding, so Support and Similar are more appropriate.

So the top three classes are Support, Similar, and Neutral.

1. Support  
2. Similar  
3. Neutral
