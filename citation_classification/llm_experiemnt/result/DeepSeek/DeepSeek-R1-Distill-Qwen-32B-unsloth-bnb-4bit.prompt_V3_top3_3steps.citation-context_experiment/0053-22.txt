Okay, I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage into the top three rhetorical classes. First, I'll extract the context around the citation to understand its intent. The passage mentions that the citation describes a study showing high infection rates of a virus in a specific plant species. This suggests the citation is being used to support the current research's findings by referencing similar results. 

Next, I identify the general intent. Since the citation is used to back up the current study's results, it's likely supportive. Now, I'll map this to the predefined classes. The most appropriate is Support because it directly confirms the findings. Similar is next as it highlights a resemblance in results. Neutral is third since the citation is used descriptively without comparison or criticism. So, the top three classes are Support, Similar, and Neutral.

1. Support  
2. Similar  
3. Neutral
