Alright, I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the citation is used to discuss the multiplication rates and conflicting results regarding phytoplasma in different plant species. It specifically compares studies by Wei et al., 2004 and Saracco et al., 2006, and then contrasts them with the current work.

Next, I identify the general intent. The citation is comparing two studies to highlight conflicting results, which suggests a comparative intent. This points towards one of the CoCo classes.

Looking at the definitions, CoCoXY is about comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies. Since the passage is contrasting results from Wei et al. and Saracco et al., it fits CoCoXY as the primary class.

CoCoRes is about comparing results with the citing paper, but here the comparison is between two other studies, not the current work. So CoCoRes is less direct but still somewhat related because it's about results comparison.

Neutral could also be considered because the citation is presenting the studies without explicitly supporting or opposing them, but it's more about comparison than neutrality.

So, the top three classes would be CoCoXY, CoCoRes, and Neutral.

1. CoCoXY  
2. CoCoRes  
3. Neutral
