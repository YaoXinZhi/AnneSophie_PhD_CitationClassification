Alright, let's tackle this classification task step by step. I'm given a scientific passage and need to determine the top three rhetorical classes for a specific citation marked as @@CITATION@@. 

First, I need to extract the context surrounding the citation. The passage provided is about a study on the impact of environmental factors on plant health, specifically mentioning a study by Smith et al. (2020) that found a correlation between temperature fluctuations and increased pest infestations in wheat crops.

Next, I'll identify the general intent of the citation. The authors are using the cited work to support their own findings, indicating a supportive intent. This suggests that the citation is used to back up their results or claims.

Now, I need to map this intent to the predefined rhetorical classes. The most appropriate class here is 'Support' because the citation is directly confirming or backing up the current study's findings. 

Looking for the next most relevant class, 'Similar' might also fit because the cited work's findings are similar to the current study's results, showing a pattern or consistency in the data. 

The third class could be 'Neutral' if the citation is simply stating a fact without necessarily supporting or comparing, but in this context, 'Support' and 'Similar' seem more fitting. However, since 'Neutral' is a possible fallback, I'll include it as the third option.

So, the top three classes are Support, Similar, and Neutral.

1. Support  
2. Similar  
3. Neutral
