Alright, I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific passage into the top three rhetorical classes. Let's go through the steps.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the citation reports on the multiplication rates and conflicting results regarding phytoplasma in different plant species. It's comparing findings from two studies.

Next, I'll determine the general intent. The citation is used to compare results between two studies, indicating a comparative intent. This suggests it's related to a CoCo class.

Looking at the specific classes, CoCoRes involves comparing results directly, which fits since the passage contrasts results between studies. CoCoXY is about comparing explanations or claims, which also applies here as they're discussing conflicting findings. Neutral is less likely because the citation isn't just descriptiveâ€”it's highlighting a contrast.

So, the top three classes are CoCoRes, CoCoXY, and Neutral.

1. CoCoRes  
2. CoCoXY  
3. Neutral
