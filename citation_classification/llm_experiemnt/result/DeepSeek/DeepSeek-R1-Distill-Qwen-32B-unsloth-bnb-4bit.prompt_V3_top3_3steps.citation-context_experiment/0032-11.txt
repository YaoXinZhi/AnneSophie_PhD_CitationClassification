Okay, so I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific passage into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. Let me go through the process step by step.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation to understand its usage. The passage says, "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@@." 

So, the context is about supporting a finding. The authors are saying that their results are backed up by other studies. They mention that in fleas and ticks, the arthropod host affects bacterial communities, similar to their own findings.

Next, I'll identify the general intent. Since the citation is used to back up their own results, it's supportive. So, the general intent is Supportive.

Now, looking at the specific rhetorical classes, the most appropriate is Support because the citation directly supports their findings. Another possible class is Similar, as the cited work shows a similar pattern in different insects. Neutral could be considered, but since the citation is used to support their work, Neutral is less likely.

So, the top three classes are Support, Similar, and Neutral.

1. Support  
2. Similar  
3. Neutral
