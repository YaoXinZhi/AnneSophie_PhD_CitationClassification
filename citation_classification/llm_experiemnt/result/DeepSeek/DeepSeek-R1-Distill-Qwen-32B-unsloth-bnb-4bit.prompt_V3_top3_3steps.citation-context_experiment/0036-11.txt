Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by understanding the context. The passage is about a study where they observed that a specific strain of phytoplasma, 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris,' has high multiplication rates and concentrations in young leaves and roots of infected daisy plants. They reference Wei et al., 2004, and Saracco et al., 2006, for these reports. However, they also mention conflicting results from another study on a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima, citing @@CITATION@@.

So, the context is discussing conflicting findings between studies. The authors are pointing out that while some studies show high concentrations in certain plants, another study shows conflicting results in a different plant. 

Now, looking at the general intent, this seems to be a comparison of results or findings. The authors are contrasting the results from different studies. So the general intent is Comparative, specifically looking at the results.

Next, I need to map this to the specific rhetorical classes. The options are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, etc. Since the citation is used to compare two studies' results, the primary class would be CoCoRes (Comparison of Results). 

But wait, the passage is comparing two cited studies with each other, not directly with the citing paper. So maybe CoCoXY (Comparison of Explanations or Claims) is also applicable because it's comparing two studies' findings. 

The third class could be Neutral because the citation is presented without explicitly supporting or criticizing, just stating the conflicting results.

So, the top three would be CoCoRes, CoCoXY, and Neutral.

1. CoCoRes  
2. CoCoXY  
3. Neutral
