Alright, I need to determine the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. First, I'll extract the context. The passage mentions that the citation describes how the application of magnetic fields prevents hard calcite scale formation. It also states that the mechanism behind this is still unexplained, which is the focus of the current study.

Next, I'll identify the general intent. The citation is used to highlight a knowledge gap that the current research aims to address. This indicates a Motivational intent because it explains why the current study is necessary.

Now, I'll rank the specific rhetorical classes. The primary class is Motivation since it directly addresses the reason for the study. The citation also supports the idea that magnetic fields prevent scaling, so Support is the second. Lastly, the citation is used neutrally to present a fact, making Neutral the third.

1. Motivation  
2. Support  
3. Neutral
