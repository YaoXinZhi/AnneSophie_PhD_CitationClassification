Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by understanding the context. The passage is about plant health, specifically discussing the multiplication rates and concentration of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains in daisy plants. It mentions that conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima, citing the reference @@CITATION@@.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The sentence is comparing findings from different studies. It says that while some studies reported high rates in daisy plants, others found conflicting results in a different plant. So the citation is being used to show a contrast between two studies.

Looking at the general intent, this seems to be a comparison. The paper is pointing out that different studies have varying results, which suggests a comparative intent. Now, mapping this to the predefined classes, the options are CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, or Neutral.

CoCoXY is used when comparing two cited studies with each other, not with the citing paper. In this case, the passage is comparing the cited work with another study, which fits CoCoXY. It's not a comparison of goals or methods (CoCoGM), nor is it comparing results directly with the citing paper's results (CoCoRes). It's more about contrasting two different studies.

Neutral is when the citation is used descriptively without any comparison or support. But here, the citation is clearly used to highlight a conflict between studies, so Neutral doesn't fit as the primary class.

So the top class is CoCoXY. Next, I think about other possible classes. Since the passage is pointing out conflicting results, it might also be seen as a weakness in the cited work, but that's not the primary intent. The main intent is to compare the two studies, so CoCoXY is first. 

If I consider other classes, maybe Support or Similar, but the passage isn't supporting or highlighting similarity; it's showing a contrast. So the next possible could be Weakness if the cited work's results are conflicting, but that's a stretch. Alternatively, Neutral could be second if it's just a descriptive mention, but I think the primary is CoCoXY.

Wait, the passage is saying that conflicting results were described, so it's comparing two studies. Therefore, CoCoXY is the main class. Then, perhaps Neutral is second if it's just stating the fact without strong comparison. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe Support if it's supporting the idea of conflicting results, but that's not exactly the case here.

I think the top three would be CoCoXY, followed by Neutral, and then maybe Weakness if the conflict implies a problem with the cited work. But I'm not entirely certain about the third one. Alternatively, it might just be CoCoXY and Neutral, but I need three. Maybe the third is Weakness because the conflicting results might imply issues with the cited study's findings.

1. CoCoXY  
2. Neutral  
3. Weakness
