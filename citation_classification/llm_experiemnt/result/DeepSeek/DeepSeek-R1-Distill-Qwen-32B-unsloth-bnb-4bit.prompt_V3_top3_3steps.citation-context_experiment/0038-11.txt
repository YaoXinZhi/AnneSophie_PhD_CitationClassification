Alright, I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific passage. Let me go through the steps.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the citation supports the current work by providing consistent findings. It's about how participants didn't distinguish between certain reasons for disputes, which matches previous research.

Next, I'll identify the general intent. Since the citation is used to back up the current findings, the intent is supportive.

Now, looking at the specific rhetorical classes, the most appropriate is Support because it directly confirms the results. Then, Similar could be considered since it shows the cited work is aligned with the current study. Neutral might also apply if the citation is just mentioned without any comparison or criticism, but since it's used to support, Support is the top choice, followed by Similar, and then Neutral as a third option.

1. Support  
2. Similar  
3. Neutral
