Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let's start by understanding the context. The passage mentions that the authors found that the application of magnetic fields significantly reduced the growth of harmful bacteria on plant roots. They then reference a study by Smith et al. (2020) which showed similar results in controlling bacterial growth in agricultural settings.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The sentence is about how the current study's results are similar to those found in Smith et al.'s work. The key point here is the comparison of resultsâ€”both studies found that magnetic fields reduce bacterial growth.

Next, I'll identify the general intent. Since the citation is pointing out that another study has similar findings, the intent is supportive or showing similarity. This leans towards the 'Similar' class because it's highlighting that the current findings align with previous research.

Now, looking at the predefined classes, 'Similar' is definitely the top choice. It directly refers to the alignment of results. The second consideration might be 'Support' because the citation is backing up the current study's findings with another study. However, 'Support' is more about confirming the work, whereas 'Similar' is about pointing out that the results are alike.

Is there a possibility of another class? Maybe 'CoCoRes' for comparison of results, but in this case, it's more about showing similarity rather than contrasting or comparing directly. So 'Similar' is more accurate. 'Neutral' could be considered if the citation was just stating a fact without any implication, but here it's clearly used to show alignment, so 'Neutral' isn't the best fit.

Therefore, the top three classes would be 'Similar' as the most appropriate, followed by 'Support' and then 'Neutral' as the least relevant.

1. Similar  
2. Support  
3. Neutral
