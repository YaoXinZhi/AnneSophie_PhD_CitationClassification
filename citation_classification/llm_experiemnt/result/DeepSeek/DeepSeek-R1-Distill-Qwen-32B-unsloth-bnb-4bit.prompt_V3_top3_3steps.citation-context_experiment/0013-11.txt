Okay, so I need to figure out the top three rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by understanding the context. The passage mentions that the citation refers to a study where the authors found that fast multiplication rates and high concentration of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains have been reported in young developing leaves and roots of infected daisy plants. It also notes conflicting results for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima.

First, I'll extract the context. The citation is discussing two studies: one where they found high concentrations in daisy plants and another where conflicting results were found in Euphorbia pulcherrima. So the context is about comparing two studies' findings.

Next, identifying the general intent. The citation is comparing two studies, so it's a comparative intent. Specifically, it's comparing explanations or claims between the two cited studies. That points towards CoCoXY.

Now, ranking the specific rhetorical classes. The primary class is definitely CoCoXY because it's directly comparing two cited works. Then, looking at the context, the passage is pointing out conflicting results, which could also be seen as a form of comparison of results, so CoCoRes is next. Lastly, since the passage is highlighting a contradiction, it might also be pointing out a weakness in one of the studies, making Weakness a possible third choice.

1. CoCoXY  
2. CoCoRes  
3. Weakness
