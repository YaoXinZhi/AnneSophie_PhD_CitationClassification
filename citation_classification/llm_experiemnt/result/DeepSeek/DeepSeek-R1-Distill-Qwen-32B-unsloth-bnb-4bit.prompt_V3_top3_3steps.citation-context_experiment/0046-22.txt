Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand the task clearly. I'm supposed to classify a citation in a scientific article into one of several predefined rhetorical classes. The passage provided is about a study on the effect of magnetic treatment on calcite scale formation. The citation in question is @@CITATION@@, which refers to a previous study by the same authors.

Step 1: Extract the context discussing the citation. The relevant sentence is: "Our previous research @@CITATION@@ has shown that the formation of the hard calcite scale on the surfaces exposed to hard water can be successfully prevented with the applied magnetic field." The next sentence mentions that the purpose of the current work is to understand the mechanism behind this effect.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation is referring to prior work that demonstrated the effectiveness of magnetic treatment. The current study builds on this by exploring the underlying mechanism. This suggests that the citation is used to establish a foundation for the current research, indicating a "Foundational" intent.

Step 3: Rank the specific rhetorical classes. The most appropriate class is "Basis" because it's referencing prior work that provides the foundation for the current study. "Support" could be considered since the previous work supports the current research, but it's more about motivation than direct support. "Neutral" might apply if the citation were purely descriptive, but here it's clearly setting up the research motivation. Therefore, the top three classes are Basis, Support, and Neutral.

1. Basis  
2. Support  
3. Neutral
