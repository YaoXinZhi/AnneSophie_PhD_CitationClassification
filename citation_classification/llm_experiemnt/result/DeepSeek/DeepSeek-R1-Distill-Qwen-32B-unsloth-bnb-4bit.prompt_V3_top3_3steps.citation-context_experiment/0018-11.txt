Okay, let's try to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. First, I need to extract the context around the citation to understand its intent. The passage mentions that the study found high concentrations of two strains in young leaves and roots, but conflicting results were described for another phytoplasma. The citation is used to highlight these conflicting results between two studies.

Now, looking at the general intent. The citation is comparing two studies with each other, not directly with the current paper. This suggests a comparative intent, specifically pointing out conflicting results between the cited works. So, the general intent falls under Comparative.

Next, I need to assign the top three rhetorical classes. The most appropriate is CoCoXY because it's comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies. Since the passage is pointing out a conflict, it's about contrasting findings. 

The second might be Support, but wait, noâ€”the citation isn't supporting the current paper's findings but rather showing a conflict. Alternatively, Neutral could be considered since it's just stating conflicting results without necessarily supporting or opposing. But since the intent is to compare, CoCoXY is first, and then perhaps Neutral because it's a neutral observation of conflicting results without a direct comparison to the current work.

Wait, maybe I should reconsider. The example for CoCoXY mentions conflicting results between two studies, which is exactly what's happening here. So the primary class is CoCoXY. Then, since the citation is used to present conflicting findings without directly comparing to the current paper, Neutral might be second. However, another angle is that the citation is being used to show a comparison between the two studies, so perhaps CoCoXY is the main, and then maybe Support if the current paper is using this to support their own findings, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, Neutral could be the second if the citation is just providing background without a direct comparison.

Wait, the passage is stating that conflicting results were described, so it's more about the comparison between the two studies rather than supporting or being neutral. So perhaps CoCoXY is first, and then maybe Weakness if the conflicting results point out a limitation in the studies, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it's just a neutral presentation of conflicting findings, so Neutral could be second. 

Hmm, I think the top three would be CoCoXY as the primary, followed by Neutral because it's a neutral statement of conflicting results, and then perhaps Weakness if the conflict implies some issues with the studies. Alternatively, Neutral might be the second, and then Weakness as third. But I'm not entirely certain. I'll go with CoCoXY as first, then Neutral, and then Weakness.
