Alright, I need to determine the top three rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by understanding the context and the intent of the citation.

Step 1: Extract the context discussing the citation. The passage mentions that the citation is used to support the finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly, referencing previous studies on fleas and ticks. 

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation is used to back up the current study's findings, indicating a supportive intent.

Step 3: Rank the specific rhetorical classes. Since the citation supports the current work, "Support" is the most appropriate. "Similar" is next because it shows a similarity in findings across studies. Lastly, "Neutral" could apply as it's a straightforward reference without criticism or comparison.
