Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation marked @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific passage. Let me start by understanding the context and the task.

First, the passage is about plant health, specifically discussing the use of magnetic water treatment devices in the USA since 1975. The citation is used to support this statement. 

Step 1: Extract the context. The sentence is: "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@." The context is about the spread of magnetic water treatment devices in the USA starting from 1975.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation is providing evidence or support for the statement about the spread of these devices. It's not comparing methods or results, nor is it motivating future research or pointing out weaknesses. It's simply backing up the claim with a reference.

Step 3: Assign rhetorical classes. The most appropriate class is Support because the citation is used to back up the statement. Neutral is next because the citation is used descriptively without additional analysis. Usage might be a stretch, but it's less relevant here since it's more about the spread rather than a method or tool being used. So, the top three are Support, Neutral, and then maybe Weakness if there's any doubt, but I think Weakness isn't applicable here.

1. Support  
2. Neutral  
3. Usage
