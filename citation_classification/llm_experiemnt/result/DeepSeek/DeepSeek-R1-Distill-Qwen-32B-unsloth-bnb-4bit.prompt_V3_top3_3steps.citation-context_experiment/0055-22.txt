Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by extracting the context around the citation.

The passage says: "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@."

Hmm, the context here is about the spread of magnetic water treatment devices in the USA since 1975. The citation is just providing a fact about when and where these devices started becoming popular. It doesn't seem to be supporting or comparing anything; it's just stating a historical fact.

Looking at the general intent, this seems descriptive. The citation is used to inform the reader about the spread of these devices without any further analysis or comparison. So, the intent is Neutral.

Now, for the specific rhetorical classes. The passage isn't using the citation to compare methods or results, so CoCoGM, CoCoRes, or CoCoXY aren't applicable. It's not supporting or motivating anything either. It's purely descriptive. Therefore, the top class is Neutral.

Since there's no comparison, motivation, or support involved, the other classes like Basis, Motivation, Future, Support, Similar, Usage, or Weakness don't fit here. So, the top three are all Neutral, but since we can only list three, it's just Neutral repeated, but I think the instruction is to pick the top three, even if they are the same. But maybe I should consider if any other classes could apply, but in this case, they don't.

So, the three classes are all Neutral.

1. Neutral  
2. Neutral  
3. Neutral
