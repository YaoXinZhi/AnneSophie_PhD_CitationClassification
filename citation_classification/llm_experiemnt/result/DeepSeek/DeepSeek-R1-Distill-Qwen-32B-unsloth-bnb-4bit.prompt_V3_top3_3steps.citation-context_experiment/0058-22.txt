Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific passage. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage says: "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@@."

From this, the context is about supporting the current study's findings with another study. The authors are pointing out that their results align with previous research on bacterial communities in fleas and ticks.

Next, identifying the general intent. The citation is used to back up the current findings, so it's supportive. Looking at the predefined classes, Support and Similar seem relevant here because the authors are showing that their results are consistent with others.

Now, assigning the top three rhetorical classes. The primary class is Support because the citation directly confirms the current findings. Similar is next because it highlights the similarity in results. Neutral could be third since the citation isn't used for comparison or motivation but is just stating a fact in support.

1. Support  
2. Similar  
3. Neutral
