Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage says, "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@@."

Okay, so the context is talking about their finding being supported by other studies. The citation is pointing out that similar results have been found in other insect-associated bacteria. The authors are saying that their results align with what's been observed in fleas and ticks, where the host influenced bacterial communities, not the environment.

Now, identifying the general intent. Since they're using the citation to back up their own findings, it seems like it's a supportive intent. They're confirming their results with prior work.

Looking at the predefined classes, Support is about citing to confirm their work. Similar is about pointing out similarities in results or observations. Neutral is just a descriptive mention without supporting or comparing.

So, the top class would be Support because they're directly supporting their findings. Then, Similar because they're highlighting that other studies have shown the same pattern. Neutral might come in third if it's just a mention without much comparison or support beyond that.

Wait, but the example given for Similar is exactly this kind of situationâ€”pointing out that other studies have similar results. So maybe Similar is more appropriate than Support. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. The passage says "supported by recent cross-taxon investigations," which sounds like Support. But the example for Similar is also about supporting findings with similar results. Maybe both are applicable, but I think Support is more direct because they're explicitly saying their findings are supported by others.

Alternatively, perhaps Similar is the primary because they're showing that the pattern is consistent across different insects, not just supporting their own results but highlighting the similarity across studies.

I think I'll go with Support as the primary because the citation is used to back up their own findings. Then Similar because it's showing the same pattern elsewhere. Neutral would be third because it's not just a neutral mention; they're actively using it to support their work.

1. Support  
2. Similar  
3. Neutral
