Okay, so I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific passage into three rhetorical classes. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the citation reports on the multiplication rates and concentration of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains in young leaves and roots of infected daisy plants. It also notes conflicting results from another study regarding a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima.

Next, I need to identify the general intent of this citation. The context is comparing two studies: one that reports high multiplication rates and another that describes conflicting results. This suggests that the citation is used to compare or contrast two cited studies with each other, not directly with the citing paper.

Looking at the predefined classes, CoCoXY fits because it's about comparing explanations or claims between two cited works. The passage is pointing out conflicting results between two studies, which is a form of comparison.

Now, for the top three rhetorical classes. The primary class is definitely CoCoXY since it's about comparing two studies. The next possible class could be Neutral because the citation is presenting information without necessarily supporting or opposing either study. Lastly, Support might be a stretch if the citation is used to back up the current paper's findings, but it seems more about presenting conflicting information rather than supporting.

So, the top three classes are CoCoXY, Neutral, and Support.

1. CoCoXY  
2. Neutral  
3. Support
