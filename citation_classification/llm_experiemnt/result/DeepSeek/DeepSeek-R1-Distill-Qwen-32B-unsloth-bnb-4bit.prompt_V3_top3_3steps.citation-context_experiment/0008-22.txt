Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by carefully reading the passage to understand the context where the citation is used.

The passage says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@."

Hmm, the key part here is that the current study's results are being compared to the results of previous experiments. The authors are pointing out a difference in outcomes between their work and the cited work. That makes me think about the different rhetorical classes.

Looking at the definitions, CoCoRes is about comparing results or findings between the current paper and the cited work. Since the passage directly states that their results differ from the cited ones, CoCoRes seems very relevant.

Next, I should consider if there are other possible classes. The passage doesn't mention anything about the methods or goals of the cited work, so CoCoGM or CoCoXY might not fit here. It's specifically about results, so CoCoRes is the primary one.

I don't see any indication that the citation is used for motivation, future research, support, similarity, usage, weakness, or neutral purposes. The focus is purely on the comparison of results.

So, the top class is definitely CoCoRes. There might not be a second or third class here because the context is quite specific. But since I need to provide three, I'll have to think if any other classes could apply in a minor way.

Maybe Neutral could be a stretch if the citation is just stating a fact without much comparison, but the context clearly shows a comparison of results. So Neutral isn't the best fit. Similarly, Support or Similar might not apply because it's pointing out a difference rather than agreement or similarity.

Therefore, the top three would be CoCoRes as the first, and then perhaps Neutral and Support as the next possible, but they don't fit as well. Alternatively, if no other classes apply, I might have to list the same class again, but that's not ideal.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The passage is clearly comparing results, so CoCoRes is first. Maybe the next could be Neutral if it's just a statement without strong comparison, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if there's no other context, maybe just list CoCoRes and then two Neutral, but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, if the citation is also used to support the current findings by contrasting, maybe Support could be second. But I'm not certain. I think the main class is CoCoRes, and the others are less applicable.

1. CoCoRes  
2. Neutral  
3. Support
