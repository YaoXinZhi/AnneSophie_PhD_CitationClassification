Okay, I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage into the top three rhetorical classes. Let me go through the steps.

First, I extract the context around the citation. The passage says that the study by @@CITATION@@ found high concentrations of a specific strain in infected plants. This is compared to another study that reported conflicting results. So the context is about comparing two studies.

Next, I identify the general intent. The citation is used to contrast two results, so it's a comparative intent. Specifically, it's comparing results from two different studies, not with the current paper.

Looking at the predefined classes, the most appropriate would be CoCoXY since it's comparing two cited studies. Then, since the comparison is about results, CoCoRes is next. Neutral is third because the citation is used descriptively without supporting or opposing the current paper.

1. CoCoXY  
2. CoCoRes  
3. Neutral
