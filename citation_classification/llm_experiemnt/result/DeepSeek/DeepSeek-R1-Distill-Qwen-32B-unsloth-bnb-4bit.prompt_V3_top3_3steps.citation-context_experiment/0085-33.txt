Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let's start by extracting the context around the citation.

Looking at the passage, it says: "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@@."

Alright, so the main point here is that the authors are supporting their finding with another study. They mention that their results are consistent with recent cross-taxon investigations, specifically pointing out that the arthropod host influenced bacterial assemblages, similar to their own findings.

Now, identifying the general intent. The citation is used to back up their results, so it's supportive. That points towards the Support category. But let's look deeper.

The example given for Support is when a citation supports or confirms the work of the citing authors. Here, they are directly stating that their finding is supported by another study, which fits Support.

But wait, could it also be Similar? Because they mention that other studies show similar patterns. The example for Similar is when a citation points out a similarity in results or phenomena. In this case, they're saying that their finding is supported by similar findings in other studies, so Similar might also apply.

And what about CoCoRes? CoCoRes is when the citation compares results. Here, they are comparing their results with those of another study, showing that the host governs bacterial assemblages, which is similar. So, CoCoRes could also be a fit.

But the primary intent seems to be supporting their own findings, so Support would be the most appropriate. Then, since they're pointing out a similarity in results, Similar would be next. CoCoRes, which is a comparison of results, might come third because while they are comparing, the main purpose is to support their own work rather than to contrast or extensively compare.

So, the top three rhetorical classes would be Support, Similar, and CoCoRes.

1. Support  
2. Similar  
3. CoCoRes
