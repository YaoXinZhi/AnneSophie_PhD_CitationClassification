Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by carefully reading the context provided.

The passage says: "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@@."

Alright, so the authors are discussing their findings about insect hosts affecting bacterial communities. They mention that their results are supported by recent cross-taxon investigations, specifically citing another study where arthropod hosts influenced bacterial assemblages, while rodent hosts and environmental factors didn't.

First, I'll extract the context. The key part is that the citation is used to support the authors' findings. They state that their results are "supported by" recent studies, which suggests the citation is providing backing evidence.

Next, I need to identify the general intent. Since the citation is supporting their findings, the general intent is Supportive, which maps to the Support class.

Now, looking at the predefined classes, Support is one. Are there others? Let me check. The passage isn't comparing methods or results with another study, so CoCoGM or CoCoRes might not fit. It's not pointing out a similarity beyond supporting, so Similar isn't the primary here. There's no mention of future directions or weaknesses, so Future or Weakness don't apply. The citation isn't being used to introduce a new idea or method, so Usage isn't relevant. It's not a foundational work either, so Basis is out.

So the primary class is Support. Are there any secondary classes? The citation is also pointing out a similarity in findings across different insect-associated bacteria, so Similar could be a secondary class. However, the main intent is support, so Support is first. Maybe Neutral isn't applicable because the citation is clearly used to support, not just describe.

Wait, the example given for Similar is when the citation points out a similarity in results. Here, the authors say their finding is supported by another study, which is a form of Similar but more specifically Support. So I think the top three would be Support as the primary, then Similar as a secondary, and perhaps Neutral as a third, though Neutral might not fit since the citation is actively supporting. Alternatively, maybe Neutral isn't the best fit here.

Alternatively, could it be that the citation is both supporting and similar? I'm a bit confused. The example given for Support is when the citation supports the current work, which is exactly what's happening here. So the main class is Support. Maybe the second is Similar because it's a cross-taxon investigation showing similar patterns. The third might be Neutral if it's just a mention without any critical or comparative aspect, but in this case, it's more than a neutral mention—it's supporting.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The main class is Support. The next could be Similar because it's showing a similar pattern across different insects. The third might be Neutral if there's no other context, but since it's used to support, Neutral might not be the best. Alternatively, maybe Basis if it's foundational, but I don't think so here.

I think the top three are Support, Similar, and perhaps Neutral as a stretch, but maybe it's more accurate to have Support as 1, Similar as 2, and then maybe CoCoRes if comparing results, but the passage doesn't directly compare results—it just says it's supported by another study. So I'm leaning towards Support, Similar, and Neutral.

1. Support  
2. Similar  
3. Neutral
