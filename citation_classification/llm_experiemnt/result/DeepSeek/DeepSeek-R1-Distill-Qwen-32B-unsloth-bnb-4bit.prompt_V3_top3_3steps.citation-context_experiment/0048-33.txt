Okay, I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage into the top three rhetorical classes. Let me start by understanding the context.

The passage says: "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@@."

So, the citation is supporting the current study's findings. The authors are pointing out that their results align with previous research. That sounds like the Support class because they're confirming their work with prior studies.

Next, the passage mentions that the cited work is a cross-taxon investigation, which might imply a similarity in methodology or results. So, Similar could be another class because they're showing that other studies have found similar patterns.

Is there any comparison involved? The passage doesn't compare their methods or goals but rather states that other studies support their findings. So CoCoRes or CoCoXY might not fit here because it's more about supporting than comparing.

Motivation or Future? No, because the citation isn't introducing a need for future work or justifying why the study was done. It's about confirming their results.

Usage? No, they're not using a method or tool from the cited work. Weakness? They're not criticizing the cited work. Neutral? It's not just a descriptive mention without supporting.

So the top classes are Support, Similar, and maybe Neutral if it's just a mention without strong support. But since it's clearly supporting, Neutral is less likely.

1. Support  
2. Similar  
3. Neutral
