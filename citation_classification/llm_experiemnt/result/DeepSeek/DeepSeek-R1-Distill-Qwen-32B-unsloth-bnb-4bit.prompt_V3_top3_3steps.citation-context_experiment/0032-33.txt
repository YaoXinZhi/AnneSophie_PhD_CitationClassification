Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific passage. Let me start by understanding the context and the task.

First, the user provided a context where the citation is embedded in a sentence about the multiplication rates of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains in young leaves and roots of infected daisy plants. The sentence mentions conflicting results from another study. 

Step 1: Extract the context. The relevant part is that the citation is pointing out conflicting results from another study regarding the same topic. So the context is about comparing results from different studies.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation is comparing two studies' results, which suggests a comparative intent. Specifically, it's comparing explanations or claims between two cited works, not necessarily with the citing paper. 

Step 3: Rank the rhetorical classes. The most appropriate class here is CoCoXY because it's comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies. Since the context is about conflicting results, it's not a direct comparison of results with the current paper, which would be CoCoRes. It's also not about methods or goals, so CoCoGM isn't the best fit. 

Next, the second most appropriate might be Support if the citation is used to back up a point, but in this case, it's more about highlighting a conflict rather than supporting. Alternatively, Neutral could be considered if the citation is just stating a fact without comparison. But since the context mentions conflicting results, it's more about comparison than neutral statement.

Wait, maybe Neutral isn't the best second choice. Let me think again. The primary class is CoCoXY. The second could be Neutral if the citation is just providing information without a direct comparison to the current paper. However, the example given in CoCoXY shows that it's about comparing two cited studies, which aligns with the context.

So, the top three would be CoCoXY as the primary, then perhaps Neutral as a secondary if the citation is used neutrally to state conflicting results without comparing to the current study. But since the context is about conflicting results, it's more about comparison than just a neutral statement. Maybe the third could be Weakness if the citation is pointing out a limitation in previous studies, but that's not explicitly clear here.

Alternatively, if the citation is just stating conflicting results without comparing to the current paper, it might be Neutral. But I think the main point is that it's comparing two studies, so CoCoXY is first. The second might be Support if the current paper is using this to support their findings, but the example given doesn't show that. The third could be Neutral.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The primary is CoCoXY. Since the citation is used to point out conflicting results between two studies, it's a comparison between cited works, so CoCoXY is 1. The second could be Neutral because it's providing context without necessarily supporting or comparing to the current paper. The third might be Weakness if the conflicting results highlight a problem, but that's a stretch.

Alternatively, maybe the second is Support if the current paper is using this to support their argument about conflicting findings. But I'm not sure. I think the best approach is to list CoCoXY as 1, then Neutral as 2, and perhaps Similar as 3 if it's pointing out a similarity in conflicting results.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me look back at the definitions. CoCoXY is when comparing two cited studies. The example given is about conflicting results, which fits CoCoXY. So 1. CoCoXY. Then, if the current paper is using this to support their findings, it could be Support, but the example doesn't show that. Alternatively, it's just a neutral mention of conflicting results, so Neutral could be 2. The third might be Weakness if the conflict points out a limitation, but that's not clear.

Alternatively, if the current paper is using this citation to show that their results are similar to one of the studies, it could be Similar. But again, the example doesn't specify that.

I think the best ranking is:

1. CoCoXY (because it's comparing two studies' results)
2. Neutral (as it's just stating conflicting results without direct comparison to the current paper)
3. Weakness (if the conflict implies a limitation in previous studies)
</think>

1. CoCoXY  
2. Neutral  
3. Weakness
