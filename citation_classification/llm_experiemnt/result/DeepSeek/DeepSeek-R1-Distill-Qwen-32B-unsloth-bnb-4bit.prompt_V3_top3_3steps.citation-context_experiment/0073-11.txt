Okay, I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by understanding the context. The passage is about plant health, and the citation is mentioned in a way that's part of a discussion on how certain studies have shown conflicting results regarding the multiplication rates of phytoplasmas in different plant species.

So, the context is about comparing results from two studies. One study by Wei et al. (2004) reports high multiplication rates in young leaves and roots, while another by Saracco et al. (2006) found conflicting results in a different plant. The citation @@CITATION@@ is used to highlight this discrepancy.

Looking at the predefined classes, I need to determine which ones fit best. The passage is comparing the results of two studies, so that points towards a comparative intent. Specifically, it's comparing the explanations or claims made by these two studies. That makes me think of CoCoXY, which is used when comparing two cited studies with each other, not with the citing paper.

Next, since the passage is pointing out a similarity in the results (both looking at phytoplasma multiplication but with differing outcomes), it might also fall under Similar. However, the main focus is on the comparison rather than just similarity. 

Additionally, the passage is using these citations to support the point about conflicting results, so Support could be another class. But the primary intent is comparison, so Support might be a secondary consideration.

So, the top three classes would be CoCoXY as the most appropriate, followed by Similar, and then Support. I don't see any elements of Motivation, Future, Usage, Weakness, or Neutral here because the citation isn't introducing new research directions, using a method, criticizing the studies, or providing a neutral fact. It's purely about comparing and contrasting the results of the two studies.

1. CoCoXY  
2. Similar  
3. Support
