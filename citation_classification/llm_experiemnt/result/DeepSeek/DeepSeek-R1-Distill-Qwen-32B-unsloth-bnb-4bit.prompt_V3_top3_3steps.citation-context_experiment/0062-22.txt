Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by extracting the context. The passage mentions that the citation reports conflicting results about a phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima. It's comparing these findings with previous studies by Wei et al. and Saracco et al. 

Now, looking at the general intent, the citation is being used to compare two studies. The authors are pointing out that there's a conflict between the results of these studies. So, the main intent here is comparative. 

Next, I need to assign the specific rhetorical classes. The citation is comparing two cited studies (Wei et al. and Saracco et al.) with each other, not with the current paper. That fits the CoCoXY category because it's about comparing explanations or claims between two cited works. 

Since the citation is highlighting a conflict, it's also showing a contrast between the results, which could relate to CoCoRes (comparison of results). However, since it's comparing two studies rather than the current work, CoCoXY is more appropriate. 

There's no mention of motivation, future directions, support, or usage here, so those categories don't fit. The citation isn't pointing out a weakness or similarity either. It's purely about comparing two cited works. 

So, the top three classes would be CoCoXY as the most appropriate, followed by CoCoRes, and then Neutral since it's a descriptive comparison without necessarily supporting or opposing the current paper.

1. CoCoXY  
2. CoCoRes  
3. Neutral
