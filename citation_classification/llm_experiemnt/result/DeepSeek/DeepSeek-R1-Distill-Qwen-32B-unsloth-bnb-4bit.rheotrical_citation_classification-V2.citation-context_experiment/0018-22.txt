Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in the given text. Let me start by reading the passage carefully. 

The text is about Psylla/Cacopsylla pyricola and mentions records from Korea. It discusses two studies: Kwon (1983) and then cites Kim et al. (2007), Kang et al. (2012), Park et al. (2013), and Park et al. (2016). It states that these records concern two species, C. maculatili and C. jukyungi. 

Looking at the context, the author is pointing out that these studies report records of specific species. The sentence structure seems to be listing prior studies that have identified these species in Korea. The usage here doesn't seem to be supporting, comparing, or motivating; it's more of a neutral reference to prior findings. 

I should check the predefined classes. The 'Neutral' class applies when the citation is used in a neutral, descriptive way without supporting or comparing. Since the author is simply noting that these prior studies report findings without critique or further argument, it fits this category. There's no indication that these citations are used to support a claim, compare methods, or highlight weaknesses. It's just a factual mention of where the species were reported. 

So, the rhetorical class here is Neutral.
