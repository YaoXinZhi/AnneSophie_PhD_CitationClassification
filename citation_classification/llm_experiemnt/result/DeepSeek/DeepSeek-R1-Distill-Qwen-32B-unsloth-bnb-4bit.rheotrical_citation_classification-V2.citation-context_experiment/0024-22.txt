Okay, let's try to figure out the correct rhetorical class for this citation. The passage mentions that the two different pairs of ribosomal primers used were (CITSEG) and another one. So, the citation here is pointing to a specific method or tool used in the study. Looking at the predefined classes, the 'Usage' class refers to when a citation is used for a method, tool, dataset, etc., that is directly used in the current study. So yes, this fits because the primers are part of the experimental setup they're using. I don't think it's 'Support' because they're not citing to back up their findings, just indicating where they got their methods from. So the class should be 'Usage'.
