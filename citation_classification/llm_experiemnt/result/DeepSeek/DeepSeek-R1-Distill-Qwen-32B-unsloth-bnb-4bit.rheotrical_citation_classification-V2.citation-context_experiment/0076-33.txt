Okay, I need to classify the cited work (CITSEG) in the provided text into one of the rhetorical classes. Let's break down the passage step by step.

The passage states: "As facultative endosymbionts can render insects less susceptible to management using parasitoids, pathogens, host plant resistance, and insecticides type=""bibr"" target=""#b39"">(Oliver et al. 2003</ref> type=""bibr"" target=""#b45"">, Scarborough et al. 2005</ref> type=""bibr"" target=""#b27"">, Hansen et al. 2007</ref>" (CITSEG) "<ref type=""bibr"" target=""#b32"">, Kikuchi et al. 2012</ref><ref type=""bibr"" target=""#b49"">, Su et al. 2015)</ref>, the documentation...".

So, the authors are citing multiple studies by Oliver, Scarborough, Hansen, Kikuchi, and Su. They are using these citations to support a claim that facultative endosymbionts make insects less susceptible to certain management strategies.

Looking at the rhetorical classes:

- **Support**: This is when the citation is used to back up a claim or finding, aligning with the author's argument. Here, the authors are using the cited studies as evidence to support their point about the impact of endosymbionts on pest management.

Other classes don't fit as well. It's not a **Basis**, since the cited works aren't laying the foundation for their study but rather supporting a specific point. It's not a **CoCoGM**, **CoCoRes**, or **CoCoXY** because theyâ€™re not comparing methods or results but rather using the citations to back up their assertion. It's not about **Motivation**, **Neutral**, **Similar**, **Usage**, or **Weakness** either.

So, the best fit is **Support**.
