Okay, let's try to figure out the rhetorical class for this citation. The passage says that in Italy, the transmission of the PD agent by C. pyri was reported in a 1991 study by Lemoine. The context is discussing how different vectors have been found to transmit the disease in various regions. The sentence uses the citation to show that the same agent was found in France and Italy, indicating a pattern. So the citation is pointing out a similarity between the findings in France and Italy. That matches the "Similar" class because it's highlighting a shared result or observation.
