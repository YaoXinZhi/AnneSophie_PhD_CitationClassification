Okay, let's try to figure out the correct rhetorical class for the given passage. The passage is: "Chinese and Taiwanese Cacopsylla chinensis sequences [...] (Lee et al., 2007) (CITSEG) together form well-supported clusters in the NJ trees based on COI-tRNA leu -COII and 16S rDNA gene fragments (fig. 2)."

The task is to classify the citation (CITSEG) into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. First, I need to understand the context and the role of the citation here. The sentence is presenting results from the current study, stating that sequences form clusters based on certain gene fragments. The citation (Lee et al., 2007) is mentioned right after the species name. 

Looking at the classes, I need to see which one fits best. The 'Support' class is used when the citation supports the current claim or reinforces the authors' findings. In this case, the authors are presenting their results and are likely using the cited study to back up their findings. The fact that the sequences form well-supported clusters might be consistent with what Lee et al. found, so the citation is being used to support the current results.

Alternatively, could it be 'Usage'? That's when the cited work is used for methods, datasets, etc. But here, it seems more about supporting the findings rather than using their methods or data. 

Looking at the example for 'Support': "All subscales were consistent with previous research, particularly that of (CITSEG) also using a U.S. sample." Here, it's similar because it's presenting findings consistent with prior work, so 'Support' seems applicable.

Another possibility is 'Neutral', but the usage here isn't neutral; it's supporting the current results by referencing prior work. So, 'Support' is more accurate.

The citation is used to support the current findings by referencing prior research, aligning with the 'Support' class.

**Answer: Support**
