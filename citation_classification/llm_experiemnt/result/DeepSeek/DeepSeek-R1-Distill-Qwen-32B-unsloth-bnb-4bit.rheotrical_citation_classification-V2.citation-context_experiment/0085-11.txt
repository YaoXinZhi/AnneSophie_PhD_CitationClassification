Alright, I need to determine the rhetorical class for the citation (CITSEG) in the given passage. Let me read the passage carefully.

The passage says: "A previous report detected WX in pear by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (CITSEG), but these results were never repeated using DNA hybridization (B. C. Kirkpatrick, unpublished results) or PCR..." 

Here, the authors are mentioning a previous finding by CITSEG about detecting WX in pear using ELISA. However, they also note that these results couldn't be replicated using other methods like DNA hybridization or PCR. 

Looking at the classes, I think the citation is being used to point out a similarity or perhaps a lack thereof. They are not directly supporting their own findings but rather noting that despite the previous report, their methods didn't replicate the results. 

Wait, maybe it's CoCoRes because they are contrasting the results of CITSEG with their own findings, showing that while CITSEG found something, their attempts didn't replicate it. So the citation is being used to compare the results.
