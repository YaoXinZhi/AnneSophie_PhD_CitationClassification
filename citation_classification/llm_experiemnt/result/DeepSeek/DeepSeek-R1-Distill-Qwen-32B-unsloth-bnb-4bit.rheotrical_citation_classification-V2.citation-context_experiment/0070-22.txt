Alright, I need to determine the rhetorical class for the citation in the given passage. The passage is a bit complex, so I'll break it down.

The text starts by mentioning that results were confirmed by Yvon et al. in a case study. Then it contrasts with Carraro et al., noting that they didn't find ESFY-infected wild P. mahaleb but later found high infection rates. It mentions that as the authors didn't find infected P. spinosa, they concluded that P. mahaleb is a key factor. Finally, the present study conducted monitoring to elucidate presence and distribution.

The citation in question is referring to Carraro et al. in the context where their earlier findings are mentioned, then their later findings are cited. The passage is comparing the results of Carraro et al. over time, showing that their initial findings didn't find infections but later did. So, the citation is used to compare or contrast the results of the cited work with others or within itself.

Looking at the rhetorical classes, CoCoRes is for comparing results. Also, the citation is used to contrast the earlier and later findings, which fits this class.
