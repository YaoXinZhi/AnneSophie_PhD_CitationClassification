Okay, I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation (CITSEG) in the provided passage. Let me go through this step by step.

First, the passage is about the spread of a pathogen called ESFY. It mentions various locations where it has been detected, citing different studies from 2000 to 2016. The passage also mentions that its highest spread is in the Mediterranean basin and discusses its northern border, citing specific studies for each country.

Looking at the part in question: "to Poland (CITSEG) . " In Germany, the first detection of the agent in different Prunus species has already been reported in 1992 by <ref type=""bibr"">Lederer and Seem√ºller. Carraro et al. (1998)</ref> identified the psyllid species Cacopsylla pruni (Scopoli) as vector for 'Ca." 

So, the citation (CITSEG) is in the context of mentioning where ESFY has been detected in Poland. The other citations around it are also about detection in specific locations. 

Now, looking at the rhetorical classes, I need to determine which one fits. The options include Support, Basis, CoCoGM, etc. 

In this case, the citation is simply providing evidence that ESFY occurs in Poland. It's directly supporting the statement about the spread of ESFY. The author isn't comparing methods, goals, or results with other studies; they're just confirming that it's present in that location.

So, this seems to fit the 'Support' class, as it's used to back up the claim about the geographical distribution of ESFY.
