Alright, I'm trying to determine the rhetorical class of the citation (CITSEG) in the given passage. Let me read the passage carefully.

The passage starts by mentioning the method used for nucleic acid extraction, referencing Doyle and Doyle [84]. It states, "Due to irregular distribution of 'Ca. P. pyri' in the apex (CITSEG), in part infection status..." This part is explaining why they adjusted their method. The citation here is referring to a previous study by Doyle and Doyle, which the current study is based on. They are using this citation to ground their method, showing that their approach is built upon established research.

Looking at the predefined classes, "Basis" is used when the cited work is the intellectual foundation of the current research. The passage clearly indicates that their method is based on Doyle and Doyle's work, contributing directly to the new solution.

Another option could be "Usage," but that's for when a method or tool is directly used. Here, the citation is more about establishing the foundation rather than just using a tool. The passage isn't just referencing a method; it's explaining that their approach is built on prior work.

So, the most appropriate class is "Basis."

Basis

The citation (CITSEG) refers to Doyle and Doyle's work as the foundation for the method used, indicating that the current research is built upon their prior work.
