Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in the given passage. Let me read the passage again:

"Gaps and ambiguities were removed from the final dataset. "Phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analyses were conducted by using the neighbour-joining program of the genetic analysis software MEGA, version 2.1" (CITSEG). The data were resampled 500 times and bootstrap percentage values are given at the nodes of the tree."

The citation here describes the software and the method used for the analyses. The phrase "by using the neighbour-joining program of the genetic analysis software MEGA, version 2.1" clearly refers to the method or tool employed in the study. So, the cited work is being referenced for its methodological approach, which is then directly used in the current study.

Looking at the list of rhetorical classes, the "Usage" class is for when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup used in the current study. Since the citation here mentions the specific software and method used, it fits the "Usage" category.
