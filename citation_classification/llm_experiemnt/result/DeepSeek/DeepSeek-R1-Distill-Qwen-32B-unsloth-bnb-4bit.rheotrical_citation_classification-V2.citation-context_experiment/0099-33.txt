Okay, let's try to figure out the rhetorical class for the given passage. The task is to classify each citation (marked as CITSEG) into one of the predefined classes based on how it's used in the text.

Looking at the passage, the sentence where CITSEG is used is: "Blodgett et al. (CITSEG) noted that the frequency and severity of pear decline symptoms did not vary with the scion varieties..." 

I need to determine the rhetorical role here. The author is citing Blodgett et al. to support a point they're makingâ€”specifically, that the scion varieties don't affect the severity of pear decline. The use of the citation is to provide evidence backing their claim. They're not comparing methods, discussing future directions, or merely mentioning the work neutrally. Instead, they're using it to back up their assertion, which aligns with the 'Support' class. 

So, the classification for CITSEG in this context is Support.

Support

The citation is used to support the claim that scion varieties do not affect pear decline severity.
