Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in this passage. The passage says: "Liu and Gao (1993) found similar phloem structures in Malus and Pyrus in comparison to Prunus, too" (CITSEG). The SEs in Prunus were shorter and each SE was connected to 2 to 3 companion cells (CCs) in comparison to Malus and Pyrus."

First, I need to understand the context. The sentence is discussing the structure of phloem in different plants. The citation is used to compare the findings of Liu and Gao with the current study. They mention that Liu and Gao found similar structures in Malus and Pyrus compared to Prunus. Then, the current study points out a difference: SEs are shorter in Prunus and connected to fewer companion cells.

Looking at the rhetorical classes, I need to see which one fits. The key here is that the citation is being used to compare or contrast the cited work's results with the current paper's findings. The example given for CoCoRes is comparing results, which matches this scenario. So, I think the correct class is CoCoRes because the citation directly compares the phloem structures found in Liu and Gao's study to those in the current research.

The citation is used to directly compare the results of Liu and Gao's study with the current findings, highlighting similarities and differences in phloem structures across different plant genera. This fits the CoCoRes class, which involves comparing results between studies.
