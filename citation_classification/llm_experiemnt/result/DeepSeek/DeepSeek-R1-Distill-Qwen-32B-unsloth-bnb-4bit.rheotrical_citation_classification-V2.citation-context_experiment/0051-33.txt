Okay, I need to determine the rhetorical class for the citation (CITSEG) in the given passage. Let's read the passage carefully.

The passage talks about evaluating antisera and dot blot techniques for diagnosing MLOs. It lists various MLOs and their sources, then cites (CITSEG). After that, it explains the results of testing these MLOs with specific antisera and mentions the figures that illustrate these results.

Looking at the context, the citation is immediately followed by a list of MLOs with details about their purification and isolation. The passage seems to be using this citation as a reference to establish the sources of the MLOs they tested. 

Now, checking the rhetorical classes: Usage refers to citations that mention methods, tools, datasets, or setups used in the current study. The passage doesn't compare results, criticize, or motivate, but rather cites sources that provided the MLO samples used in their experiments. 

So, the citation is used to indicate where the MLOs came from, which is part of their methodology. Therefore, the correct class is Usage.
