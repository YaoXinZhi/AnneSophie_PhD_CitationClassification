Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in the given passage. The passage is a bit technical, but I'll break it down step by step. 

First, let me read through the passage again to understand the context and where the citation is placed. The text says:

"In 1995, groups of 50 individuals of C. pyri were collected from the same infected orchard in July, August and September, respectively, and were then analyzed by PCR." "For the analysis, the two different pairs of ribosomal primers used were: fPD/r0 1" (CITSEG) "and AP3/ AP5 <ref type=""bibr"" target=""#b2"">(Firrao et al., 1994)</ref> respectively." The DNA extraction from insects was according to Doyle and Doyle's procedure (1990)."

So, the citation in question is referring to the primers used in the PCR analysis. The passage mentions that two different pairs of ribosomal primers were used. The first one is "fPD/r0 1" (CITSEG), and the second one is AP3/AP5, cited as Firrao et al., 1994.

Now, I need to determine the rhetorical class for this citation. The options are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, Weakness.

I think the key here is to look at how the citation is used. The passage is describing the methodology of the current study. It's listing the specific tools or methods used in their experiment. The primers are a specific component of their PCR analysis.

Looking at the options, "Usage" seems to fit because it refers to when a citation is about a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup used in the current study. Here, the authors are referencing where they obtained their primers from, indicating that they're using that source's method or tool in their own work.

I don't think it's "Support" because they're not using this citation to back up a claim or argument; they're just stating that they used these primers from that source. It's also not "Basis" because the cited work isn't the foundation of their research, just a tool used in their methodology.

So, yes, "Usage" makes sense here because they're using the primers from the cited work as part of their experimental setup.
