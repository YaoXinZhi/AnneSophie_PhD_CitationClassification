Okay, I need to figure out the correct rhetorical class for the given citation in the passage. Let me read through the text carefully. The passage is about pear decline, its discovery, and transmission vectors. The citation in question is "(CITSEG)" which refers to Hibino and Schneider, 1970.

Looking at the sentence: "After 1970, mycoplasmalike bodies were detected in sieve tubes of pear trees affected with pear decline (CITSEG) and in the pear psylla vector of pear decline." It seems that this citation is providing evidence that mycoplasmalike bodies were found in both pear trees and their vectors. The authors are using this citation to support their statement about the detection.

The rhetorical class that fits this is 'Support', because the authors are citing previous work to confirm their findings. They're showing that Hibino and Schneider's work aligns with their own observations, reinforcing their argument about the presence of mycoplasmalike bodies.
