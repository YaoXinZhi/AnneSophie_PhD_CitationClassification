Alright, I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in this passage. Let me read through the text carefully.

So the passage mentions that DNA from fragment IH196 was used and that "Work by Jarausch et al. (1994 and 2000a) showed that this fragment contains three ORFs." The authors are using this information to support their own findings. 

Looking at the rhetorical classes, I need to see which one fits. The citation is providing a foundation or background that led to their work. They built upon this previous research, which is a key part of their argument. So the most appropriate class here is Basis because it's the intellectual foundation they're building upon.
