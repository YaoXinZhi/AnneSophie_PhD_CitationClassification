Alright, I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the given citation in the text. The passage is about Liberibacter solanacearum affecting plants like celery and carrot. It lists several citations, one of which is (CITSEG). The surrounding text mentions symptoms of CaLsol in carrot and celery, such as abnormal shoot proliferation, stem curling, discoloration, and root size reduction.

Looking at the list of classes, I need to see which one fits best. The citation is part of a list that seems to support the assertion about plant symptoms. So, this might be a 'Support' class because it provides evidence backing the claim about the symptoms.

But wait, the text doesn't explicitly state that it's supporting, just listing previous studies. Maybe it's 'Basis' if it's foundational. Or could it be 'Usage' if it's referring to a method? No, the symptoms are results, not methods. Alternatively, 'Neutral' if it's just a neutral mention.

Wait, the passage is showing that these symptoms have been noted in previous studies. So the cited works support the current description of symptoms. Therefore, the correct class is 'Support'.
