Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation (CITSEG) in the given passage. Let me read through the text carefully and then map it to the predefined classes.

The passage starts by stating that PYLR is found only in California despite peach plantings near pears elsewhere. Then it suggests a unique sub-strain causing disease in peach. It mentions "Based on the information obtained in this and previous studies (CITSEG) 'A. H. Purcell, unpublished data)'", which is the citation in question. 

Looking at the context, the citation is used to support the conclusion that pear growers are aware pears are the primary reservoir for PYLR. The authors are using the previous studies as evidence to back up their statement about pear growers' awareness and actions. 

So, the citation is serving as evidence to support the argument being made in the current paper. That aligns with the "Support" class, which is used when the citation reinforces a claim made by the authors.
