Alright, let's try to figure out the rhetorical class for the given citation. So, the passage is about pear decline and its symptoms. The citation is from EPPO 2019 and Steffek et al. 2011. 

Looking at the text, EPPO 2019 is cited after a statement about disease symptoms: "Generally, infected trees are characterised by fewer, smaller and leathery leaves, reduced terminal growth, diminished fertility and fruit size and eventually, death of trees." Then Steffek et al. 2011 is cited right after saying "In Austria, pear decline is widespread."

The rhetorical classes I need to consider are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, Weakness.

Hmm. The EPPO 2019 citation seems to support the description of disease symptoms. It's providing evidence that their description is correct, which aligns with the Support class because it's confirming the symptoms mentioned. 

Similarly, Steffek et al. 2011 is indicating the prevalence in Austria, which supports the claim that pear decline is widespread there, again supporting the statement.

Wait, are both citations being used to support the authors' claims? Let me check the exact wording. The first part describes symptoms and cites EPPO as support. The next sentence talks about prevalence in Austria and cites Steffek. So both seem to be supporting the points made by the authors.

Is there any comparison here? No, both are just backing up statements. So the most appropriate classes would be Support for both, but wait, the user's output only needs one label. But in the passage, there are two separate citations.

Looking back, the user provided an example with two citations but expects one class for (CITSEG). Hmm, perhaps each (CITSEG) should be considered separately. But in the given text, both are supporting. So maybe the correct label is Support for each. But the output expects one label. Maybe if both are Support, then choose Support.

Wait, in the response example, the user's model returned 'Support' when both citations were supporting. So perhaps in this case, it's Support.
