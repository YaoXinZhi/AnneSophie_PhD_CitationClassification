Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation (CITSEG) in the given text. Let me read through the passage carefully.

The passage talks about psyllid pests and their economic importance, mentioning their role as vectors for phytoplasma diseases. Then it mentions specific species of Cacopsylla and their association with certain diseases, citing Tedeschi & Alma 2004 as (CITSEG). 

Looking at the passage, the citation is used to support the statement about Cacopsylla melanoneura and C. picta being vectors of apple proliferation phytoplasma. It's presented as evidence confirming that these species are vectors, reinforcing the claim made by the authors. 

So, the rhetorical class here is Support because the citation is used to back up the authors' claim.
