Alright, I'm looking at this passage and trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation. The text mentions multiple references in the context of discussing pear psyllids in Korea. The citation in question is "e.g." followed by several authors with their works. 

The passage states that Shinji (1944) was the first to record C. pyrisuga in Korea, and others, including the cited work, repeated this finding. The use of "e.g." suggests that the cited work is being provided as an example to support the point that this record was repeated by various authors. 

The function here is to support the claim that the record was acknowledged by multiple researchers, reinforcing the credibility and the established nature of this information. Therefore, the rhetorical class should be "Support" because the citation is used to back up the assertion with multiple sources.
