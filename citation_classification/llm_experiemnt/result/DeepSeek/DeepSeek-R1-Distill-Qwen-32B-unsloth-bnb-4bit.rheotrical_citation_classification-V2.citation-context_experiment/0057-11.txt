Alright, I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the (CITSEG) in the given passage. The passage mentions "RFLP analysis was carried out as described previously" and cites Lorenz et al., 1995. I need to map this to one of the predefined classes.

First, I read through the passage. It's describing the methods used in the current study. Specifically, the RFLP analysis method is said to have been carried out as described previously in the cited work. 

Looking at the classes, "Usage" is when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup from the cited work that's directly used in the current study. In this case, the method of RFLP analysis is being used, so it fits the "Usage" category.

Another possible class is "Basis" if it were foundational, but here it's more about the method's application. "Support" isn't quite right because they're not using it to support a claim but to detail their method. "CoCoGM" or comparison classes don't apply since there's no comparison here. "Neutral" is when the citation is just mentioned without any specific argument, but here it's clearly about the method usage.

So, the most appropriate class is "Usage."

The citation refers to a method (RFLP analysis) used in the study, fitting the "Usage" class.

Usage

The passage cites Lorenz et al., 1995, as the method used for RFLP analysis in their study.
