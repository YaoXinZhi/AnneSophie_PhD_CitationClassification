Alright, I'm trying to figure out the right rhetorical class for the citation in the given scientific passage. Let me read through the text again carefully.

The passage discusses various studies on pear psyllids from different regions. It starts by mentioning that Cho & Lee (2015) reported findings from Korea and notes similarities and differences in populations. Then, it summarizes the number of species reported from each region, including a citation for Inoue et al. (2012) under Japan.

The question is asking about the citation for Inoue et al. (2012). The passage lists their work along with others from Korea and Russia, stating how many species are reported from each. It's presenting this information in a descriptive manner, not comparing it to other studies, supporting a claim, or suggesting future research. It's just stating that three species are from Japan, citing Inoue et al. as the source for that information.

Looking at the classes, "Neutral" seems to fit here because the citation is provided neutrally to state a fact without any comparison, support, or criticism. It's simply acknowledging the source of information about the number of species reported.
