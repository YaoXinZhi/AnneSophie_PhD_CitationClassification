Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for this citation. The passage is about nymphal development and mentions several studies. Let me break it down.

The first part says, "Nymphal development depends mainly on temperature and may take from 17 to 43 d at 25 째C and 14 째C, respectively (CITSEG)." So here, the citation is providing specific temperature ranges for nymphal development. This seems like the cited work is supporting the claim that temperature affects development time.

Next, it says, "The lower temperature threshold for development is about 10 째C (CITSEG), whereas a temperature of 32 째C, with low relative humidity, is particularly deleterious for all instars." Again, the citation is backing up the statement about the lower threshold.

Lastly, it mentions, "The first instar lasts the longest, probably because of the long time needed for the crawlers to settle and establish themselves." This explanation isn't citing anything, so the focus is on the previous citations.

Looking at the classes, Support is when the citation is used to confirm or reinforce a claim. Here, the cited work by Catling (1973) is directly providing data that supports the points about temperature affecting development. They're using it to back up their statements, so it fits the Support category. There's no comparison, motivation, or criticism here. It's purely backing up the claim with evidence.
