Alright, I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in the provided passage. Let me read through the passage again carefully.

The passage describes a method for collecting psyllids using a beat-tray method. It mentions that the psyllids were collected in glass tubes using a mouth aspirator and brought to the lab for analysis. Then, it cites Tedeschi et al. 2002 with the placeholder (CITSEG). Later, another citation mentions Ossiannilsson 1992 regarding the identification of species.

So, the task is to determine the rhetorical role of Tedeschi et al. 2002 in this context.

Looking at the options, the classes are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, Weakness.

In this case, the citation is referring to a method usedâ€”specifically, the method of collecting psyllids using a mouth aspirator. The authors are stating that they used a method described by Tedeschi et al., which means they are directly referencing a tool or procedure from that source.

So, the correct class would be "Usage" because they're using a method from the cited work. It's not about supporting a claim, comparing results, or anything else; it's about using the method described in the cited paper.
