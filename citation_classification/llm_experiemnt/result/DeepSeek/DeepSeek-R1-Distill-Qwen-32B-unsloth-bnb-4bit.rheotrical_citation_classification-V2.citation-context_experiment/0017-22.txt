Alright, I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation (CITSEG) in the given passage. Let's go through the passage step by step.

The passage discusses the mouthpart morphology of C. chinensis, comparing its structure to other sternorrhynchan species. The cited works are listed after the statement comparing the mouthparts. The use of "generally similar" and "very similar to" indicates that the citations are being used to show similarities with the current study.

Looking at the rhetorical classes, "Similar" is when the citation points out a similarity regarding results, patterns, etc. Since the cited works are mentioned to show that the mouthpart structure is similar to others, this fits the "Similar" class perfectly.
