Alright, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in the given passage. Let's break it down.

First, the passage says: "P. pyri' and 'Ca. "P. prunorum') of the 16SrX group type=""bibr"" target=""#b10"">[11]</ref>, changed important morphological and physiological parameters of their respective host plants, all Rosaceae" (CITSEG). We measured various parameters such as leaf morphology, plant vascular morphology, and callose deposition..."

So, the citation (CITSEG) refers to a previous study where certain phytoplasmas influenced their host plants' parameters. The current study then goes on to say that they measured similar parameters in healthy and infected plants.

Looking at the classes, I'm thinking about "Similar" because the current study is pointing out that they're measuring the same kinds of parameters as the cited work. They're not necessarily comparing results or methods, just noting that they're looking at the same types of things. So it's pointing out a similarity in the kind of variables measured, not in the results or methods themselves.

I don't think it's "Support" because theyâ€™re not necessarily aligning their findings with the cited work; they're just stating that they're measuring similar things. It's more about the approach or the aspects being measured rather than the results. So "Similar" seems to fit here because they're highlighting that their study is looking at the same parameters as the cited work.
