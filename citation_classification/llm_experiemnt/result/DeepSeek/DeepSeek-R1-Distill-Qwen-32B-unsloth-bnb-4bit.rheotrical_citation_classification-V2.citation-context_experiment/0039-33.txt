Alright, I need to classify the citation (CITSEG) in the given text into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. The text mentions that the universal phytoplasma primers P1/P7 were used, citing Schneider et al., 1995. Looking at the classes, "Usage" refers to when a citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, etc., directly used in the current study. Since the authors are using the primers from the cited work in their PCR method, this fits the Usage category. The mention of using the primers directly indicates that the method described in the cited paper is being utilized here. No other classes like Support or Comparison seem to apply because it's not about confirming results or comparing methods. So, the correct label is Usage.
