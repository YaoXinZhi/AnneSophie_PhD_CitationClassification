Alright, let's try to figure out the rhetorical class for the given citation. The passage mentions a study that compared the detection methods using PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detectingphytoplasma in planthoppers. 

First, I look at the context where (CITSEG) is cited. The sentence says, "Comparing the detection of grapevine yellows phytoplasma in planthoppers, only 66% of the PCR positives were also positive by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay" (CITSEG). 

I notice that the word "comparing" is used here, which immediately makes me think about the classes related to comparison. The options are CoCoGM, CoCoRes, and CoCoXY. 

CoCoGM is for comparing goals or methods, CoCoRes is about comparing results, and CoCoXY is for comparing explanations or claims between two studies. In this case, the citation is comparing two detection methods, PCR and ELISA, which are two different methods used for the same purpose. 

The sentence is comparing the effectiveness of these methods, specifically looking at the percentage of positives that overlap. This is a direct comparison of results between the two methods, which falls under comparing results. 

Therefore, the appropriate class here is CoCoRes because the citation is used to compare the results of two detection methods, showing that only 66% of the PCR positives were also positive via ELISA. This indicates a comparison of findings between the two methods.
