Alright, let's try to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in this passage. The passage is about the nymphal instars and adults of a species. The sentence with the citation is: "The average lengths of the first to fifth instar are 0.345 mm, 0.50 mm, 0.72 mm, 1.025 mm, and 1.52 mm, respectively" (CITSEG). 

Hmm, so the citation is providing specific measurements. The author is stating these exact numbers as evidence, which suggests they're supporting their own claims with existing data. The other class I might consider is 'Support' because they're using the cited work to back up their information. There's no comparison here, just a statement of facts that align with their findings. The context doesn't indicate any motivation or future direction either. So, I think the correct class is 'Support'.

The citation provides specific data points used to support the details about the instar lengths, thus it serves to confirm the authors' claims.
