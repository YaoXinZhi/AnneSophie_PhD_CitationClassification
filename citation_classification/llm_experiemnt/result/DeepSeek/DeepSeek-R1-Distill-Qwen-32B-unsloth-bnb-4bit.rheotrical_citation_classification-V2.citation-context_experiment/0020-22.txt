Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in the given passage. The passage is about symptom severity in pear decline with whitefly transmission (PDTW). It mentions that the symptoms resemble those caused by phytoplasma elsewhere, citing Liu et al., 2007a. 

Looking at the list of classes, I need to see which one fits best. The sentence is pointing out a similarity between the symptoms observed in this study and those caused by phytoplasma in other studies. The citation is used to support that similarity. So the rhetorical class here is about similarity.

I'm considering the "Similar" class because the sentence states that their findings are similar to previous studies. It's not comparing methods or results in a conflicting way, just pointing out that the symptoms are alike. Therefore, the correct label should be Similar.
