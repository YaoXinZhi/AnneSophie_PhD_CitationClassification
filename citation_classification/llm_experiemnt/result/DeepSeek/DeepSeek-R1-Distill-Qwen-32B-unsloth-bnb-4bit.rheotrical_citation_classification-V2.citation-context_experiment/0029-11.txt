Alright, let's try to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in this passage. The text is about pear decline and its effects on trees. The first part mentions symptoms of the disease, citing EPPO 2019. Then it talks about the spread in Austria, citing Steffek et al. 2011. 

Looking at the example, "In Austria, pear decline is widespread <ref> (Steffek et al. 2011)", the purpose seems to be presenting a fact. It's stating that pear decline is widespread in Austria, supported by the citation. The cited work is being used to confirm or reinforce the statement made by the authors. There's no comparison or suggestion of future research here, just a supportive reference.

So, the rhetorical class should be "Support".
