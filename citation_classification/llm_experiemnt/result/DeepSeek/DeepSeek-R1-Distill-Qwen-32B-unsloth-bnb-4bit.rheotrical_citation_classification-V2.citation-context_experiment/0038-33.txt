Alright, I need to determine the most appropriate rhetorical class for each citation in the given text. Let me go through each citation and decide which class it fits into based on the context.

1. First, in the sentence: "They are also present in other hemipteran insects <ref type=""bibr"" target=""#b14"">(Forbes, 1969;</ref><ref type=""bibr"" target=""#b40"">Ullman and McLean, 1986;</ref><ref type=""bibr"" target=""#b48"">Zhao et al., 2010;</ref><ref type=""bibr"" target=""#b22"">Garzo et al., 2012)</ref>." The citations here are listing previous studies that also found these structures in other insects. This is supporting the claim that these features are present elsewhere, so I think this is "Support".

2. Next, "The number of protrusions varies among different species, which may be related to the hardness of the leaves of the host plant <ref type=""bibr"" target=""#b16"">(Forbes, 1977;</ref><ref type=""bibr"" target=""#b36"">Rosell et al., 1995;</ref><ref type=""bibr"" target=""#b48"">Zhao et al., 2010;</ref><ref type=""bibr"" target=""#b22"">Garzo et al., 2012)</ref>." Again, these citations back up the idea that the number varies based on host plant hardness, so "Support".

3. The sentence mentioning <ref type=""bibr"" target=""#b22"">Garzo et al. (2012)</ref> states that they observed the same number, which supports the current observation, so "Support".

4. "Pollard (1970)</ref> found 8 teeth in adults (7 teeth in nymphs) on the mandibles of C. mali." This is providing additional data, which supports the current findings by contrasting or comparing, but it's also supporting the point by showing variability. I'm a bit confused hereâ€”could it be "CoCoGM" (comparison of methods) or "Support"? Since it's giving more evidence, I think "Support".

5. The citation to Cobben, 1978 and Leopold et al., 2003 explains the function of the stylets, which supports the explanation given, so "Support".

6. "Forbes, 1977;</ref><ref type=""bibr"" target=""#b12"">Cobben, 1978;</ref><ref type=""bibr"" target=""#b20"">Freeman et al., 2000;</ref><ref type=""bibr"" target=""#b22"">Garzo et al., 2012)</ref>" are cited to show similarity in structure to other insects, which is pointing out a similarity, so "Similar".

7. Finally, "Forbes, 1977)</ref>" is cited to support the explanation of how the stylets work, so "Support".

I think each of these citations is providing support or indicating similarity, so the classes are mostly "Support" and one "Similar".

The citations in the text are used to support the current findings and to indicate similarities with other studies. Based on the analysis, the most appropriate rhetorical classes are:

1. Support
2. Support
3. Support
4. Support
5. Support
6. Similar
7. Support
