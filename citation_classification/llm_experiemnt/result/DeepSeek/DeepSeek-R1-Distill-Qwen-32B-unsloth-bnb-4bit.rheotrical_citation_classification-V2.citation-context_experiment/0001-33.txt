Okay, I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for this citation in the given passage. The text is about B. nigricornis as a potential vector for CaLsol between carrot and potato crops. Let's look at where the citation is used. 

The passage mentions several studies that demonstrate economic losses due to the spread of the pathogen. The citations include authors like Liefting et al. 2009, Munyaneza 2010, etc. The context here is explaining why this study is necessaryâ€”because of the significant economic impact. 

The citation is being used to justify the need for the current research. It's pointing out that there's an issue (economic losses) and that their work is necessary to address it. So, it's not supporting a claim, but rather motivating why they're conducting the study.

Looking at the classes, 'Motivation' fits because the citation identifies a gap or need. 'Support' is when confirming a claim, but here it's about justifying the study's purpose.

Motivation

The citation is used to justify the necessity of the current research by highlighting the economic losses caused by the pathogen spread, thereby identifying a need for their study.
