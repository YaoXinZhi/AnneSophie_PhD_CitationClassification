Alright, I need to classify the citation in the given passage into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. Let's read through the passage carefully.

The passage is part of a scientific article discussing the resistance of Selfrooted Old Home trees to pear decline. It mentions several studies:

1. Griggs and Harmann (1960) and Jensen and Erwin (1963) who also studied these trees and their resistance.
2. Blodgett et al. (CITSEG) noted that the frequency and severity of the symptoms didn't vary with scion varieties or the origin of budwood.
3. Westwood et al. (1963) found that Bartlett was most susceptible, Anjou intermediate, and Comice least susceptible.

The task is to determine the rhetorical class for the citation marked as (CITSEG), which is Blodgett et al.

Looking at the surrounding context, Blodgett's study provided findings that the frequency and severity of symptoms didn't vary with certain factors. The authors are using this citation to support or confirm their own observations. They are presenting Blodgett's results as evidence that aligns with their own findings, reinforcing the argument about the consistent resistance of the trees.

Now, looking at the predefined classes:

- **Support**: Used when the citation supports, confirms, or reinforces a claim made by the authors. This seems to fit because Blodgett's findings back up the current study's observations.
- **Comparison of Results (CoCoRes)**: When comparing results between studies, but here they're not directly comparing but using Blodgett's findings as support.
- **Basis**: If it's foundational, but it's more about supporting rather than being the foundation.
- **Similar**: If pointing out a similarity, but the context is more about supporting.
- **Neutral**: Doesn't seem to be the case here as the citation is used to support a point.
- **Usage**: If the method or tool is used, not applicable here.
- **Weakness**: Not criticizing the cited work.
- **Comparison of Methods/Goals (CoCoGM)**: Not comparing methods or goals.
- **Motivation**: Not why the research is being done.
- **Future**: Not suggesting future directions.

Therefore, the most appropriate class is **Support**, as the citation is used to corroborate the authors' findings.
