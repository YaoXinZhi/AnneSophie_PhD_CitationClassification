Okay, so I need to classify the citation in the given scientific passage into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. The text is about hemipterans and their mouthparts, discussing various studies on their ultrastructural morphology. The citation in question is (Brozek et al., 2006) and others, listed as part of the references. 

Looking at the passage, it says that there's abundant information based on microscopy studies, and then cites several works, including Brozek et al. The context mentions that these studies have concentrated on different groups like Fulgoroidea and others. The way the citation is used here seems to be in a descriptive manner, listing existing studies without explicitly supporting, comparing, or critiquing them. 

So, the function of the citation here is to provide background information on previous research, without aligning with the current study's findings or comparing them. It's just stating that such information exists from these studies. Therefore, the most appropriate class would be "Neutral."
