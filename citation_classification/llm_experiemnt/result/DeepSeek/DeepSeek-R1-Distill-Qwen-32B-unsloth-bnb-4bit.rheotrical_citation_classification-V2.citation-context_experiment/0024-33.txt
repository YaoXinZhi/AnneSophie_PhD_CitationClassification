Alright, let's try to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in the passage. The citation is (CITSEG) referring to "fPD/r0 1" and "AP3/AP5" in the context of the study. 

First, the passage explains that for DNA analysis, two pairs of ribosomal primers were used. One pair is cited as (CITSEG) and the other as (Firrao et al., 1994). The sentence structure here is about which primers were used. 

Looking at the options, Support is when a citation supports a claim or finding. Here, the citation is just stating the primers used without necessarily supporting a result. Usage is for when a method or tool is referenced from another work, which seems to fit because they're using specific primers developed elsewhere.

Other classes like Basis or CoCoGM don't apply here since it's not establishing a foundation or comparing methods. It's purely about using a specific tool from another study, so Usage makes the most sense.
