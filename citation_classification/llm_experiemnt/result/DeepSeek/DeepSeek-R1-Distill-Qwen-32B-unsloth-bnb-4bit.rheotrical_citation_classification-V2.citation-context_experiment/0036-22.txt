Okay, I need to classify the citation in the given scientific article passage into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. Let me read through the passage carefully.

The passage describes how different plants were inoculated with phytoplasma. It mentions that apple trees were infected with a virulent accession in 2017, citing the reference [78], and pear trees were infected with 'Ca. P. pyri' in 2012, citing another reference [79].

Looking at the context, the citation [78] is mentioned when providing details about how apple trees were infected. The sentence is explaining the methodology used in the study, specifically the infection method. 

I need to determine what rhetorical class this falls into. The classes are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, Weakness.

In this case, the citation is referring to a methodâ€”the infection method used for apple trees. The passage is describing the experimental setup and methods, which suggests that the cited work provided the method or procedure used in the current study.

The Usage class is defined as when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup from the cited work that is directly used in the current study. That fits here because the authors are using a previous method described in [78] to infect their apple trees.

So, the most appropriate class is Usage because the citation is about the method used in the study.
