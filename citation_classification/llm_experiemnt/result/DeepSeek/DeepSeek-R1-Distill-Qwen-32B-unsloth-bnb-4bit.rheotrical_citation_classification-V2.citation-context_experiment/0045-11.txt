Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for this citation in the given text. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the passage says that after some hybridization tests, five different RFLP patterns were observed, and two of them were represented by specific strains, AT and AP15 R. The citation (CITSEG) refers to Kison et al., 1994, which describes these strains as having five different RFLP patterns. Then the text mentions that these two genotypes correspond to other subtypes from another study.

So, the context here is comparing the cited work's results with the current findings. The current study observed five patterns and identified two specific ones. The citation points out that in Kison's work, the same strains also resulted in five patterns. This is directly comparing the results of the cited study with the present research.

The task is to assign one of the predefined classes. Looking at the options, "CoCoRes" is for when the citation is used to compare or contrast results. Since the passage is showing that both studies found five RFLP patterns with the same strains, it's a comparison of results. Other classes like "Support" might seem close, but the key here is the comparison aspect, not just supporting the claim.

The citation is used to compare the results of the cited work with the current study, specifically the observation of five RFLP patterns. This fits the "CoCoRes" category as it compares results.
