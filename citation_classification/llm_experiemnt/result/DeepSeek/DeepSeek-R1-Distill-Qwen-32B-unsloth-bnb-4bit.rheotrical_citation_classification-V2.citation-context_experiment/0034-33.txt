Alright, let's try to figure out the rhetorical class for this citation. The passage mentions several studies by different authors, like Danet et al. 2011, Kison and Seem√ºller 2001, and Dermastia et al. 2018. The main sentence says that the current study contributed 22 German isolates to the MLST analysis of (CITSEG). So, the (CITSEG) is being cited as the one whose analysis the current study is contributing to. This means the cited work provided a method or framework that the authors are using in their own research. Looking at the classes, "Usage" fits because it refers to the use of a method or dataset from the cited work. They're directly using the MLST analysis setup from the cited work, so it's about usage, not supporting a claim or comparing results.
