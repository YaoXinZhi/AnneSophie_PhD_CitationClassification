Okay, so I have to determine the rhetorical class for the citation (CITSEG) in the given passage. Let me first try to understand the context. 

The passage talks about how Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus infects Citrus trees and induces the SA-pathway, leading to increased methyl salicylate emission. Then, it mentions that auxins like IAA and IBA induce the recovery of periwinkle plants from infections. The citation is attached to this last statement: "Auxins (IAA and IBA) were shown to induce the recovery of periwinkle plants from 'Ca. P. pruni' and 'Ca. P. asteris' infections (CITSEG), illustrating the importance of IAA in plant-pathogen interactions."

Looking at the predefined classes, I need to see which one fits best. The sentence uses the citation to back up the claim that auxins help in recovery, so it's supporting that statement. That sounds like the 'Support' class because the cited work is presented as evidence that strengthens the authors' argument about IAA's role in plant-pathogen interactions.

Wait, the passage says "were shown to induce the recovery," which is a result from a previous study, and the authors are using this to support their own point about IAA's importance. So yes, it's clearly supporting the claim.

The citation supports the claim by providing evidence from a previous study, so the appropriate class is:

Support

**Answer:** Support
