Okay, I need to classify the citation in the given passage into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. Let me first read through the passage and the example closely.

The passage states: "Besides the direct and local defence mechanisms, an activation and systemic distribution of signalling compounds such as phytohormones via the SEs, may be induced by phytoplasmas and may have an impact on the plant's defence. Moreover, typical symptoms, such as development of witches' brooms, smaller fruits, reduced leaf and vascular morphology of diseased apple trees, can be explained with an infection-induced imbalance of phytohormones (CITSEG). In apple and peach trees, SA and JA-Ile levels significantly increased in infected trees, indicating the involvement of defence pathways to phytoplasma colonization."

The (CITSEG) citation is part of a sentence that explains typical symptoms in apple trees as being due to an imbalance of phytohormones. The next sentence provides results from their own study showing increased SA and JA-Ile levels.

Looking at the rhetorical classes, the one that stands out is Support. The citation is used to back up the explanation that phytohormone imbalance leads to those symptoms, and then the authors' results further support that. So the citation is cited as prior work that supports their findings, reinforcing their own argument.

I don't think it's a Comparison of Results or Goals because they are not directly contrasting or comparing their work with the cited one. It's more about presenting their own results after citing an explanation from another study. It's notneutral because it's used to support their point, not just describe something without taking a stance.

So the correct class should be Support.
