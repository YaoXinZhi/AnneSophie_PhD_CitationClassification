Okay, I need to determine the rhetorical class for the citation in the given text. The passage is about Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum, an intracellular bacterium. The citation (CITSEG) is from two sources: Haapalainen 2014 and Perilla-Henao & Casteel 2016. The text mentions that this bacterium infects and replicates in plants and psyllid vectors.

Looking at the predefined classes, I need to see which one fits best. The sentence is stating a fact about the bacterium, citing previous work that established this information. It's supporting the current paper's claim about where the bacterium infects and replicates. 

So, this seems like a case where the citation is used to support the current findings. The authors are relying on prior research to back up their statement. Therefore, the rhetorical class should be "Support".
