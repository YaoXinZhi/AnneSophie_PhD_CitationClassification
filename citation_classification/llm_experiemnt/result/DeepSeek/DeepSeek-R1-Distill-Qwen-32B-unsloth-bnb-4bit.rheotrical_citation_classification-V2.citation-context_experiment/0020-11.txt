Alright, so I need to classify the citation in the provided passage into the correct rhetorical class. Let me carefully analyze the context and figure out which class fits best.

First, looking at the passage:

"The symptoms associated with PDTW resemble those of pear declines caused by phytoplasma elsewhere (Liu et al., 2007a). Since phytoplasmas are non-culturable, PCR amplification of ribosomal RNA genes and the 16S-23S rDNA intergenic spacer region (ISR) have become the conventional means of detecting and identifying them (Bosco et al., 2002; Davies et al., 1995; Seemüller et al., 1998). Sequences of 16S rDNA have been used to classify various phytoplasmas into groups of phylogenetic systems (Lee et al., 2007)."

The citations in question are (Bosco et al., 2002; Davies et al., 1995; Seemüller et al., 1998). The sentence structure here is explaining that PCR amplification methods are conventional for detecting phytoplasmas, and these methods are cited. So the authors are referring to studies that established or used these methods.

The key here is that the authors are stating that PCR methods are the conventional way, citing three different works. The purpose is to show that this method is standard because multiple studies have used it. They're not comparing their results with these studies, nor are they supporting their own findings with these citations. Instead, they're simply stating that these methods are conventional because these studies used them. So the citations are being used to establish or show that the methods are conventional, which is a way of using other works to support their methodological approach without necessarily aligning with their own results or findings.

Looking at the rhetorical classes:

- **Support**: This would be if they are using these studies to back up their own findings, but here they are just stating a fact about the conventional methods.
- **Usage**: This refers to citing a method, tool, etc., that is directly used in the current study. However, the current study doesn't explicitly say they used these methods; it just states that these methods are conventional.
- **Neutral**: This is when the citation is descriptive without any argumentative function. Here, the citations are being used to explain that PCR is conventional because these studies used it, which is a way of justifying the method without necessarily using it themselves.

Wait, but Usage requires that the cited work's method, tool, etc., is directly used in the current study. Since the passage doesn't state that they used these methods, just that they are conventional because of these studies, it's more about justification rather than direct usage.

So perhaps it's **Support**: they are using these studies to support the claim that PCR is conventional. Alternatively, it's **Neutral** because they’re citing these studies to provide context about the methods without supporting their own findings.

Wait, but in the example for Support, they say it's used to support or confirm a claim. Here, the claim is that PCR is conventional, and they cite three studies that did PCR. So they're using these citations to support the claim that PCR is the conventional method, thus it's a **Support**.

Wait no, let me think again. Usage is about using a method, tool, etc., from the cited work in the current study. Here, the current study is explaining that PCR is the standard method because these studies used it. So it's more about stating the convention, not using the method themselves. So they are using these studies to support their statement that PCR is conventional.

So the rhetorical function here is to support the assertion that PCR is conventional by citing prior work. Hence, the correct class is **Support**.

Wait no, on closer look, the authors are saying that PCR amplification is conventional because these studies used it. They are not using these studies to support their own results; rather, they are just stating a fact about the methods. So it might be **Neutral** because they're just citing these studies to provide context without supporting their own claims or results.

Hmm, this is a bit tricky. The line between Support and Neutral can sometimes be fine. Let me check the example for Support: "All subscales were consistent with previous research, particularly that of (CITSEG) also using a U.S. sample." That's clearly using the citation to support their own findings. In our case, they're not supporting their findings, just explaining that PCR is conventional because these studies used it. So perhaps it's **Neutral** because it's a descriptive use without providing support for their own results.

Alternatively, it could be **Usage** if they are referring to methods used by others. But according to the definition, Usage is when the cited work refers to a method, tool, etc., that is directly used by the current study. Here, the current study isn't stating that they used these methods, just that they are conventional.

Wait, the sentence says "have become the conventional means of detecting and identifying them (CITSEG)." So the citations are directly referring to these studies using PCR as a method. Therefore, the authors are citing these works as examples of how PCR is conventionally used. This is using the prior work as evidence that PCR is conventional, which would be **Support**.

Yes, I think that's correct. They're using these studies to support their statement that PCR is the conventional method, thus classifying it under **Support**.
