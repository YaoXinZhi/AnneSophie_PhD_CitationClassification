Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation marked as (CITSEG) in this passage. Let's break it down step by step. 

The passage describes how RFLP analysis was carried out, and it references Lorenz et al., 1995. The sentence says, "RFLP analysis was carried out as described previously" and cites this source. 

Looking at the predefined classes, I need to see which one fits best. The class Usage is when a citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup used in the current study. In this case, the method of RFLP analysis is being used, and the citation is pointing directly to the source where this method was described before. 

So, since the authors are using a previously described method from Lorenz et al., this would fall under the Usage category. They're not comparing their results, supporting a claim, or anything elseâ€”just stating that they used a specific method from another study.
