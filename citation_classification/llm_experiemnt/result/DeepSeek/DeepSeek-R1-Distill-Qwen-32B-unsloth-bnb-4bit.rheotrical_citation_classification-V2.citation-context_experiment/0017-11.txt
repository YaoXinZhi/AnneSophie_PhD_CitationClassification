Alright, let's break this down. The user provided a detailed prompt about classifying citations in a scientific article into specific rhetorical classes. My task is to determine the correct class for a given passage.

Looking at the passage, it's talking about the mouthpart morphology of C. chinensis and comparing it to other species. The citations are from studies by Pollard, Tavella and Arzone, Boyd, Wiesenborn, Rani and Madhavendra, and Garzo et al. The text says the mouthparts are "generally similar" and "also very similar" to those of other species. 

I need to match this with the predefined classes. The Similar class is used when a citation points out a similarity in results, patterns, or observations. This passage is definitely highlighting similarities, so it fits the Similar category. 

I don't think it's about support or weakness because the citations aren't being used to back up claims or criticize previous work. The comparison isn't between different studies for the sake of contrasting goals or results either, which rules out CoCoGM or CoCoRes. It's a straightforward similarity statement, so Similar is the right choice.
