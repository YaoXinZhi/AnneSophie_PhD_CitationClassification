Okay, I need to classify the rhetorical class for the citation (CITSEG) in the given passage. Let's read through the passage carefully.

The text is discussing the infection rates of C. pruni across different regions. It mentions that in France, Germany, and Bulgaria, the infection rates are low (1-3%), citing Yvon et al. 2004, Jarausch et al. 2007a, b, and Th√©baud et al. 2008. Then it contrasts this with Italy and Austria, where infection rates are higher than 10%, citing Carraro et al. 2004 and Maier et al. 2013. 

The section in question is: "whereas from Italy <ref ...> and Austria <ref ...> rates of more than 10% were reported." The citation in question here is (CITSEG), which points to Carraro et al. 2004 and Maier et al. 2013. 

Looking at the example for CoCoRes: when the citation is used to compare or contrast results. In the passage, the authors are comparing the low infection rates in some regions with higher rates in others. They are highlighting a contrast in the findings between the cited studies. 

So, the citation is being used to directly compare the results of different studies. Therefore, the most appropriate class is CoCoRes.
