Alright, I need to determine the rhetorical class for each citation in the given passage. Let's go through each citation one by one.

First citation: <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Liefting et al. 2009;</ref> This is cited along with others to indicate that a study was needed because of economic losses. The phrasing "strongly needed because of the important economic losses" suggests that this citation is being used to justify the current research, indicating a Motivation.

Next citation: type="bibr" target="#b98">Munyaneza 2010;</ref> This is in the same context as the first, so it's also Motivation.

Then: type="bibr" target="#b99">2012;</ref> Same context, so Motivation applies.

Lastly: type="bibr" target="#b13">Bertolini et al. 2015;</ref> and type="bibr" target="#b100">Munyaneza 2015).</ref> These are part of the same group of citations explaining the motivation for the study, so Motivation as well.

So all these citations are providing the rationale for conducting the current research, which fits the Motivation class.
