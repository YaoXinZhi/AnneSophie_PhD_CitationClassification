Okay, so I need to classify the citation in this passage into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. Let me read the passage again to understand the context. The text says: "Chinese and Taiwanese Cacopsylla chinensis sequences (CITSEG) together form well-supported clusters in the NJ trees based on COI-tRNA leu -COII and 16S rDNA gene fragments." 

Looking at the structure, the citation is pointing out that the sequences from Lee et al. form clusters in the NJ trees. The function here seems to be supporting the current study's findings. The authors are showing that their results align with previous research, which is the Support class. 

I don't see any indication that they are comparing methods, results, or goals. It's more about confirming their own clusters with prior work. So, the correct label should be Support.

Support
