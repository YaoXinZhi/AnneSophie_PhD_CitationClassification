Okay, so I need to classify the rhetorical role of the citation in this given text. Let me read the passage carefully.

The text talks about HLB being the most destructive citrus disease worldwide, mentioning symptoms and susceptibility. It then cites Baldwin et al. (2010) and Bov√© and Gottwald regarding reduced fruit quantity/quality and high management costs, respectively.

Looking at the predefined classes, the citation here is supporting the claim about HLB's impact by referencing studies that have shown similar results. So, the role is to back up the statement with previous findings.

The appropriate class is therefore "Support".
