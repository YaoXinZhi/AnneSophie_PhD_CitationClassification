Okay, so I need to determine the rhetorical class for the citation in the given scientific article passage. Let's look at the passage closely. The passage describes a method for isolating DNA from leaves and phloem scrapings, mentioning a specific extraction method. Then it references "Doyle and Doyle [84]" as the basis for their extraction method. The text states that their method is based on Doyle and Doyle's work, which suggests that Doyle and Doyle's research is providing the foundation or the original method that the current study is using. 

Looking at the predefined classes, "Basis" is for when the cited work is the intellectual foundation contributing directly to the current research. In this case, the current study is using a method established by Doyle and Doyle, so the citation serves as the foundational basis for their experimental setup. There's no comparison, support, or motivation implied here; it's purely stating where their method comes from. 

Therefore, the most appropriate label is "Basis" because the citation is being used to establish the methodological foundation of the current study.
