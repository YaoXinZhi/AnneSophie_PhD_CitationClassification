Alright, let's tackle this problem. I'm supposed to classify each citation in the given scientific text into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. The text provided is a bit dense, so I'll need to carefully read through each sentence to understand the context in which each citation is used.

First, I'll list out all the citations mentioned:

1. Thébaud et al. 2009
2. Jarausch et al. 2013
3. Yvon et al. 2004
4. Jarausch et al. 2007a, b
5. Thébaud et al. 2008
6. Etropolska et al. 2015
7. Carraro et al. 2004
8. Maier et al. 2013
9. Jarausch et al. 1998
10. Ulubaş Serçe et al. 2006
11. Sabaté et al. 2015
12. Etropolska et al. 2015
13. Carraro et al. 2002

Now, looking at each citation in context:

- Thébaud et al. 2009 and Jarausch et al. 2013 are cited together in the first sentence. They support the statement about the disease being monocyclic. So, this is a Support.

- Yvon et al. 2004, Jarausch et al. 2007a, b, Thébaud et al. 2008, and Etropolska et al. 2015 provide specific infection rates, which the authors are using to support their claims. So, each here is Support.

- Carraro et al. 2004 and Maier et al. 2013 are showing higher infection rates in Italy and Austria. This is supporting the statement about varying rates, so Support.

- Jarausch et al. 1998, Ulubaş Serçe et al. 2006, Sabaté et al. 2015, and Etropolska et al. 2015 are cited as examples of surveys conducted in different regions, supporting the presence of ESFY. All Support.

- The mention of a survey between 2000 and 2006 by (CITSEG) could be any of the earlier authors, but the context is about showing presence in regions, so Support.

- Carraro et al. 2002 studied the role of wild Prunus for spread, which is a supporting study. So, Support.

Each citation is backing up the statements about infection rates, surveys, and spread mechanisms, so the appropriate class for each is Support.

The classification of the citations in the provided text is as follows, each categorized under the rhetorical class of Support, as they all provide backing evidence for the claims made regarding infection rates, surveys, and the spread of the disease.

**Answer: Support**
