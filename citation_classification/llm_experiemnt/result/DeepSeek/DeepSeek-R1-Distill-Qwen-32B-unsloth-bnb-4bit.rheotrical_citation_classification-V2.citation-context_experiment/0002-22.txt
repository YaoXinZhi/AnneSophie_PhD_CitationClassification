Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class of the citation (CITSEG) in the given passage. The classes are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, Weakness. 

Looking at the text, the passage discusses interspecific comparisons of various agents and their 16S rDNA sequence similarities. It mentions that the sequence similarity values confirm the results of previous work, which is cited as (CITSEG). The key words here are "confirm" and "previous work," which suggest that the cited work is being used to back up the findings presented in the current study.

So, the citation is supporting the claim that the sequence similarities confirm earlier findings. That makes the rhetorical class Support, because it's used to reinforce the authors' results with prior research.

Support

The passage uses the citation to support the claim by confirming previous findings with their results, indicating the cited work provides evidence aligning with the current study's conclusions.

**Answer:** Support
