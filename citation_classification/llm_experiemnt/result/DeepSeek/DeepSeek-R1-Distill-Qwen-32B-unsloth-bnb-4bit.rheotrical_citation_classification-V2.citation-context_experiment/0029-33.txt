Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class of the citation (CITSEG) in the given passage. Let me start by understanding the context and the predefined classes.

First, the passage talks about pear decline symptoms and mentions a necrotic phloem ring. The citation (CITSEG) is right after this description. The sentence is: "A necrotic phloem ring at the graft union may develop (CITSEG)."

Looking at the predefined classes, I need to determine which one fits this context. Let's go through each one.

- **Basis**: The cited work is the foundation. Here, it's just supporting a symptom, not the foundation.
- **CoCoGM/CoCoRes/CoCoXY**: These are for comparisons. The passage isn't comparing this study with others.
- **Future**: Suggesting future research; no, the citation is just supporting a fact.
- **Motivation**: Justifying why the research is done; the passage isn't explaining why they're studying this.
- **Neutral**: Descriptive without supporting or comparing. Hmm, the citation is just stating a fact.
- **Similar**: Pointing out similarity with other studies; not here.
- **Support**: Cited to support a claim; the sentence is stating a symptom and citing a source as evidence.
- **Usage**: Using a method or tool; no, it's about a symptom, not a method.

So the citation is supporting the statement that a necrotic phloem ring develops. That aligns with the "Support" class because it's presenting evidence for the claim made.
