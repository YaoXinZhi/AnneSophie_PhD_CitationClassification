Alright, I'm trying to figure out the correct rhetorical class for the citation in the given text. The passage is talking about using the 16S rRNA gene as a molecular marker in phylogenetic studies. The sentence says, "This molecular marker has been widely used for phylogenetic and taxonomic classification of prokaryotes (CITSEG)." 

So, I need to determine why the citation is there. The author is stating that the 16S rRNA gene is a commonly used tool in their field. The citation is supporting this claim by referring to previous studies that have used this marker. 

Looking at the predefined classes, the Support class is for citations that confirm or reinforce the authors' claims. Since the citation here is showing that others have used the same method, it supports the assertion that the marker is widely used. It's not comparing methods, providing motivation, or pointing out weaknesses; it's purely backing up the statement with prior research. 

I think Support is the right label because the citation is used to back up the claim about the marker's usage.

The citation is used to support the claim by referencing prior studies that have utilized the 16S rRNA gene. 

**Answer:** Support
