Okay, I need to determine the rhetorical class for the citation marked as (CITSEG) in the provided text. Let me start by reading through the passage carefully.

The passage talks about pear psylla transmitting a virus causing PD disease, referencing Jensen et al. (1964). It then mentions more recent reports, including a citation to France and Italy (CITSEG), and studies in England by Davies et al. (1992 and 1998). The (CITSEG) is specifically referring to Lemoine (1991), which reported on transmission in France and Italy.

Looking at the context around (CITSEG), the sentence is discussing multiple studies showing transmission in different regions. The (CITSEG) is one of these, indicating that Lemoine's work is cited as an example of transmission in France and Italy. The passage is compiling similar studies to show that transmission has been observed in multiple locations.

Now, referring to the rhetorical classes, I need to find the most appropriate label. The key classes here might be "Similar" or "Support". "Support" is used when the citation reinforces the authors' claims, while "Similar" points out a similarity with the citing paper.

In this case, the use of (CITSEG) is to present another study that shows transmission, reinforcing that the phenomenon is consistent across different regions. So it's supporting the claim about the transmission being observed in various places. Therefore, the appropriate class is "Support".
