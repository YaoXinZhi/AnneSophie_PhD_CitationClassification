Okay, I need to determine the rhetorical class for the citation (CITSEG) in the given text. Let me read through the text carefully.

The text mentions that "Bactericera cockerelli was associated with zebra chip disease in potato in 2007 (CITSEG)" and later with CaLsol in 2009. The citation here is referring to a specific event where the association was first noted. 

Looking at the context around (CITSEG), it's providing evidence that supports the timeline of when Bactericera cockerelli was linked to the disease. The authors are reinforcing their claim by citing when the association was established. 

This seems to align with the "Support" class because the citation is used to back up the authors' statement about the association timeline, acting as evidence to strengthen their argument.

The citation is used to support the assertion about the association timeline, reinforcing the claim with evidence.

Support

**Answer:** Support
