Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in the given passage. First, I need to understand the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the results are supported by data from (CITSEG). Here, the authors are presenting their findings about infection rates and are pointing out that this is supported by data from other studies. 

Looking back at the classes, I see "Support" is when a citation is used to back up a claim or finding. The authors are saying their data is in line with previous studies, which is a way of reinforcing their results. It doesn't seem to be a comparison of methods or results directly; more so, it's about confirming their findings with other research.

Another class to consider is "Similar," but that's more about pointing out similarities rather than supporting a claim. In this case, the authors are explicitly stating that their findings are supported by other data, which fits the "Support" category better.

So, the citation is used to support their results, making "Support" the most appropriate label.
