Alright, so I need to figure out which rhetorical class the citation (CITSEG) falls into in the given passage. Let me read through the passage carefully to understand the context and how the citation is used.

The passage is about an experiment involving different fruit trees and their infections with phytoplasmas. Hereâ€™s the relevant part: "Apple trees were infected with a virulent accession (3/6, n = 13) in 2017" (CITSEG) [ref]. The citation is mentioned right after the statement about infecting apple trees with a specific phytoplasma.

Looking at the rhetorical classes, I need to determine what role the citation plays here. The options are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, Weakness.

The citation is providing evidence about the infection method used in the study. The sentence is simply stating that apple trees were infected in a particular way in 2017, and the citation supports that specific detail. It's not comparing methods or results, nor is it pointing out a weakness. It's just referencing where this information comes from.

This seems like the Usage class because the citation is referring to a method or experimental setup used in the current study. The researchers are using a previous study's method to infect apple trees, so they cite it as the source of that method.

Wait, no. Actually, the Usage class is when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or setup used in the current study. In this case, the study is citing a previous work to back up their method of infecting apple trees. So yes, Usage makes sense here because they're using the cited work's method in their current experiment.

Alternatively, could it be Support? Because they're citing it to support a claim. However, the Support class is when the citation is used to back up a claim or result. In this case, it's more about referencing the method used, which makes me lean towards Usage.

Yes, so the citation is used to reference the method of infecting apple trees, which means it's a Usage class.
