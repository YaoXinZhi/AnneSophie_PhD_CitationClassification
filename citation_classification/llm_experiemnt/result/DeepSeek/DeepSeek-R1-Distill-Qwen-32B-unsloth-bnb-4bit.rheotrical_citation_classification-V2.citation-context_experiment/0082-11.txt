Okay, I need to analyze the passage and determine the rhetorical class of the citations. Let me read through the text carefully. 

The passage is about DNA barcoding being a fast and efficient method for species identification. It mentions that this method is commonly used for identifying quarantine and agricultural pests, citing three references. Then it adds that DNA-based methodologies are also useful for species identification in cases where females or immatures lack diagnostic morphological characters, citing another reference.

Looking at the first citation: "It is commonly used for identification of quarantine and agricultural pests (CITSEG)" Here, the authors are providing support for their statement that DNA barcoding is useful in these contexts. The references are backing up their claim with existing studies, so this is likely a 'Support' class.

The second citation: "DNA-based methodologies... (Boehme et al., 2010)" This is also used to support the point about its usefulness in cases where morphological characters are lacking. Again, it's providing evidence to back up the statement.

So both citations are used to support the claims made by the authors. There's no comparison here; it's just reinforcing their points. Therefore, the correct class for both is 'Support'.

The citations are used to support the authors' claims about the effectiveness of DNA-based methods in species identification. 

Response: Support
