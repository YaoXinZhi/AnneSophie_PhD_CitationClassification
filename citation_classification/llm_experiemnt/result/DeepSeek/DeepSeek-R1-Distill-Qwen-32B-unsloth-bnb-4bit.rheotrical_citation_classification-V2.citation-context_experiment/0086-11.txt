Okay, so I need to classify the rhetorical class of the citation (CITSEG) in the given text. Let me read through the text carefully. The passage is about insects infected with a pathogen and their role in orchards. It mentions that the infected remigrants are highly infectious, citing Th√©baud et al. 2009. 

Looking at the context, the sentence is stating that at a certain time, the individuals are highly infectious, and they reference a study showing this. The function here seems to be supporting the claim that these insects are infectious at that time. So the citation is used to back up the assertion made by the current paper.

Now, looking at the predefined classes, the Support class is for when the citation reinforces a claim made by the authors. There's another class called Usage, which is for referring to methods or tools, but this isn't the case here. The citation is providing evidence to support the claim about high infectivity.

So I think the correct class is Support.

Support
