Okay, I need to classify the citation (CITSEG) in the given passage into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. Let me read through the passage carefully first.

The passage discusses the effects of phytoplasmas on host plants. It mentions several symptoms and then quotes a citation that says, "Additionally, abnormal growth, stunting, growth of witches' brooms, reduced root size and dwarf fruits occur in phytoplasma infected plants indicating a disturbed hormone balance type=""bibr"" target=""#b24"">[25,</ref>" (CITSEG). It then goes on to talk about phytohormones and their role in defense responses, citing another work that reviews their influence on various hormones.

Looking at the context, the mention of disturbed hormone balance is followed by a discussion about how phytohormones are induced in response to stresses and their pathways. The citation is supporting the point about the disturbance in hormone balance caused by phytoplasma infections, reinforcing the idea that the infections affect hormone pathways. 

So, the cited work is providing evidence that aligns with the author's argument about how phytoplasma infections disrupt hormone balance. Therefore, the rhetorical class here is 'Support' because the citation is used to back up the claim about the effects of phytoplasma on hormones.
