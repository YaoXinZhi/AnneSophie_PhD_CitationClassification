Okay, I need to classify the citations in this text using the predefined rhetorical classes. The citations are denoted as (CITSEG). Let's look at the passage:

"However, most studies related to transmission of Ca. Liberibacter spp. by D. citri were performed with CLas. This bacterium has a persistent propagative relationship with D. citri type="bibr" target="#b65">(Inoue et al. 2009;</ref> (CITSEG) <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Orlovskis et al. 2015)</ref>."

So, the sentence is talking about the relationship between CLas and D. citri. The authors cite two studies: Inoue et al. (2009) and Orlovskis et al. (2015). The use of (CITSEG) is where both are referenced together.

Looking at the options:

The context is stating that these studies confirm the relationship, so the citations are supporting the authors' claim. They're not comparing methods or results, just supporting the assertion. So the appropriate class seems to be "Support."

Alternatively, "Usage" might be a consideration if they were using a method from the cited works, but it doesn't seem to be the case here. They are just supporting the fact about the relationship.

So, the most appropriate class is "Support."
