Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation (CITSEG) in the given text. Let me go through the passage and see where the CITSEG is placed and understand its context.

The passage is about phytoplasmas in pears and mentions several studies. It starts by talking about pear decline in Taiwan, citing Liu et al., 2007b and Yang et al., 2004. Then it talks about a study monitoring phytoplasma, citing Liu et al., 2007b again. Next, it mentions the causative agent in southern Australia, citing Schneider and Gibb, 1997, and Agrios, 2005. Then it mentions the symptoms not being of a certain type but another, with (CITSEG) right after that sentence.

Looking at the sentence: "The symptoms of phytoplasma-affected pears (Pyrus communis) in Australia are not of curling and reddening leaves [CITSEG] but of decline and dieback." The (CITSEG) here is attached to the part about the symptoms not being of a certain type. The previous sentence mentioned Agrios, 2005, but the CITSEG is a placeholder here, so I need to figure out where it's referring to.

Wait, the actual text might have placed CITSEG incorrectly. The sentence structure says that the symptoms are "not of curling and reddening leaves type="bibr" target="#b0">(Agrios, 2005)</ref> but of decline and dieback." It seems that CITSEG is replacing the actual citation (Agrios, 2005). So the sentence is saying that according to Agrios, the symptoms are not of a certain type, which is used to compare with the current study's findings.

Looking at the classes, I need to see which one fits. The sentence is comparing the symptoms described by Agrios to the current findings. Specifically, it's saying that the symptoms are not as described by Agrios but are different. This is a comparison of results or findings between two studies.

The class that deals with comparing results is CoCoRes. Let me recall the definitions. CoCoRes is for comparing or contrasting results or findings between the cited work and the citing paper. In this case, the current paper is stating that their findings on symptoms differ from those cited (Agrios, 2005), which fits the comparison of results.

Alternatively, could it be Support? No, because it's not confirming or aligning; it's contrasting. Similarly, Motivation isn't about justifying why the research is being done, but this is about showing a difference in results.

So, the correct class is CoCoRes.
