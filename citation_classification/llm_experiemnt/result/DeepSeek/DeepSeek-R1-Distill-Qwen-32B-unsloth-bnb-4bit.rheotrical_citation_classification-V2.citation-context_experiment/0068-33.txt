Alright, I need to determine the rhetorical class for the citation in the given passage. Let me read through the text carefully.

The passage discusses the number of dendritic canals in the maxilla and mandible across different species. It mentions various studies, each cited using (CITSEG) placeholders.

Looking at the structure: The author is comparing the findings of different studies. For example, "similar to those of other studied Sternorrhyncha except..." and "but this is different from the dendrite pattern of leafhoppers and planthoppers." This indicates that the author is contrasting or comparing the results of multiple cited works.

Each (CITSEG) is used to refer to another study, and the author is comparing their results with these studies. This suggests that each citation is being used to compare or contrast with another cited work, not necessarily with their own paper.

So, the appropriate class would be CoCoXY because it's used to compare or contrast two cited studies with each other, highlighting similarities or differences in their findings.

CoCoXY
