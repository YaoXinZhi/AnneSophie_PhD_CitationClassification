Okay, so I need to figure out what rhetorical class the citation (CITSEG) belongs to in the given text. Let's break it down step by step.

First, let me read the passage carefully. The text says:

"Additional apple, pear and peach plants were inoculated by grafting of two buds from trees infected with the respective phytoplasma." "Apple trees were infected with a virulent accession (3/6, n = 13) in 2017" (CITSEG) <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref>. "Pear trees were infected with 'Ca. P. pyri' (PD-W, n = 5) in 2012 (Table <ref type=""table"" target=""#tab_4"">5</ref>)."

The part with (CITSEG) is referring to the source cited as [78] and [79]. The sentence structure around the citation is describing how apple trees were infected with a virulent accession in 2017.

Now, looking at the rhetorical classes:

- **Usage**: When the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup used in the current study.
- **Support**: When the citation supports, confirms, or reinforces a claim or result.
- **Basis**: The cited work is foundational to the current research.
- **CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY**: Comparisons of goals, results, or explanations.
- **Future, Motivation, Weakness**: When citing for future directions, justifying the research, or criticizing.

In the sentence, the citation is providing specific details about how apple trees were infected in a previous study. The current study uses this information to describe their methodology or setup. It doesn't seem to be comparing methods, supporting a finding, or pointing out a weakness. Instead, it's directly referring to a method used elsewhere that is being replicated or used here.

Therefore, the citation is used as a reference for the experimental setup, which aligns with the **Usage** category.
