Okay, I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in this passage. Let's break down the text. The passage mentions that in infected P. persica plants, the IAA concentration was lower than in healthy ones, referencing (CITSEG) to illustrate the importance of IAA in plant-pathogen interactions.

First, I should understand the context. The authors are pointing out that lower IAA levels are associated with infection. They're using the cited study as evidence to support their observation. The citation is presented as backing up their findings.

Looking at the classes, 'Support' is when the citation is used to strengthen the authors' claims. Here, the cited work is showing that IAA's role is important, which matches the authors' observation.

Other classes like 'CoCoRes' involve comparing results, but here they're not contrasting; they're confirming. 'Basis' would be if the cited work was foundational, but it seems more supportive than that.

So, the most appropriate class is 'Support' because the citation is used to back up their finding about reduced IAA levels in infected plants.
