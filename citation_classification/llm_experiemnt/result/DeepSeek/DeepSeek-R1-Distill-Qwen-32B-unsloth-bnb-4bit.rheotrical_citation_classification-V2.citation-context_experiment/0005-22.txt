Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for this citation in the given text. Let me read the passage again.

The text says: "Unfortunately, reliable basal and upper developmental temperatures from which phenological models could be developed using minimum and maximum temperature thresholds have not been determined." Then it mentions that nymphal development depends on temperature and cites Catling 1973, saying it takes 17 to 43 days at specific temperatures. It also mentions the lower threshold is 10째C, again citing Catling 1973. Then comes the sentence: "whereas a temperature of 32 째C, with low relative humidity, is particularly deleterious for all instars (CITSEG)." So, the CITSEG is Catling 1973 here.

I need to determine why this citation is used. The passage is discussing the developmental temperatures of nymphs. The first part says that reliable temperatures haven't been determined, then uses Catling 1973 to provide specific data: 17-43 days, 10째C as the lower threshold, and then 32째C being deleterious.

Looking at the rhetorical classes, 'Support' is when the citation supports or confirms the authors' claims. Here, the authors are stating that without reliable temperatures, but then they cite Catling to provide specific data points that support their discussion on temperature thresholds. They're using the citation to back up their own points about the temperature effects on development. 

So, the citation is supporting the argument by providing concrete data, thus it's 'Support'.

The citation is used to support the argument by providing specific temperature data, reinforcing the authors' points about developmental thresholds.
