Okay, I need to determine the rhetorical class for the citation (CITSEG) in the given passage. Let me read through the passage carefully.

The passage begins by stating that several studies in South Africa have varying results, sometimes contradictory, with unclear durations for each life stage. It then mentions that reliable temperatures for phenological models haven't been determined. 

Next, it provides some specific data: nymphal development depends on temperature, taking 17 to 43 days at 25°C and 14°C. It cites Catling 1973 for this. Then, it says, "The lower temperature threshold for development is about 10°C" and again cites Catling 1973. However, the passage uses (CITSEG) in the sentence: "whereas a temperature of 32°C, with low relative humidity, is particularly deleterious for all instars" (CITSEG). 

Looking at the context around (CITSEG), it's talking about high temperatures being harmful. The citation here is supporting the statement about 32°C being deleterious. So the cited work is being used as evidence to back up this claim. 

The example given for the Support class is when a citation reinforces the authors' findings. Here, (CITSEG) is used to provide backing for the statement about the adverse effects of high temperatures. Therefore, the appropriate class is Support.
