Okay, I need to determine the rhetorical class for the citation (CITSEG) in the given passage. Let's look at the text.

The passage talks about the timing of major plant and insect divergences and mentions that the radiation of angiosperms was underway. It cites (CITSEG) regarding the time frame of 168-246 Ma, which aligns with Kumar et al., 2017. 

Looking at the classes, "Support" is when a citation confirms or reinforces a claim. Here, the authors reference (CITSEG) to support the timeframe they're discussing, aligning with their own findings.

I think the answer is Support.
