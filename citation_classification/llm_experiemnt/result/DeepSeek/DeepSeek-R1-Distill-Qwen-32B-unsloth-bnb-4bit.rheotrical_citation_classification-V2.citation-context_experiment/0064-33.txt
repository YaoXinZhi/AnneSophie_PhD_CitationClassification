Alright, I need to determine the rhetorical class for the citation (CITSEG) in the given passage. The passage is about pear psyllids, their impact, and taxonomy. The specific part in question is: "In the past, the presence of seasonal dimorphism, controlled by temperature and photoperiod (CITSEG), that affect adult colour, size and wing morphology in some species (fig." So, the (CITSEG) is referring to a study that discusses seasonal dimorphism in pear psyllids.

First, I'll look at the context around the citation. The sentence is explaining that seasonal dimorphism, influenced by temperature and photoperiod, affects the appearance of adult psyllids. The citation is providing evidence for this statement. So, the function of this citation is to support the claim being made by the authors.

Now, mapping this to the rhetorical classes provided:

- **Support**: Used to back up a claim with evidence. Here, the citation is backing up the explanation of seasonal dimorphism.

Other classes don't fit as well:

- It's not a **Basis** because the cited work isn't the foundation of the current research.
- Not **CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY** since there's no comparison being made.
- Not **Future** because it's not suggesting future research directions.
- Not **Motivation** as it's not explaining why the research is being done.
- Not **Neutral** because it's being used to explain a phenomenon, not just mentioning it.
- Not **Similar** because it's not pointing out a similarity between studies.
- Not **Usage** because it's not referring to a method or tool used.
- Not **Weakness** because there's no criticism of the cited work.

Therefore, the citation is supporting the explanation of seasonal dimorphism, so the appropriate class is **Support**.
