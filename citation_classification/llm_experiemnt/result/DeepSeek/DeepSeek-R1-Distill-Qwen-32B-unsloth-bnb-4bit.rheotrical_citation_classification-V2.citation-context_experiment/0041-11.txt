Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for this citation. Let me read through the passage carefully. The sentence is about pear decline symptoms and the citation is referring to Agrios, 2005. 

The text says, "The symptoms of phytoplasma-affected pears (Pyrus communis) in Australia are not of curling and reddening leaves [citation] but of decline and dieback." So the author is comparing the symptoms they observed with what's been previously reported. They're pointing out that their findings don't match the curling and reddening symptoms cited by Agrios.

Looking at the rhetorical classes, I think this might be a Support class because they're using a citation to back up their observation. But wait, the example also contradicts the cited work, showing a difference. So maybe it's a comparison. Let me check the definitions.

CoCoRes is for comparing or contrasting results. In the example, the current results differ from the cited results, so that fits. They're pointing out that their symptoms are not the same as what Agrios reported. So the function is to compare their results with the previous study.

I think the correct class here is CoCoRes because they're contrasting their findings with the cited work. The citation is used to highlight a difference, which is a comparison of results.
