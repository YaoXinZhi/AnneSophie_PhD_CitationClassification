Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation (CITSEG) in the given text. Let's read through the passage carefully.

The passage is about pear decline and mentions several studies. The sentence with the citation is: "Blodgett et al. (CITSEG) noted that the frequency and severity of pear decline symptoms did not vary with the scion varieties or with the origin of budwood." 

So, Blodgett et al. found that scion varieties and budwood origin didn't affect pear decline. In the next sentence, Westwood et al. found that Bartlett was more susceptible, Anjou intermediate, and Comice least. 

The main point is comparing different findings. Blodgett et al. say scion variety doesn't matter, while Westwood et al. say it does. The citing paper is pointing out this contradiction between the two studies. 

Looking at the classes, CoCoRes is for when the citation compares results. But here, it's comparing two cited works with each other, not with the citing paper. So CoCoXY might be the right class. Because CoCoXY is when two cited studies are compared. 

Wait, in the example for CoCoXY, a review mentions contradictory results. Similarly, here the paper is pointing out that Blodgett and Westwood have different findings. So it's using the citation to show a contrast between two studies, which fits CoCoXY.

But wait, the passage only mentions Blodgett et al. and then Westwood et al. separately. So the citation of Blodget et al. is followed by a statement that someone else found different results. Maybe the function of this specific citation (Blodget et al.) is to provide a contrasting result, so maybe the class is Support? No, because it's showing that their finding is different from another study, which supports the argument that there's a contradiction. Hmm.

Alternatively, since the passage is pointing out that Blodgett et al. found no variation, and someone else found variation, perhaps the citation is used to compare the results of two studies. So it's a comparison of explanations or claims, hence CoCoXY.

Wait, but the user mentions that the (CITSEG) is the specific citation in the text. The text has Blodget et al. (CITSEG). So that citation is pointing out that scion variety doesn't matter, but another study found it does. So the function is to show a comparison between the cited works. Therefore, the label should be CoCoXY.

The citation (CITSEG) is used to compare findings between two studies, highlighting a contradiction. The correct class is CoCoXY.

CoCoXY
