Okay, so I need to classify the citation (CITSEG) in the given text. The passage is about sampling psyllids, determining their species and seasonal stage using a method, which is cited as (CITSEG). The surrounding text says that they used a stereomicroscope according to Ossiannilsson (1992), and then cites (CITSEG). 

Looking at the rhetorical classes, I need to find the most appropriate one. The Usage class refers to when a citation is used for a method, tool, etc., directly used in the current study. Here, the citation seems to be about the method used for determining the psyllid stages, which fits Usage. It's not comparing or supporting a claim, just stating where the method came from. So, I think Usage is the right class.
