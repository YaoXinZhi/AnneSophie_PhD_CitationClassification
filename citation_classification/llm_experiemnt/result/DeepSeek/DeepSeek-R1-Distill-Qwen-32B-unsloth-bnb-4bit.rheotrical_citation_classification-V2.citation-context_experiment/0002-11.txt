Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the given citation in the passage. The text is about strain similarity and phylogenetics. The sentence says that the sequence similarity values confirm previous work (CITSEG). 

Hmm, looking at the classes, "Support" is when the citation reinforces a claim made by the authors. Here, the authors are confirming their results with prior work, so it's supporting their findings. 

Also, the other classes like "Basis" don't fit because it's not foundational but confirming. "CoCoRes" is about comparing results with the cited work, but here it's more about aligning with previous results rather than contrasting. So "Support" is the best fit.
