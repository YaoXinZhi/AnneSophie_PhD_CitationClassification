Alright, I need to classify the cited work in the given passage according to the predefined rhetorical classes. Let's see... The passage is about proposing synonymies for certain species, specifically mentioning that the dimorphism between winter and summer generations was overlooked in the past. They cite (CITSEG) in the context of discussing these synonymies.

Looking at the predefined classes, I should determine the role of this citation. The class "Support" is when the citation is used to back up a claim or finding. In this case, they're citing a previous work to support their proposed synonymies, which aligns with the "Support" class. They are referring to the cited work as evidence for their current classification decisions.
