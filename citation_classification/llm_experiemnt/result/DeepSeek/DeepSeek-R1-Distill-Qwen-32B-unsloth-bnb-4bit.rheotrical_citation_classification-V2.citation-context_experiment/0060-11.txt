Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in this passage. Let me read through the text again to understand the context. The passage says:

"In this paper, times of origin and major divergences of phytoplasmas were estimated using the 16S rRNA gene." This molecular marker has been widely used for phylogenetic and taxonomic classification of prokaryotes (CITSEG). "Our initial timetree estimate, using calibrations of deeper nodes only (Fig. <ref type=""figure"" target=""#fig_2"">1</ref>, blue arrows), suggested the divergence between the most recent common ancestor of phytoplasmas and A. palmae + A. parvum occurred ~614.55 Ma."

So, the citation (CITSEG) is referring to a source that discusses the use of the 16S rRNA gene as a molecular marker. The main paper is talking about using this marker to estimate times of origin and divergence for phytoplasmas. The sentence right before the citation mentions that this molecular marker has been widely used for phylogenetic and taxonomic classification of prokaryotes, referencing the cited work.

I need to determine which rhetorical class this falls into. The list includes classes like Usage, Basis, CoCoGM, Support, etc. Let me review each class's definition.

- Usage: When citing a method, tool, dataset, or setup used in the current study. The example uses a previous study's method.
- Support: Citing to support a claim made by the authors. The cited work is presented as evidence.
- Basis: When the cited work is foundational for the current research.
- CoCoRes: Comparing results with the cited work.

In this context, the paper is stating that the 16S rRNA gene is a widely used marker. The citation is supporting this claim by referencing that others have used it for similar purposes. So the cited work is being used to back up the assertion that this marker is effective, which seems to be the Usage class because it's about the method or tool being used. However, another angle is that the citation is supporting the claim that it's widely used, which would be Support.

Wait, the sentence structure is: "This molecular marker has been widely used (CITSEG)." So the citation is providing evidence that it's widely used, which is a claim made by the authors. So this is a case of Support, where the cited work is used as evidence to support the authors' assertion.

But sometimes, when a method is used in a study, it's classified under Usage. However, in this case, the authors are not necessarily using their own method, but stating that the marker is widely used, and citing a source that demonstrates that. So the citation is supporting the usage claim, hence Support.

Another possible class is Usage, but the way it's phrased is more about the fact that it's widely usedâ€”so supporting that assertion, not necessarily using it in their own methodology. Wait, the paper is using this marker, but the citation is about it being widely used by others. So the authors are not just using it but citing its established use. So that might be Basis because it's establishing it as a foundation for their approach.

But no, the paper is directly stating they used the marker, and the citation is just supporting that the marker is a good choice because others have used it. So perhaps Support is more accurate, as the citation is cited as evidence that the marker is reliable or commonly used.

Alternatively, maybe Basis because the choice of the molecular marker is foundational to their research. But the way it's phrased is more about the marker being widely used, with the citation as support for that fact. So I'm leaning towards Support as the classification because they're citing it to back up their claim about its widespread use, which in turn justifies their own use of it.

Wait, but perhaps the correct class here is Usage because they're referring to the method (using the 16S rRNA gene) that others have used. So the citation is indicating that the method is established, which is a form of Usage.

Hmm, I'm a bit torn between Support and Usage. Support is when the citation is used to back up a claim, while Usage is when the method is directly cited as what's used. In this case, the authors are saying that the marker is widely used, and they reference a study that has used it, so it's more about supporting the effectiveness or established use of the marker, hence Support.

Wait, looking at the example for Support: "All subscales were consistent with previous research, particularly that of (CITSEG) also using a U.S. sample; as before, participants did not distinguish between personal interests and values as reasons for disputes, nor between competence and methods."

That's similar because the authors are pointing out that their results are consistent with previous findings. In the given text, the authors are supporting their choice of the 16S rRNA gene by citing its widespread use elsewhere, which serves as evidence for its appropriateness. So yes, it's Support.

Therefore, the most appropriate class is Support.
</think>

The citation is used to support the claim that the 16S rRNA gene is a widely used molecular marker, which is a form of corroborating evidence.

**Support**
