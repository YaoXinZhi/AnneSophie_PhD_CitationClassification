Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in the given text. The text is about auxins and their role in plant-pathogen interactions. The citation is mentioned in the context of a study where auxins like IAA and IBA induced recovery in periwinkle plants infected with certain pathogens. This is used to illustrate the importance of IAA.

Looking at the options, the citation is supporting the claim about the importance of IAA. It's presented as evidence that aligns with the current paper's findings. The authors are using the cited work to back up their argument that auxins are crucial. There's no comparison or contrast, just a direct support.

So, the most appropriate class is Support.
