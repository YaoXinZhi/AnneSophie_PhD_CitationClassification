Okay, I'm trying to figure out which rhetorical class the citation (CITSEG) falls into in this context. The passage says that based on the information from the citation, pear growers became aware that pears are the main reservoir for PYLR. This awareness led to the use of effective insecticides, which reduced the incidence of PYLR over eight years. The citation is used to support the claim that pear growers changed their practices because of this awareness. It's presented as evidence that strengthens the argument about the impact of insecticides. So, the citation is supporting the authors' point about the effectiveness of the control measures. That makes it a "Support" class.
