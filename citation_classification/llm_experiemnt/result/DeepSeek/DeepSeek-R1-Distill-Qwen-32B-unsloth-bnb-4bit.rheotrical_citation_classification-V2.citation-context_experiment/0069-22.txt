Alright, I need to determine the rhetorical class for the citation (CITSEG) in the provided passage. The passage mentions several studies that have identified the rootstocks' susceptibility to Pear Decline caused by a virus. The citation is part of a list that includes Blodgett et al., 1963; Shalla et al., 1963; and Jensen et al., 1964. 

First, I'll consider what the passage is doing. It's stating that these studies have identified the issue. The context is not comparing their methods or results to the current paper, nor is it supporting a claim the authors are making. Instead, it's simply listing prior research that has established this fact. 

Looking at the predefined classes:

- **Basis**: If it were establishing the foundation, but the passage isn't presenting a new solution based on these works.
- **CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY**: These involve comparison, which isn't happening here.
- **Future**: Not discussing future directions.
- **Motivation**: Doesn't justify why the current research is being done.
- **Neutral**: The citation is used neutrally to state established results.
- **Similar**: No similarity to another study mentioned.
- **Support**: The authors aren't using it to back their own findings; they're just stating facts from others.
- **Usage**: Not a tool or method used in their study.
- **Weakness**: No criticism of prior work.

The most appropriate class here is **Neutral** because the citation is used to provide a factual statement about prior research without supporting or comparing it to the current paper's arguments or findings.

Neutral

The citation is used neutrally to state prior research findings without supporting or comparing to the current paper's claims. 

**Neutral**
