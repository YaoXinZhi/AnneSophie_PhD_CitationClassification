Alright, so I need to determine the rhetorical class for the given citation (CITSEG) in the provided passage. Let's start by reading through the passage carefully.

The passage discusses interspecific comparisons of different agents and their 16S rDNA sequences, providing specific similarity values. It then mentions that the results largely confirm the findings of previous work, citing Seemueller et al., 1994. The sentence structure here is key. 

The phrase "confirm the results of previous work" is a strong indicator. The authors are using the cited work as evidence to support their own findings. They're aligning their results with those of the referenced study, which suggests that they are using the citation to back up their conclusions.

Looking at the predefined classes, the "Support" class is used when a citation supports, confirms, or reinforces a claim or result. This fits because the authors are showing that their results agree with the cited work, thereby strengthening their argument.

Other classes like "CoCoRes" involve comparing results between studies, but here it's more about aligning with a previous study rather than contrasting. "Basis" would be if the cited work was foundational, but in this case, it's more about confirmation. "Usage" is about methods or tools, which isn't applicable here. So, "Support" is the most appropriate label.
