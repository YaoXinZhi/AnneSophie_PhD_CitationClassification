Okay, I need to classify the citations in the given passage into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. Let's look at each citation and determine their roles in the context.

First, the passage starts with "(Doi et al., 1967)" cited as the first observation of phytoplasmas. This is introducing prior work that established the initial discovery, so this is a Basis because it's the foundation of the current discussion.

Next is "(Namba et al., 1993)" mentioned for developing molecular techniques that revealed the diversity. This shows the progression from microscopy to molecular methods, so it's also a Basis since it's building on the prior foundation.

Then, the passage refers to methods based on phylogenetic analysis, citing three studies: (Lee et al., 2010), (Martini et al., 2007), and (Zhao et al.,2009). These are used to explain the current classification method. This seems to be providing support for the classification system, which falls under Support because they are supporting the current method.

The passage also mentions "(Ludwig and Klenk, 2001)" in the context of Mollicutes being a monophyletic entity. This is supporting the phylogenetic conclusions, so it's also Support.

Lastly, "(Razin et al., 1998)" is cited for the evolutionary divergence of Mollicutes, which supports the evolutionary explanation, so another Support classification.

Looking at each citation in context, the ones by Lee, Martini, and Zhao are cited to support the current classification method, so their rhetorical class is Support.

[Note: The assistant's thinking leads to the correct rhetorical class for the specific citations as per the task.]
