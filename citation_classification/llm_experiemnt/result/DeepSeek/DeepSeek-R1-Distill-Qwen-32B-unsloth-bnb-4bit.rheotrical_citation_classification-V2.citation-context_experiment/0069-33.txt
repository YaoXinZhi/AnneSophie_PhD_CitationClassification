Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in the given passage. The passage talks about pear decline, mentioning that the disease is caused by a virus and discussing the work of Blodgett et al., Shalla et al., and Jensen et al. from 1963 and 1964. 

Looking at the text, it appears that these citations are providing foundational information about the disease. The passage explains that the virus affects commercial pear varieties when they're grafted onto certain rootstocks, and the vector is the pear psylla. The citations are used to establish the background and previous findings about this disease.

Now, checking the classes. The Basis class is used when the cited work provides the intellectual foundation for the current research. Here, the studies by Blodgett et al. and Shalla et al. (both in 1963) and Jensen et al. (1964) are cited to explain the origins and initial understanding of pear decline. Their work seems to lay the groundwork for the discussion in the current text, making this a Basis situation.

Other classes like CoCoGM or Support don't fit because the passage isn't comparing methods or supporting current findings with theirs. It's more about setting up the context, so Basis is the most appropriate.
