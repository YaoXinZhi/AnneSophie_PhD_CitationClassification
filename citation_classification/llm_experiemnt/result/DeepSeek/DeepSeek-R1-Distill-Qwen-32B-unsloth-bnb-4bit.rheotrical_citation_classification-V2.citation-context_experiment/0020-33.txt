Alright, I need to determine the rhetorical class for the citation (CITSEG) in the given text. The text is about pear decline in Taiwan (PDTW) and discusses the symptoms and methods of detection using phytoplasmas. The specific sentence with the citation is: 

"Since phytoplasmas are non-culturable, PCR amplification of ribosomal RNA genes and the 16S-23S rDNA intergenic spacer region (ISR) have become the conventional means of detecting and identifying them type=""bibr"" target=""#b2"">(Bosco et al., 2002;</ref> type=""bibr"" target=""#b6"">Davies et al., 1995;</ref> type=""bibr"" target=""#b26"">Seem√ºller et al., 1998;</ref>" (CITSEG)."

Looking at the predefined classes, I need to see which one fits best. The sentence mentions that PCR amplification is a conventional method for detecting phytoplasmas and cites several studies that introduced or validated this method. The authors are explaining the methodology they used based on prior works. This fits the "Usage" class because they're referring to the methods or tools from the cited works that they directly used in their current study.

Another possible class might be "Support," but that's more about confirming a claim. Here, it's more about using established methods, so "Usage" is the correct choice.
