Alright, let's try to figure out the rhetorical class for the given citation in the passage. The user provided a scientific text and wants me to classify each citation using specific labels. The passage is about the occurrence of ESFY, mentioning several studies that document its presence in different regions. The citations are all providing evidence of where ESFY has been found. 

Looking at the classes, "Support" seems appropriate here because the citations are backing up the claim that ESFY occurs in various locations. They're cited to show that the information provided is supported by existing research. The author isn't comparing methods or results directly with their study; they're just listing where the pathogen has been found, relying on prior studies for support.

I should check if any other classes fit better. Maybe "Neutral" if it's just mentioning studies without any argument, but in this case, the citations are used to support the assertion about the geographic distribution, so "Support" makes more sense. Also, the passage doesn't compare to other studies or criticize prior work, so "CoCoGM," "Weakness," or others don't fit. It's straightforward support.
