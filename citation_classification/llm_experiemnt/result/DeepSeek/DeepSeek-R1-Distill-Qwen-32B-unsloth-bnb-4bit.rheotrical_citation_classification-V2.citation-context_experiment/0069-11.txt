Alright, so I need to determine the rhetorical class for the citation in the provided passage. The passage is about the advent of pear decline and its relation to rootstocks in pear culture. 

The sentence in question is: "Blodgett et al., 1963; Shalla et al., 1963; Jensen et al., 1964" are cited as (CITSEG). 

Looking at the context, these citations are included right after stating that the pear decline disease manifests in certain rootstocks. The authors are referring to studies that identified the issue with rootstocks and the vector of the disease. 

From the predefined classes, I need to pick the most appropriate one. Let's go through them:

- **Basis**: If it's foundational. But here, the citations are supporting the current claim about pear decline, not serving as the foundation.
- **CoCoGM/CoCoRes/CoCoXY**: Comparisons. The passage isn't comparing methods or results here; it's supporting the current point.
- **Future**: Not about future directions.
- **Motivation**: Not justifying why the research is done.
- **Neutral**: Just a mention without argument support.
- **Similar**: No similarity being highlighted.
- **Support**: The citations are backing up the statement about pear decline and rootstocks.
- **Usage**: Not about methods or tools used.

So, the most fitting class is **Support**, as the citations are used to back up the claim about pear decline and rootstocks.

The citations are used to support the statement about pear decline and its relation to rootstocks. Therefore, the rhetorical class is Support.

**Answer: Support**
