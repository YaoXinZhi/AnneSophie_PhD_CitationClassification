Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in the given text. Let me read through the passage carefully. 

The passage says: "this may be related to the absence in this species of the common duct located at the distal tip of the interlocked maxillary stylets. 'The number of protrusions varies among different species, which may be related to the hardness of the leaves of the host plant' (CITSEG). On the distal extremity of each mandibular stylet tip more than 10 parallel barb-like ridges can be seen in C. chinensis (Fig. ...)."

Hmm, the citation is enclosed in quotes, so it looks like the authors are quoting something someone else said. The sentence before the citation says that something may be related to the absence of a common duct, and then they cite a source that mentions how the number of protrusions varies among species, possibly related to the hardness of the host plant's leaves. 

So, the authors are supporting their own observation by referencing a previous study. They're using the citation to back up their claim about the relationship between the protrusions and the host plant's hardness. That sounds like they're using it to support their argument, so the rhetorical class would be Support.

Let me double-check the definitions. Support is when the citation is used to confirm or reinforce a claim made by the authors. In this case, the authors are making a point about the structure of the species and citing previous work that supports their view. So yes, Support seems right. It's not comparing methods or results, just using the citation to back up their own point.
