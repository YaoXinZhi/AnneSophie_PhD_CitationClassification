Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the given passage. The citation here is mentioned in the context of a scientific methodology. Let me break it down.

The passage says that plant samples were tested using 16SrX group specific primers, and the primers were as published by (CITSEG). That sounds like they're referring to a specific method or tool used in their study. 

Looking at the predefined classes, the 'Usage' class is for when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup that's directly used in the current study. In this case, the primers are a specific tool used in their research, so it fits the 'Usage' category.

I don't think it's 'Support' because they aren't using the cited work to back up their own findings, just referencing the source of their tools. 'CoCoGM' or 'CoCoRes' aren't applicable because they aren't comparing methods or results. 'Motivation' or 'Basis' don't fit here since they're not establishing a foundation for their research or justifying why they're doing the study. 'Neutral' is out because they're specifically using the cited method. 'Weakness' and 'Future' are also not relevant here.

So, the correct class is 'Usage'.
