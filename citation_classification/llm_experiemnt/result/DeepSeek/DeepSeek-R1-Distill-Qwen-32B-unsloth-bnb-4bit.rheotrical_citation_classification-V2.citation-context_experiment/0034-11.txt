Alright, I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in this passage. Let me read it again carefully.

The passage says: "Danet et al. (2011) and recently (CITSEG) could correlate the aceF type A6 to hypo-virulent strains which induce no or only mild symptoms in Prunus. We contributed 22 German isolates [...] to the MLST analysis of (CITSEG). Eight different haplotypes were identified."

First, I notice that the citation (CITSEG) is mentioned twice. The first occurrence is right after Danet et al. (2011), referring to another study by Dermastia et al. (2018). The sentence structure implies that this study also correlated aceF type A6 to hypo-virulent strains. So, the first mention is using (CITSEG) to support the claim about the correlation. Therefore, this could be a "Support" class because it's adding evidence from another study.

The second mention comes when the authors contributed isolates to the MLST analysis of (CITSEG). Here, they're using the cited work's method or framework. They're building on the work by contributing more data. This sounds like using a tool or method from the cited work directly. So, this might be "Usage" because they're utilizing the MLST analysis method from (CITSEG).

Now, I have to decide which class is more appropriate. The first mention supports the claim, but the second use refers to the actual method they're using. However, the passage ends with identifying haplotypes, which is a result of their contribution to the MLST analysis. The focus here is on their contribution and the resulting findings, which directly relates to using the method from the cited work.

So, the primary function here is that they're using (CITSEG)'s MLST analysis method in their study. Therefore, it's a "Usage" case because they're leveraging a tool or method from the cited work.
