Alright, so I need to determine the rhetorical class for the citation (CITSEG) in the given passage. Let me read the passage carefully.

The passage discusses how several species of psyllids are associated with the transmission of 'Ca. P. pyri'. It mentions successful transmission experiments done by Jensen et al. (1964) in North America and the UK. The cited work is (CITSEG), which I think refers to Jensen et al. 1964 here.

Looking at the context around (CITSEG): "Successful phytoplasma transmission experiments... have been carried out in North America... and the UK" (CITSEG). The sentence is presenting results from different studies, with (CITSEG) being one of them. It's comparing the findings across regions—North America and the UK versus France, Italy, Spain, etc.—showing that different researchers have confirmed the vectoring ability in various locations.

Now, referring back to the rhetorical classes, the task is to assign the most appropriate class. The options include CoCoRes, which is for comparing results or findings. Since the citation is part of a discussion comparing where transmission experiments were successful, it's about comparing results across studies. The passage is stating that successful experiments were done in different locations, so (CITSEG) is being cited to compare the results.

I don't think it's Usage because it's not referring to a method they used. They're using the findings, not the methods. It's not Weakness because there's no criticism. It's definitely not Neutral because it's part of a comparative statement.

So, the correct class should be CoCoRes.
