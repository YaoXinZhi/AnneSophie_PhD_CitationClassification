Okay, I need to classify the citation (CITSEG) in the given text into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. Let me first read through the passage carefully to understand the context and how the citation is used.

The passage discusses the number of teeth on the mandibles of different psyllid species. It mentions that (CITSEG) observed the same number of teeth on the mandibles of C. pyricola and Diaphorina citri, and Pollard found 8 teeth in adults of C. mali. So, the citation here is comparing the findings across different studies.

Looking at the rhetorical classes, I need to determine which one fits. The comparison here is between different studies' results, not between the citing paper and another, but among cited works. That would point towards CoCoXY, which is used when comparing two cited studies with each other.

Other classes like CoCoRes are for comparing with the citing paper's results, which isn't the case here. Support is when the citation reinforces the author's own findings, which isn't exactly what's happening here since it's comparing findings across different studies. So, CoCoXY seems to be the correct classification.
