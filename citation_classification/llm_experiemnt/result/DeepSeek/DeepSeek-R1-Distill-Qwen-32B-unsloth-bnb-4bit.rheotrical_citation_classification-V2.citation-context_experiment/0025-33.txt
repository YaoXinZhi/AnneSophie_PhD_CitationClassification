Okay, I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the given citation. Let me read through the passage carefully.

The citation is within quotes and mentions "Subgroups 16SrV-A, -C, -D and -E formed a sister group to 16SrV-B..., which was previously reported as the most divergent lineage..." The citation is referring to Jung et al.'s 2003 work. 

Looking at the context, the current text is discussing the genetic groupings and their relationships. They mention that the sister group was previously reported by Jung et al., so they're using that citation to support their current findings. It seems like they're aligning their results with a prior study, which strengthens their argument.

Now, referring to the rhetorical classes, the one that stands out here is "Support". This is because they're using the cited work to back up their own findings, showing that their observations are consistent with earlier research.

Wait, could it be "Similar"? Hmm, "Similar" points out similarities between the cited work and the current paper. But here, it's more about supporting the claim with prior evidence rather than pointing out a similarity. So "Support" fits better.

Another thought: could it be "Basis"? No, because the cited work isn't the foundation but rather supporting evidence. "CoCoGM" or "CoCoRes" would involve comparison, which isn't the case here. "Usage" is about methods or tools, which isn't applicable. "Weakness" is about critique, which isn't the case. "Neutral" is just mentioning without supporting anything, which it's not. "Future" is about directions, which isn't here either.

So yes, the most appropriate class is "Support".

The citation is used to support the current findings by referencing a prior study that aligns with the results.
