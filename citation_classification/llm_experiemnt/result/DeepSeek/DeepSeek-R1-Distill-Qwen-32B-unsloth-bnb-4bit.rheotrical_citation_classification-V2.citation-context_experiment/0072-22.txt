Alright, I need to determine the rhetorical class of the citation (CITSEG) in the given scientific passage. The predefined classes include Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, and Weakness.

Looking at the passage, the text is discussing the behavior and characteristics of several species, citing various studies. The specific citation (CITSEG) is mentioned after a statement about where the winterform has been recorded. The context is providing evidence or confirmation about the overwintering habits of the species.

This means the citation is being used to support the claim about the winterform's presence outside pear orchards. It's not comparing methods, results, or explaining a concept; it's simply backing up the statement with prior research. Therefore, the most appropriate class is Support, as it's used to reinforce the authors' findings with prior evidence.
