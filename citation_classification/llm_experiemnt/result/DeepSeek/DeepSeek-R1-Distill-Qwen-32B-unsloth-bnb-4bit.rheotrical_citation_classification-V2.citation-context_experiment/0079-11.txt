Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for this particular citation. The text mentions that the first record of European C. pyrisuga in Korea was by Shinji in 1944, and this was repeated by various authors. One of those authors is CITSEG, which is Paik 1963. 

I need to figure out why Paik is cited here. The context is about the first record of this psyllid, and that Shinji's work was repeated by authors like Paik. So, it seems like Paik is being cited as another source that mentions the same finding. 

Looking at the classes, I'm considering 'Support' because Paik is repeating the same information as Shinji, thereby supporting the claim about the first record. However, it's also possible that this is 'Similar' because it's pointing out that multiple authors have made the same observation. 

Wait, the passage is saying that Shinji's work was repeated by various authors, including Paik. So the mention of Paik is to show that multiple sources back up Shinji's initial record. That sounds like evidence supporting the initial claim.

Alternatively, if the focus was on the fact that different methods or conclusions were used, it might fit 'CoCoGM' or 'CoCoRes', but in this case, it's more about confirming the same finding through repetition. So I think 'Support' is the right class because it's used to confirm Shinji's record through multiple citations.

The citation is used to support Shinji's record by showing it was repeated by other authors, thus confirming the information. 

The rhetorical class is Support.
