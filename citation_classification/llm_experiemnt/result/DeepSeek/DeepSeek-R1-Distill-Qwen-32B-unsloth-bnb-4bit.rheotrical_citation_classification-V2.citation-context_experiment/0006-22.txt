Okay, I need to determine the rhetorical class for the citation (CITSEG) in the given passage. Let me read through the text to understand the context.

The passage describes the methods used to collect psyllids: the beat-tray method and sweep net. It mentions that the psyllids were collected using a mouth aspirator and brought to the lab for further analyses. The citation (CITSEG) is right after this sentence.

Looking at the options, I think the citation is referring to a method or tool used in the study. The authors mention using a mouth aspirator, which is a tool, and the citation is right after that. So, they're likely citing a source that provides details on this method of collection.

The possible classes are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, Weakness.

Since the citation is about a method used in the study, the correct class is Usage. The authors are referring to a tool or method from the cited work that they directly used in their research.
