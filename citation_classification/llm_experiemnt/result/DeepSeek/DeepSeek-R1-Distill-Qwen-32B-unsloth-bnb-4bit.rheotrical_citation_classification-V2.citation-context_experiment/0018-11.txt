Alright, I'm trying to figure out which rhetorical class this citation falls into. The passage is talking about records of a species in Korea. It mentions two studies by Kim et al. and others. The way it's cited is just listing that these researchers have reported findings about C. jukyungi.

Looking at the classes, Neutral is when a citation is used in a neutral, descriptive manner without supporting or comparing. Here, it's just stating who found what, without any comparison or support to the current paper's argument. So, Neutral seems right.
