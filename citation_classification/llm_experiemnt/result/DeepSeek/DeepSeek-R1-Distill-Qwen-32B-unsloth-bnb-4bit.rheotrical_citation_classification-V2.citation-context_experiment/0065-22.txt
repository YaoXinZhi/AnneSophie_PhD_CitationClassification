Okay, I'm trying to figure out the correct rhetorical class for this citation. Let me read the passage carefully.

The passage starts by saying that apple trees survive phytoplasma infection for decades, citing (CITSEG). Then it goes on to talk about reductions in various tree parts and compares them to non-infected plants, referencing figures. Next, it mentions pear and peach trees showing less significant differences, with some increases in leaf size, using mixed effect models. The citation is right after the statement about apple trees surviving infection.

Looking at the classes, I need to determine the role of (CITSEG) here. The passage uses the citation to present a fact about apple trees surviving infection, but it doesn't compare methods, results, or motivations. It's more of a neutral statement providing background information. So, this seems like a neutral use of the citation, not supporting, comparing, or criticizing. Therefore, the correct class should be Neutral.

Neutral
