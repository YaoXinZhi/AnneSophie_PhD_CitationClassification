Okay, I need to determine the rhetorical class for the citation (CITSEG) in the given text. Let's break down the passage step by step.

First, the sentences are talking about the management of HLB. The sentence before the citation states that successful management depends on knowing certain relationships. The citation is enclosed in quotes, which suggests that the authors are quoting another study. Then, the next sentence explains the role of psyllid species in spreading the bacteria.

Looking at the classes, "Support" is when the citation reinforces a claim made by the authors. In this case, the authors are asserting that successful management depends on knowledge, and they back this up by citing a study that likely discusses this dependency. So, the cited work supports their statement.

Another possible class is "Basis," but that's more about foundational work. Here, the citation is directly supporting the argument about management depending on knowledge, not setting up a new solution. "Similar" isn't fitting because it's not comparing to another study. "CoCoRes" or "Comparison" classes don't apply since there's no contrast here. It's straightforward support.

Therefore, the correct class is "Support."

The citation is used to support the argument that successful management of HLB depends on understanding specific relationships, aligning with previous research.
