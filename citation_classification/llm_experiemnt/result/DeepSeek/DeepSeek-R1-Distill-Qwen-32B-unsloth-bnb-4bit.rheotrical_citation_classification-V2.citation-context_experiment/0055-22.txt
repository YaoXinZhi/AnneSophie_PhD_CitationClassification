Okay, so I'm trying to classify this citation in the given scientific passage into one of the rhetorical classes provided. The passage is about how certain phytoplasmas change the host plants' morphological and physiological parameters. The citation is cited as (CITSEG) after mentioning that these changes occurred and then the authors describe their own methods and findings. 

First, I need to understand the context. The authors are talking about how these pathogens affect host plants and they're using their own data. The citation is from a previous study that also looked into how these pathogens change their hosts. The authors' own methods include measuring various parameters and discussing their impact on vectors and spread.

Looking at the predefined classes, I need to figure out which one fits best. 

- **Basis**: This would be if the cited work is foundational, but in this case, the authors are discussing their own findings and using the citation as a comparison or support.

- **CoCoGM**: Comparing methods or goals. Here, it's more about the results and findings rather than methods.

- **CoCoRes**: Comparing results. The authors are using the citation to show that their work builds on previous findings. They're not directly comparing results but rather showing that their work supports the existing knowledge.

- **Similar**: Pointing out similarities. The citation shows that their findings align with previous studies, indicating similarity.

- **Support**: The citation is used to support their own claims. Since they mention the same changes in host parameters and their own findings, it strengthens their argument.

- **Usage**: If the citation is about methods, tools, etc. But here it's about findings, not the method.

- **Neutral**: Just a mention without supporting or comparing. But the context suggests they're using it to support their own work.

So, it seems like the citation is used to support their own findings, showing that their work aligns with previous research. Therefore, the most appropriate class is "Support".

The citation is used to support the authors' findings by aligning them with previous research, indicating that their work builds upon existing knowledge.
