Okay, let's try to figure out the rhetorical class for this citation. The passage is talking about B. nigricornis and its potential to transmit CaLsol between carrot and potato crops. It mentions that Hodkinson et al. 1981 confirmed the presence and reproduction of this psyllid on potato crops. 

So, in the context, the citation is used to support the claim that B. nigricornis is present on potato crops. It's providing evidence that this species is indeed found there, which helps to build the case that it could be a vector for CaLsol. 

Looking at the classes, Support fits here because the cited work is being used as evidence to back up the authors' statement about the presence and activity of B. nigricornis on potato crops. The authors are reinforcing their claim with prior research, so it's a supportive role.
