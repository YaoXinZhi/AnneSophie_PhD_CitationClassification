Alright, I need to figure out the rhetorical class of the citation (CITSEG) in the given text. Let's start by reading the passage carefully.

The text describes the methods used to collect insects, mentioning that psyllids were collected using a mouth aspirator and brought to the lab for analysis. The citation here is after this sentence, which seems to detail the process. Looking at the predefined classes, I should determine what role this citation plays.

The citation (CITSEG) is used when describing the method of collecting and analyzing the insects. It's likely referring to a prior study that established or used a similar method. Since the passage is explaining how they collected and analyzed the insects, the citation supports the method used. 

Looking at the classes: Support is when the citation is evidence that aligns with the authors' findings or methods. Usage is when they refer to a method used directly in their study. In this case, it's more about supporting the method, not just mentioning a tool or dataset, but confirming that the method is valid or has been done before. So, the correct class is Support.
