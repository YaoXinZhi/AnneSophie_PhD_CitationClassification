Alright, I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation (CITSEG) in this scientific passage. Let me read through the text carefully.

The passage discusses phytoplasmas inducing defense mechanisms in plants and the role of phytohormones like SA, JA, and ABA. It mentions that witches' broom symptoms can be explained by phytohormone imbalance, citing CITSEG. Then it talks about increased levels of these hormones in infected trees.

I need to decide which rhetorical class this citation falls into. Let's look at the options:

- **Support**: This would be if CITSEG provides evidence backing the argument.
- **CoCoRes**: If it's comparing results.
- **Basis**: If CITSEG is foundational.
- **Similar**: If pointing out similarity.

CITSEG is used to explain symptoms through phytohormone imbalance, so it's supporting the current discussion. The passage is using CITSEG's findings as evidence for their own observations about increased hormone levels.

Therefore, the class is **Support**.

The citation is used to support the claim about phytohormone imbalance explaining symptoms, so it's classified as:

Support

**Answer:** Support
