Alright, so I need to classify the citation (CITSEG) in the given passage into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. Let me start by understanding the classes again to make sure I get it right.

The classes are: Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, Weakness.

Looking at the passage, the sentence with (CITSEG) is: "Liu and Gao (1993) found similar phloem structures in Malus and Pyrus in comparison to Prunus, too" (CITSEG). The context around this is discussing the similarities in phloem structures between Malus, Pyrus, and Prunus, as found by different studies.

In the example given, Nii's study found similar structures in Malus and Pyrus compared to Prunus, and then Liu and Gao also found similar structures. The way it's presented is that both studies found the same kind of results, meaning that Liu and Gao's findings support Nii's findings.

So the role here is that the citation is used to confirm or reinforce a claim made by the current authors. It's not comparing methods or goals, nor is it pointing out weaknesses or suggesting future directions. It's just adding another piece of evidence that supports the same conclusion.

Looking back at the example for the 'Support' class: "All subscales were consistent with previous research, particularly that of (CITSEG) also using a U.S. sample; as before, participants did not distinguish..." Here, the citation supports the authors' findings by aligning with previous research. Similarly, in our case, the citation supports the current authors' observation by showing another study found the same results.

I don't think it's 'Similar' because 'Similar' is about pointing out a similarity between the cited work and the current paper, but here both studies are similar in their findings, supporting the current argument. 'Support' is more appropriate because it's directly used as evidence to back up the claim.

So, the classification should be 'Support'.
