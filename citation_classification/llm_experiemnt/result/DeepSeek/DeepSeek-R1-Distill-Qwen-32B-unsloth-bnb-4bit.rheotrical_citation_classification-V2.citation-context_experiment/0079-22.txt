Alright, let's try to figure out the rhetorical class for this citation. The passage is talking about the first record of a species in Korea and mentions that Shinji's work was repeated by others, which includes the CITSEG. The context is more about reporting prior work without comparing or supporting the current study's claims. There's no support, comparison, or criticism hereâ€”it's just mentioning previous findings neutrally. So it looks like a Neutral class.
