Okay, so I have to figure out the rhetorical class for the (CITSEG) citation in the given text. Let me start by reading the passage carefully.

The passage starts by talking about B. nigricornis and mentions that it's been found on carrot and potato crops in Europe. It then quotes a statement about the potential transmission of CaLsol between these crops. The next part refers to a citation that's in the text, which is Hodkinson et al. 1981. The sentence says that the reproduction and presence of B. nigricornis on potato crops has been confirmed by this study, and it then mentions the severe yield losses in Iran.

Looking at the classes, I need to determine what role this citation plays. It seems the citation is supporting the claim that B. nigricornis is present on potato crops, which is important for their argument about its potential as a vector. The Hodkinson et al. study confirms the presence, so the citation is used as evidence to back up this point.

Another point to consider is the other citations mentioned, like Fathi et al. 2011, which talks about yield losses, but that's a separate point. The main focus is on how the cited work supports the argument about the presence and role of the psyllid.

So, checking the classes: Support is when the citation is used to back up a claim. In this case, yes, the citation supports that B. nigricornis is present and thus could be a vector. There's no comparison here, it's just using the study as evidence. Therefore, the correct class should be 'Support.'
