Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in this text. Let me read through the passage carefully.

The passage starts by talking about Cacopsylla species feeding on pear and mentions their effects on trees and fruits. It then cites (CITSEG) specifically when discussing successful phytoplasma transmission experiments in the UK. After that, it lists other studies confirming the vectoring ability in France, Italy, Spain, and others.

The part where (CITSEG) is cited is in the context of mentioning Jensen et al.'s successful experiments in North America and the UK. The authors are presenting these as evidence that C. pyricola is a vector. They're supporting their own claim about the vectoring ability by citing this study.

Looking at the rhetorical classes, "Support" is when the citation is used to back a claim. The passage is using Jensen et al.'s work as evidence to support their assertion about C. pyricola's vectoring ability. It's not comparing methods or results with another study or their own; it's directly confirming their point.

So, the correct class should be "Support."
