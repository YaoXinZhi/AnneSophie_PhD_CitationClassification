Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for this citation in the given scientific passage. The passage is discussing DNA barcoding and its applications in identifying pests, specifically pear psyllids. The citation in question is referring to Hebert and Ratnasingham, 2007; Park et al., 2010; and Shin et al., 2013. 

First, let me look at the sentence where the citation is placed: "It is commonly used for identification of quarantine and agricultural pests (CITSEG)." This part is stating that DNA barcoding is a method used for identifying certain pests, and the citation is supporting this claim. 

The question is, which rhetorical class does this fall into? The options are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, Weakness.

Looking at the classes, "Support" seems likely because the citation is used to back up the statement that DNA barcoding is commonly used for pest identification. The authors are citing previous research that demonstrates this application, thereby reinforcing their point.

Let me go through the other options to be sure. "Basis" would be if the cited work is foundational to the current research, but here it's more about supporting a general statement rather than forming the basis of the study. "CoCoGM" is for comparing goals or methods, which isn't the case here. "Support" fits because the citation aligns with the authors' claim. 

Yes, I think "Support" is the correct class because the authors are using the citations to back up their assertion about the common usage of DNA barcoding in pest identification.
