Alright, I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in the given passage. Let me read through the text again to understand the context.

The sentence is: "Ca. 'Liberibacter americanus' is common in the Americas, and 'Ca. Liberibacter africanus' occurs in Africa type=""bibr"" target=""#b7"">(Gottwald 2010;</ref> type=""bibr"" target=""#b17"">Lin 1956;</ref> type=""bibr"" target=""#b20"">McLean and Oberholz 1965;</ref>" (CITSEG). Ca. 'Liberibacter solanacearum', also known as 'Ca."

Okay, so the text is discussing different Liberibacter species and their distribution. The citations are given after stating where each species is found. The citations are in the form of (CITSEG) but seem to refer to multiple sources: Gottwald 2010, Lin 1956, McLean and Oberholz 1965.

Looking at the rhetorical classes, I need to see which one fits. The passage mentions the distribution of Liberibacter species and cites studies that describe this. So the citations are supporting the claim about their distribution.

The class "Support" is when a citation reinforces or confirms a point. Here, the authors are stating facts about where these bacteria are found and citing previous studies that document these occurrences. So the citations are used to back up their statements about the species' distribution.

I don't think it's "Usage" because they're not using a method or tool from the cited work. It's not "CoCoGM" or "CoCoRes" because they're not comparing their methods or results with the cited works. They're just presenting established facts supported by prior research.

So the most appropriate class is "Support".
