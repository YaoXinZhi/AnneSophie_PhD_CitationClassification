Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify this citation. The passage is talking about phytoplasmas and their impact on vector insects, specifically psyllids. So, the sentence in question is about how psyllid nymphs and adults feed on plant phloem and xylem sap, and it cites [31] and [32].

Looking at the context, the main point is describing the feeding behavior of psyllids. The citation appears right after this statement, suggesting that the cited works support this information. The authors are using the cited studies to back up their claim about psyllid feeding habits. 

In the predefined classes, "Support" is when a citation is used to reinforce a claim made by the authors. Since [31] and [32] are providing evidence for the feeding behavior mentioned, they fit into the Support category. There's no comparison, motivation, or neutral mention here. It's purely backing up the statement.

So, the rhetorical class for this citation is Support.
