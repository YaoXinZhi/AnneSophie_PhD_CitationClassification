Okay, so I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. The passage is about an experiment where a magnetic field is applied to hard water to prevent scale formation. The researchers are citing their previous work which showed the effectiveness of the magnetic treatment but didn't explain the mechanism. The current work aims to understand this mechanism.

Looking at the context, the citation is pointing out that while their previous research showed a result, the underlying reason wasn't understood yet. So the current study is motivated by this gap. That aligns with the Motivation category because it identifies a need to address an open question from prior work.
</think>

Step 1: The citation references the author's previous research that demonstrated the effectiveness of magnetic fields in preventing scale formation but did not explain the mechanism, highlighting a knowledge gap.

Step 2: The intent is to identify a knowledge gap that motivates the current research.

Step 3: The rhetorical class is Motivation.

#OUTPUT
Motivation
