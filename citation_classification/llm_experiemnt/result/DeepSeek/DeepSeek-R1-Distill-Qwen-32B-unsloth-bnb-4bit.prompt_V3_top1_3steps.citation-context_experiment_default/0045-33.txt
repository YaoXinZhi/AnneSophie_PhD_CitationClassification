Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the right rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the authors have identified a pathogenic isolate of Xylella fastidiosa, specifically strain 9a5c, from stone fruit plants. They are comparing this isolate to the strain found in olive trees in Southern Italy. 

Next, I'll identify the general intent of the citation. In this case, they're comparing results from their current study with those of a previous study. They're showing that their findings, while related, are distinct. This comparison is about the results or findings from the cited work.

Looking at the definitions, CoCoRes (Comparison of Results) is used when the citation is directly comparing results or findings. The passage is doing exactly that by highlighting the differences between their isolate and the one in Italy. 

So, the most appropriate label here is CoCoRes since it's a direct comparison of results between studies.

The citation compares the results of the current study with a previous one, focusing on the isolate findings.
