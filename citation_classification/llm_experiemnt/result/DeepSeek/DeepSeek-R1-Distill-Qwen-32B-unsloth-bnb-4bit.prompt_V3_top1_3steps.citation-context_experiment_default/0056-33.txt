Alright, I'm trying to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context according to the predefined rhetorical classes. Let me go through the process step by step.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions using a specific technique and references a citation, saying that they followed this technique as per the cited work.

Next, I should determine the general intent of the citation. The authors are stating that they used a method described in the cited paper, which indicates that they're referencing a method or tool from the cited work.

Looking at the rhetorical classes, the Usage category fits here since it's about using a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup from the cited work directly in the current study. The example given for Usage is when the citation refers to a tool or method used, which is exactly what's happening here.

So, putting it all together, the citation is used to indicate that the method was directly applied in their research, making "Usage" the most appropriate label.

The citation is used to indicate that a specific technique was followed as per the cited work, which falls under the Usage rhetorical class.
