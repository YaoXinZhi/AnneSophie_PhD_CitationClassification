Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given plant health passage. Let's go through each step carefully.

Step 1: Extract the context around @@CITATION@@. The sentence is: "Previous studies have shown that certain phytoplasmas are associated with diseases in plants @@CITATION@@, and this has significant implications for agricultural practices." The key part here is that the citation is about previous studies showing a connection between phytoplasmas and plant diseases.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation is being used to support the idea that phytoplasmas cause plant diseases, which is a key point in the current discussion. So it's probably supportive.

Step 3: Select the specific label. From the list, 'Support' is the one where the citation confirms or backs up the authors' findings. The passage uses the citation to affirm the association, so 'Support' is appropriate.

The citation is used to affirm the association between phytoplasmas and plant diseases, supporting the current discussion.
