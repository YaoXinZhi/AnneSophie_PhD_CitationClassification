Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me go through the steps one by one.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage is: "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@." So, the sentence is just providing a factual statement about the spread of magnetic devices in the USA since a certain year, and citing a source for this information.

Next, I need to identify the general intent of the citation. The sentence is descriptive, stating a fact without expressing any judgment, comparison, or motivation. It's simply providing information about when and where the use started to spread. There's no indication that the citation is being used to compare with another study, support another point, or identify a gap in knowledge.

Looking at the predefined classes, the context here doesn't fit into any of the comparison categories (CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY) because there's no comparison being made. It's not a motivation or future direction either. The citation isn't used to point out any weakness or to support a claim; it's just a neutral statement.

The example provided for Neutral is very similar: "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@." It's a straightforward fact with a citation, no underlying argument or comparison. So, the general intent here is neutral, and it fits the Neutral class.

Therefore, the most appropriate label is Neutral.
