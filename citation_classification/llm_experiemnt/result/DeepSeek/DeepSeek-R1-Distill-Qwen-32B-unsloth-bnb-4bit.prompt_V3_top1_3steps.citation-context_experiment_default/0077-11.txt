Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to classify a citation in a scientific article into a specific rhetorical category. The passage provided is about plant health, and the citation in question is @@CITATION@@. 

First, I should understand the context of the citation. The example provided is about the multiplication rates of 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' in daisy plants. The authors mention that different studies have conflicting results. They reference Wei et al. (2004) and Saracco et al. (2006), and then cite another study in @@CITATION@@ which shows conflicting results for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima.

Looking at the context, the key point is that they're pointing out conflicting findings between two studies. The example given compares two citations and mentions that conflicting results were described in another citation. This means they're using the citations to compare or contrast the explanations or claims made in the cited works themselves, not directly comparing to their own study's findings.

So, based on the definitions provided, the rhetorical class that fits here is CoCoXY. CoCoXY refers to when a citation is used to compare or contrast two cited studies with each other, not with the citing paper. The passage is discussing different studies and their conflicting results, thus it's a comparative statement between the studies, not about their own results or motivations.

I don't think it's any of the other classes. It's not a foundational work (Basis), nor is it comparing goals or methods (CoCoGM). It's not support or weakness because they're not directly supporting or criticizing their own work. It's a direct comparison between cited studies, so CoCoXY is the right fit.
