Okay, so I need to figure out how to classify the given citation @@CITATION@@ in the scientific article passage. Let's go through the steps as instructed.

First, I should extract the context around the citation. Looking at the passage, it says, "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria." Then it mentions the citation. So the context is that the current study's finding is being supported by another study's results.

Next, I need to identify the general intent. The current authors are using the cited work to support their findings. They're saying that similar results have been found elsewhere, which strengthens their own conclusions. That points towards a supportive intent.

Now, looking at the predefined classes, Support is when the citation is used to confirm or back up the citing authors' work. The passage directly states that the finding is "supported by recent cross-taxon investigations," which fits the Support category. There's no comparison or criticism here; it's purely about backing up their results with another study's findings.

So, putting it all together, the correct rhetorical class is Support.
