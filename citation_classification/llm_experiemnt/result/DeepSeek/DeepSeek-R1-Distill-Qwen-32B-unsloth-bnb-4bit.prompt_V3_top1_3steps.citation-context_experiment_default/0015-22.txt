Alright, let me tackle this problem step by step. The task is to classify a citation within a scientific article passage into one of several predefined rhetorical classes. 

First, I need to carefully read the passage provided and understand how the citation is being used. The passage given is: "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@." The citation here is referring to the spread of magnetic water treatment devices in the USA starting in 1975.

Step 1: Extract the context around the citation. The context here is about the adoption and spread of a specific technology. The citation provides historical information without any indication of supporting, comparing, or otherwise engaging the cited work beyond a descriptive mention.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. Looking at the context, the citation isn't used to establish a foundation, motivate research, support a claim, compare methods or results, suggest future work, or criticize the cited work. It's merely stating a fact: the spread of these devices began in 1975 in the USA.

Step 3: Assign the rhetorical class. From the definitions provided, the Neutral class is used when the citation is mentioned without any supporting, comparative, critical, or motivational intent. Since the citation is simply providing a factual context without advancing an argument or comparison, it fits the Neutral category.
