Alright, let me go through this step by step. I need to determine the rhetorical class for the citation in the given context. 

First, I look at the context provided. It mentions that the hard calcite scale on surfaces exposed to hard water can be prevented with a magnetic field. The current work aims to understand the mechanism behind this. The citation is referred to as "Our previous research @@CITATION@@ has shown that..." 

I need to extract the context discussing the citation. It seems like the citation is used to indicate that prior research by the authors themselves showed the prevention of scale using a magnetic field, and now they are building on that to understand the mechanism. 

Next, I identify the general intent. Since the citation is explaining why the current research is being conducted, pointing out a knowledge gap (the mechanism isn't yet explained), it falls under the Motivation category.

Now, selecting the specific rhetorical class from the predefined list, Motivation is the appropriate label here because the citation is justifying the current research's purpose by referencing a previous study.

The citation is used to justify the reason behind the current research, hence it's a Motivation.

**Step-by-step Explanation:**
1. The citation mentions previous research showing the prevention of scale using a magnetic field.
2. The current work is conducted to understand the mechanism behind this phenomenon.
3. This indicates the citation is used to motivate the current research by identifying a knowledge gap.

**Answer:**
Motivation
