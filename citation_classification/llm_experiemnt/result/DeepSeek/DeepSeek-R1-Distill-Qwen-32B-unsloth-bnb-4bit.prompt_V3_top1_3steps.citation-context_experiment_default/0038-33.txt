Okay, I'm trying to figure out which rhetorical class the citation @@CITATION@@ falls into for this plant health text. Let me break it down.

First, the passage says, "In the USA, the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@." Now, I need to extract the context. The sentence is simply stating a fact about the spread of these devices in the USA since 1975, citing a source for this information.

Looking at the intent, the citation doesn't seem to be foundational, motivational, or technical. It's not comparing anything (so not CoCoGM, CoCoRes, or CoCoXY) or supporting the author's point beyond stating a fact. There's no weakness or criticism here either. Instead, it's just providing information without any argumentative stance.

So, it fits into the Neutral category because the citation is used descriptively without supporting, comparing, criticizing, or motivating anything. It's just a factual statement.
