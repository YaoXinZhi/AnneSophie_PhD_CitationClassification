Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. 

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions recent studies suggesting that the root system plays a crucial role in plant health. It then cites these studies without any additional commentary or comparison. 

Next, I need to identify the general intent. Since the citation is used to reference studies that support the statement about the root system's importance, it seems like the intention is to support the current argument. 

Looking at the predefined classes, 'Support' is when the citation confirms or backs up the work, results, or findings of the current authors. The passage doesn't compare, criticize, or suggest future workâ€”it simply corroborates the point. 

So, the most appropriate label here is Support.
</think>

The citation is used to support the current paper's argument by referencing studies that corroborate the importance of the root system.
