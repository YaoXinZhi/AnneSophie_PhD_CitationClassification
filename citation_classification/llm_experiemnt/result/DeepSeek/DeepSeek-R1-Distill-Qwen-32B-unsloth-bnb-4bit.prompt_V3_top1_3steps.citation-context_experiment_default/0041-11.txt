Okay, so I need to determine the rhetorical class of the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me go through the process step by step.

First, I should extract the context discussing the citation. The context provided is: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." So, the key part here is "the experimental set-up was described in detail previously," and the citation refers to a previous work that described this setup.

Next, I need to identify the general intent of the citation. The sentence mentions that the setup was described in detail previously, which suggests that the authors are referring to a method or tool used in their current study. It looks like they're citing a source that provided the method they used.

Looking at the predefined classes, the most fitting category here is "Usage." This is because the citation is referring to a method or experimental setup from a previous work, which is directly used in the current study. The authors are indicating that they employed a method described elsewhere, so they're using it as a tool for their research.

I don't think it's "Basis" because the study isn't building on the intellectual foundation of previous work; it's just using a method. It's not a "Support" because they're not confirming findings; they're applying a method. Similarly, it's not "Comparison" or any other category because the focus is solely on using a previously described setup.

The citation refers to the usage of a method or experimental setup from a previous study in the current research.
