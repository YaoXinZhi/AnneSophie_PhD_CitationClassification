Okay, so I'm trying to determine the correct rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. The passage is about the occurrence of several species of pear psyllids in China. The context mentions that eighteen species were described from China, but their taxonomic status is problematic. This suggests that the cited work might have some issues or uncertainties regarding the classification of these species. 

Step 1: Extract the context. The context is the sentence: "The taxonomic status of these species is problematic and some may not develop on Pyrus @@CITATION@@." 

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation is pointing out that the taxonomic status is problematic, which indicates criticism or limitation in the cited work.

Step 3: Assign the specific rhetorical class. Since the issue is pointing out a limitation or problem in the cited work, the appropriate label is "Weakness."
