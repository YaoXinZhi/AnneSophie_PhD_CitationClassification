Okay, let's try to figure out the rhetorical class for this citation. The passage doesn't provide specific text, so I'll have to think through possible scenarios. 

First, I need to remember the different classes: Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Motivation, Future, Support, Similar, Usage, Weakness, and Neutral.

If the citation is introducing a foundational study that the current research builds upon, it would be Basis. If they're comparing their methods or goals, that's CoCoGM. Comparing results would be CoCoRes. If they're comparing two studies without involving their own, it's CoCoXY. 

If the citation is explaining why the research is needed, it's Motivation. If it's suggesting future research, it's Future. Support would mean they're backing up their results. Similar is pointing out a resemblance between studies. Usage would be using a method from the cited work. Weakness would be criticizing the cited work. And Neutral is just stating information without any judgment.

Since there's no context, I might default to Neutral because without specific information, the citation could just be stating something without supporting, comparing, or criticizing. 

But wait, if the citation is part of a discussion of related work without a clear intent, Neutral makes sense. So, I'll go with Neutral.
