Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let's start by looking at the context provided. The passage says that the citation is mentioned after discussing the multiplication rates and high concentration of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains in young developing leaves and roots of infected daisy plants from two previous studies by Wei et al., 2004, and Saracco et al., 2006. The passage then mentions conflicting results described by another study. It says, "although conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima @@CITATION@@."

So, breaking this down, the context is comparing two results. One set of studies found high concentrations in certain plants, and another study found conflicting results in a different plant. The citation @@CITATION@@ is being used to contrast these findings. It's comparing the results of one study with another, not directly with the current paper's results. Therefore, it's a comparison of two cited studies' explanations or claims, which fits under CoCoXY.

The other rhetorical classes don't apply here. It's not a comparison of methods or goals (which would be CoCoGM), nor is it comparing results with their own work (CoCoRes). It's not being used for motivation, support, or as a foundation. It's a direct comparison between two citations to highlight conflicting results, so CoCoXY is the right choice.
