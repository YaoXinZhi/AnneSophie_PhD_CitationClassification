Alright, let's break this down. I'm trying to figure out how to classify the citation in the given context. So, the passage is about the study of plant pathogens and mentions that the genus 'Candidatus Liberibacter' was reported in several studies. They also reference a specific study that described the occurrence of 'Ca. L. solanacearum' in tomatoes and potatoes. 

First, I need to understand the context around the citation. The citation here is providing support for the fact that 'Ca. L. solanacearum' affects tomatoes and potatoes. The sentence structure suggests that the authors are backing up their statement with this study, meaning they're using it to confirm their findings or add credibility.

Looking at the classification options, 'Support' is when the citation is used to confirm the citing authors' work. In this case, the study is cited to back up the occurrence of the pathogen in specific plants, which aligns perfectly with the Support category. There's no comparison or motivation implied, just a straightforward use of the citation to support a point.

Step 1: The context discusses how 'Ca. L. solanacearum' infects tomato and potato crops and cites a study that specifically describes this occurrence.

Step 2: The intent is to support the statement about the pathogen's presence in these crops.

Step 3: The specific rhetorical class is Support because the citation is used to confirm or add credibility to the presented information.

"Support"
