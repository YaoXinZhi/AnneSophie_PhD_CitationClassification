Okay, so I need to classify the cited reference @@CITATION@@ in the given passage into a specific rhetorical class. Let's start by understanding the context and following the steps outlined.

First, the user provided an example where the citation is embedded within a sentence discussing the formation of hard calcite scales. The passage mentions that the phenomenon's explanation isn't yet offered and that the current work aims to understand the mechanism. 

Step 1: Extract the context. The sentence starts with "Our previous research @@CITATION@@ has shown..." and explains how magnetic fields prevent scale formation. The citation here refers to prior work by the same authors.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation is used to justify the current research by highlighting a knowledge gapâ€”specifically, that the mechanism isn't yet explained. This aligns with the "Motivation" category because it's setting up why this study is important.

Step 3: Choose the specific rhetorical class. Since the citation is explaining the reason for conducting the new research, it fits under "Motivation." It's not supporting previous results, comparing methods, or pointing out weaknesses. Instead, it's motivating the current study by identifying an open question.

The citation is used to justify the current research by identifying a knowledge gap, thus it is categorized as Motivation.
