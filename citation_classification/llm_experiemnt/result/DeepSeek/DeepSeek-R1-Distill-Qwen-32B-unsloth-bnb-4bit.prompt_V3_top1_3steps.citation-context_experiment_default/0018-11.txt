Okay, so I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. Let me go through the steps as instructed.

First, I extract the context around the citation. The passage says: "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@." It's a neutral statement providing historical context about the spread of magnetic water treatment devices in the USA without any supporting, comparing, or criticizing elements.

Next, I determine the general intent. The citation is presenting information in a factual manner without trying to support, compare, motivate, or critique anything. It's purely descriptive.

Then, I assign the most appropriate rhetorical class. Since the intent is neutral and the citation is used to describe a fact without any other purpose, the class is Neutral.
