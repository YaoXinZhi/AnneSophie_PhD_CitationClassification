Alright, I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. First, I'll extract the context around the citation to understand its role.

Looking at the passage: The citation is part of a sentence discussing the results of an experiment on the hard calcite scale formed by hard water and the effect of magnetic treatment. The passage states that previous research showed the formation could be prevented with a magnetic field and that the current work aims to explain this mechanism, citing @@CITATION@@.

Step 1: The context is about prior research showing prevention of scale formation using magnetic fields, and the current study's purpose is to understand the underlying mechanism.

Step 2: The general intent seems to be justification or motivation. The citation is explaining why the current research is being conducted because it references a previous finding that observed an effect without explaining it.

Step 3: The specific class here is 'Motivation' because the citation is used to justify the current research by pointing out that previous work identified a phenomenon that hasn't been explained yet, thus setting the stage for the current study's purpose.

So the most appropriate label is 'Motivation'.
</think>

The citation provides the reason for conducting the current research, referencing prior work that identified an effect needing explanation.
