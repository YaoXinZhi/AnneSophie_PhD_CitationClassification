Okay, so I need to assign a rhetorical class to a citation in a scientific passage. First, I'll look at the passage to understand the context around the citation. The example given is:

"In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@."

I need to break this down step by step. 

Step 1: Extract the context. The sentence talks about the spread of magnetic water treatment devices in the USA since a certain year, citing a source. The context is about the historical adoption of these devices.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation seems to be providing a factual statement without supporting, comparing, or criticizing. It's simply describing a trend.

Step 3: Assign the specific class. Looking at the definitions, "Neutral" is used when the citation is descriptive without any specific argument. This fits because the sentence is just stating a fact without any comparative, motivational, or critical intent. 

So, the rhetorical class should be Neutral.
