Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific article passage. Let's start by understanding the context of the citation.

Step 1: Extract the context discussing the citation. From the passage, it says: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." So, the context is about a method or setup that was described in detail in a previous work.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The sentence is referencing a previous study that explained the setup. This means the current paper is using that setup, so it's about using a method from another source.

Looking at the predefined classes, the intent seems to be related to using a method or setup from another study. The class that matches this is "Usage," which refers to citations that mention methods, tools, datasets, or experimental setups used in the current study.

So, the rhetorical class should be "Usage."
