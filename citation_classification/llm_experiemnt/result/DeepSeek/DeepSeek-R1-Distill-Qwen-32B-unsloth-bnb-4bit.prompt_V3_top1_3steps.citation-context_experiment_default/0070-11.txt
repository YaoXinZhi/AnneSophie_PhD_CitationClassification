Okay, I need to assign the correct rhetorical class to the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage about plant health. The passage is within backticks, so let's first extract that context. The context mentions that recent research by @@CITATION@@ found that increasing CO2 levels significantly increased plant growth, but another study pointed out conflicting results regarding yield under drought conditions. The task is to determine the rhetorical class of @@CITATION@@.

Step 1: Extract the context. The context is: "Earlier this year, @@CITATION@@ reported that the growth of wheat crops increased by about 15% when grown under elevated CO2 conditions. However, recent research by @@CITATION@@ found that increasing CO2 levels significantly increased plant growth, but another study pointed out conflicting results regarding yield under drought conditions."

Wait, the user provided a specific example in the context with two different citations, but in the current task, the @@CITATION@@ is the second one, which mentions conflicting results.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation is discussing conflicting results regarding yield under drought conditions. So it's comparing results from the cited work with another cited work, not directly with the current paper since both are cited but compared against each other.

Step 3: Assign the specific rhetorical class. Looking at the definitions, CoCoXY is when two cited studies are compared with each other. The passage mentions that the @@CITATION@@ (the second citation) had conflicting results with another study, so they are comparing two results from different cited papers. Therefore, the class is CoCoXY.

The citation @@CITATION@@ is used to compare conflicting results from two studies, indicating a comparison between cited works. 

The final answer is:

CoCoXY
