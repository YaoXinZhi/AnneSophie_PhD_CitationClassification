Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class of the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me go through each step as instructed.

First, I need to extract the context discussing the citation. The passage is about a study on apple decline symptoms and mentions the work of @@CITATION@@, which showed that "Candidatus Phytoplasma mali" is associated with a phytopathy resembling apple decline. They also mention that "Candidatus Phytoplasma prunus" was detected in a cherry tree showing symptoms similar to prune dwarfing.

Next, I have to identify the general intent of the citation. The authors are comparing the findings of their current study with previous research. They note that while the cited study found a certain phytoplasma in apple trees, their work detected a different one in a cherry tree. This seems like a comparison of results, indicating that their findings are different from the cited work.

Now, looking at the predefined classes, I see that CoCoRes involves comparing results or findings. Since the passage is contrasting their results with those of the cited study, this fits under CoCoRes.
