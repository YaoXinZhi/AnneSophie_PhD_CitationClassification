Alright, let me try to figure out how to classify this citation. So, the task is to determine the rhetorical class of the citation @@CITATION@@ based on the context provided. I've got to follow three steps: extract the context, identify the general intent, and then choose the specific class.

First, I'll look at the context given. It says: "We examined the effect of three plant species on soil pH in their respective growth environments. Our findings align closely with previous studies, particularly those by @@CITATION@@, which reported the pH-altering capabilities of certain plant species." 

Hmm, so in this passage, the authors are talking about their findings matching previous studies. The citation is mentioned right after the phrase "align closely with," which indicates that their results support the cited work.

Now, for Step 2, identifying the general intent. Since the authors are saying their findings align with the cited study, it seems supportive. They're using the citation to back up their results, not to compare, motivate, or critique. So that points towards a supportive intent.

Step 3 is to pick the specific rhetorical class. The options under supportive are Support and Similar. Support means the citation is backing up their own work, while Similar is pointing out a similarity in results or observations between the cited work and theirs. In this case, it's more about their findings aligning with previous studies, which suggests they are supporting their work with the cited study. 

Wait, actually, the example for Support says it's used to confirm the citing authors' work. Here, they explicitly say their findings align with the cited work, which means they're using it to support their own results. So Support seems appropriate.

Alternatively, could it be Similar? The example for Similar mentions pointing out a similarity, often in results, patterns, or phenomena. Here, they do mention their findings aligning, so maybe Similar? But looking at the definitions, Support is when the citation is used to back up their own findings. Since they are confirming their results with the cited study, Support fits better.

Hmm, no, wait. The example for Support: "Our finding is consistent with previous research, particularly that of @@CITATION@@..." which is exactly what this is. So yes, Support is correct.
</think>

The passage uses the citation to confirm their findings with previous research, thus it's a Support.
