Okay, so I need to determine the rhetorical class of the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by reading through the context and understanding what's going on.

The passage is about plant health, specifically discussing a study related to aphid gut peptides interfering with virus uptake. The citation is mentioned in the context of a finding where a small aphid gut peptide interferes with the uptake of enamoviruses from the aphid's gut into the hemocoel. It's noted that this peptide also binds to the gut epithelia of two other aphid species, suggesting potential broader applicability. The citation here seems to support the idea that the peptide could have wider uses.

Looking at the examples, one of them for the 'Future' class mentions citing a study that supports broader applicability and implies future research directions. In this case, the citation is used to suggest that the findings could apply to more species, which points towards future possibilities in research.

So, the citation is highlighting the potential for expanding the application of the peptide, which falls under suggesting future research directions. Therefore, the rhetorical class should be 'Future'.
