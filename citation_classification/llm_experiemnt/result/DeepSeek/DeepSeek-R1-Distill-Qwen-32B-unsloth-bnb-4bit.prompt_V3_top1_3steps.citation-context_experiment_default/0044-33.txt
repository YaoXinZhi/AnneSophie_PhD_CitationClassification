Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by breaking down the process step by step.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage says that the study found a species, Xiphinema diversicaudatum, on Chenopodium album and other hosts. They mention that earlier findings in @@CITATION@@ reported only a few cases of C. album as a host for Xiphinema species. 

So, from this, I understand that the current study is citing another work that has some similar results. The current authors are pointing out that previous studies didn't find many instances of C. album as a host, but their new findings support this. 

Next, I need to identify the general intent of the citation. Since the current study is using the cited work to back up their own observations about the host plant species, it seems like the purpose is to support their findings. 

Looking at the predefined classes, "Support" would be the appropriate label here because the citation is being used to confirm or corroborate the research results. The example given for Support matches this scenario where previous research is cited to show consistency with current findings.

I don't think it's any of the other classes like CoCoRes because the intention isn't to compare results directly with the current study but rather to back them up. It's not a comparison of goals or methods (CoCoGM), nor is it pointing out a weakness or a similar study without direct support. So, Support fits best.
