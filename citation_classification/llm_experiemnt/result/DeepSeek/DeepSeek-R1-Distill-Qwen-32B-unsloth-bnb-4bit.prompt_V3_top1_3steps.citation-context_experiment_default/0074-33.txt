Okay, so I need to classify the citation reference @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. First, I should understand what the passage is about. The user provided a context where the citation is discussed. 

Wait, I see the context is: "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@@."

So the passage mentions that the finding by the authors is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations. They are pointing out that similar results were found in fleas and ticks. 

The general intent of the citation here is to support their own findings. The citation is used to back up their results with similar studies. 

Looking at the rhetorical classes, Support is when the citation is used to confirm the work or findings of the current paper. In the example provided for Support, it's mentioned that the subscales were consistent with previous research, and here, the current finding is supported by other studies. 

So, the specific label should be Support because the citation is presented as confirming their results.

Support
