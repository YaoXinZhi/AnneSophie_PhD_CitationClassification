Alright, I need to assign a rhetorical class to the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let's start by extracting the context.

The passage mentions that recent research showed certain species on cultivated and wild pear in China. The authors state that their findings are similar, specifically pointing out that the taxonomic status of these species is problematic and possibly not valid on Pyrus. 

Looking at the intent, the authors are using the cited work to highlight a similarity in issues regarding taxonomic status. They're not supporting their own results with it, nor are they comparing methods or results directly. Instead, they're indicating that the cited work's findings are similar, which aligns with the 'Similar' class because it points out a shared observation about the species' problematic classification on Pyrus.

No other classes like 'Weakness' or 'Support' fit here because the focus isn't on flaws in the cited work or confirmation of their own results, but rather a parallel issue noted in both studies.

The citation is used to point out a similarity between the cited work's observation of problematic taxonomic status and the current findings.

Step 1: The context discusses a cited study describing species on pear, noting issues with their taxonomic status.

Step 2: The intent is to highlight a similarity in the taxonomic issues observed in both studies.

Step 3: The appropriate label is 'Similar' as it's pointing out a shared problem in classification.
