Alright, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. First, I'll extract the context. The passage is about plant health and discusses a specific phenomenon, citing a reference by "Wei et al." and "Saracco et al." The context mentions conflicting results regarding the concentration of a phytoplasma strain. 

Next, I'll identify the general intent. The sentence compares findings from two studies (Wei et al., 2004 and Saracco et al., 2006) with another study (the citation) that describes conflicting results for a different phytoplasma. This shows the citation is being used to contrast two studies, not comparing them to the current paper.

Finally, selecting the rhetorical class. Since the citation is comparing two cited studies, it's an example of CoCoXY.

CoCoXY
