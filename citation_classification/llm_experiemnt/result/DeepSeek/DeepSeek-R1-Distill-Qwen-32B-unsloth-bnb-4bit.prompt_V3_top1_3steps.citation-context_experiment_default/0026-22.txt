Okay, let's try to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the provided plant health context. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The user hasn't provided the specific passage, so I'll assume I have access to it. Once I have that, I'll look for indicators of how the citation is used. 

Next, I need to determine the general intent. Is it foundational, comparative, motivational, etc.? Then, I'll match it to the specific class from the given list. 

Without the exact context, I can't be sure, but let's say the citation is providing a foundation for the study. If so, the class would be Basis. If it's comparing methods, CoCoGM. If supporting a finding, then Support. If just a neutral mention, Neutral. 

I'll need to see how the citation is integrated into the argument to choose accurately.
