Alright, I'm given a task to classify a citation in a plant health scientific article into one of several predefined rhetorical classes. The citation is tagged as @@CITATION@@ and is embedded within a passage. My job is to follow the three-step process outlined to determine the appropriate label.

First, I need to extract the context where the citation appears. The example provided in the task mentions a passage about phytoplasma strains and conflicting results. Specifically, the passage says: "Fast multiplication rates and high concentration of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains have been reported in young developing leaves and roots of infected daisy plants (Wei et al., 2004; Saracco et al., 2006), although conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima @@CITATION@@."

I notice that the citation is part of a discussion about conflicting results. The authors mention that two studies show certain findings, but another study describes conflicting results for a different phytoplasma. This indicates they are comparing the cited works with each other.

Next, looking at the general intent, the citation is being used to highlight conflicting results between two studies. This falls under a comparative context where the goal is to contrast two pieces of research.

Now, mapping this to the predefined rhetorical classes, CoCoXY is defined as a comparison of explanations or claims between two cited studies without involving the citing paper. In this case, the citation is used to point out conflicting results between Wei et al., 2004 and Saracco et al., 2006, which directly aligns with CoCoXY.

Therefore, after this analysis, the appropriate label for this citation is CoCoXY.
