Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in the given context. Let's go through the steps.

First, I extract the context around the citation. The sentence is about the hardening of the epicuticular wax layer, and it's mentioned that this hardening is due to oxidative mechanisms, citing @@CITATION@@.

Looking at the general intent, this seems to be supporting the current work's findings. The authors are agreeing with previous research that oxidative mechanisms are responsible for the wax hardening.

Now, choosing the rhetorical class: since it's supporting their own work by referring to prior research, it would be under Support. It's not a comparison, nor motivation or a method usage. The citation is confirming their results.

Step 1: The context states that the hardening of the epicuticular wax layer is due to oxidative mechanisms, citing the study as supporting this conclusion.

Step 2: The intent is to support the current findings by referencing prior research.

Step 3: The specific class is Support.

**Answer:** Support
