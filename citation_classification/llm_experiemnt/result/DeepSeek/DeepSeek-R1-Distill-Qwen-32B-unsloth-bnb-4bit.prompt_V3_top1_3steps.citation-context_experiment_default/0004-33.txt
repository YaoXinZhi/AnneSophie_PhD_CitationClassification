Okay, let's tackle this classification task. The citation in question is tagged as @@CITATION@@, and I need to assign the correct rhetorical class to it. First, I need to carefully analyze the context provided.

Looking at the passage, it mentions that the citation is used to show conflicting results. There's a comparison between two studies, with one reporting findings about plant health and another contradicting those results. That makes me think about the types of comparisons in the predefined classes.

I recall that CoCoXY specifically deals with comparing explanations or claims between two cited works, not necessarily with the citing paper. In this case, the passage is contrasting results from two different studies, so it's about how the cited works compare to each other regarding their findings or explanations.

On the other hand, CoCoRes is about comparing results between the citing paper and another work, but here it's more about two other studies conflicting. So CoCoXY seems more appropriate.

I should make sure there's no overlap with other classes like Motivation or Support. The passage isn't just supporting or motivating; it's highlighting a discrepancy, which is a form of comparison between the studies themselves.

Therefore, the rhetorical class for this citation is CoCoXY.
