Okay, I need to classify the citation in the given passage. Let me start by extracting the context.

The passage says, "We compared the results of our study with those of @@CITATION@@ and found significant discrepancies in the observed outcomes." 

Hmm, so the context is comparing the results of their study with another. 

The general intent here is Comparative because they're directly comparing their results. 

Now, looking at the classes, there's CoCoRes for comparing results of the cited work with the citing paper. That seems to fit exactly here since they're contrasting their findings.

So the rhetorical class should be CoCoRes.

CoCoRes
