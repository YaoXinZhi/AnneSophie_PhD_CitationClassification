Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to classify this citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific article passage. Let's go through the steps.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the citation discusses the use of magnetic water treatment devices in the USA, noting their spread since 1975. It doesn't add any further analysis or opinion beyond stating this fact.

Next, I should identify the general intent. The passage is simply describing a factual situation without using the citation to support, compare, or criticize anything. It's just providing background information.

Now, looking at the predefined classes, this seems to fit under "Neutral" because the citation is used descriptively without any supporting, comparing, motivating, or critical intent. It's purely informational.
