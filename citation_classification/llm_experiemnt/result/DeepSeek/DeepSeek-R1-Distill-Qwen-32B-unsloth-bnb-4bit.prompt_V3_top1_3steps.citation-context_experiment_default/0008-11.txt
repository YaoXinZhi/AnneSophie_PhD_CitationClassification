Okay, I need to determine the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I extract the context of the citation. The passage says: "Our previous research @@CITATION@@ has shown that the formation of the hard calcite scale on the surfaces exposed to hard water can be successfully prevented with the applied magnetic field." 

Next, I identify the general intent. The sentence is referring to earlier work that established the effectiveness of magnetic fields in preventing calcite scale. This seems to be justifying the current research by pointing out a knowledge gap or previous finding, which aligns with 'Motivation'.

Now, looking at the definitions, 'Motivation' is when the citation justifies why the current research is being conducted. In this case, the previous finding shows success, prompting the need to understand the mechanism, which is the motivation for the current study.

So, the specific rhetorical class here is 'Motivation'.

Step 1: The context is about previous research showing prevention of calcite scale with magnetic fields, prompting a study to understand the mechanism.

Step 2: The intent is to justify the current research by identifying a knowledge gap, which is motivational.

Step 3: The rhetorical class is 'Motivation'.
