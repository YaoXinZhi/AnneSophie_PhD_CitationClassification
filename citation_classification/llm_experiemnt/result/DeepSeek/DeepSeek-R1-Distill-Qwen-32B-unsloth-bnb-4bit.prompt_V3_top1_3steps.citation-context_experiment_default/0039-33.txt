Alright, so I need to determine the rhetorical class of the citation in the provided passage. First, I should extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the citation supports the current findings on the impact of host plants on bacterial community assembly. Specifically, it refers to cross-taxon investigations in fleas and ticks where the host influenced bacterial assemblages. 

Next, I'll identify the general intent. The citation is used to back up the current study's results, which points towards a supportive intent. 

Looking at the specific classes, "Support" is for when the citation confirms the current work's findings. In this case, the example aligns perfectly because the cited work shows similar patterns, thereby supporting the current research.

So, the most appropriate rhetorical class is "Support".

The citation is used to confirm and support the current findings by referencing similar results from other studies. 

**Support**
