Alright, let's break this down step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the citation @@CITATION@@. The passage mentions that researchers used a similar magnetic treatment method as a previous study and built upon it by adding another method. So the context is about building on existing research.

Next, I identify the general intent. The citation is being used to show that the current work builds upon previous research, which suggests a foundation for their new method. This points towards the 'Basis' category.

Now, looking at the predefined rhetorical classes, 'Basis' is intended for citations that serve as the intellectual foundation for the current study. This fits since the cited work provided the initial method that the current research expanded upon. Other options like 'CoCoGM' or 'Support' don't fit as well because the citation isn't comparing methods or supporting findings, but rather establishing a foundation.

The citation @@CITATION@@ is used to establish the foundational method upon which the current study builds.
