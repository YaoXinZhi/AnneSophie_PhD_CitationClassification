Okay, so I need to determine the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let's start by understanding the context.

The passage is: "The effect of plant growth regulators on root development was first studied by @@CITATION@@. This foundational work demonstrated that auxins significantly influence root elongation."

Step 1: Extract the context. The context is about studying the effect of plant growth regulators on root development. The citation refers to the first study by the author(s) on auxins influencing root elongation.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation is about foundational work that introduced the concept, so it seems to be a foundational basis for the current research.

Step 3: Choose the specific label. Looking at the definitions, "Basis" is when the citation references the intellectual foundation. Since this is the first study introducing the concept, it's the basis.

So, the rhetorical class should be "Basis."
