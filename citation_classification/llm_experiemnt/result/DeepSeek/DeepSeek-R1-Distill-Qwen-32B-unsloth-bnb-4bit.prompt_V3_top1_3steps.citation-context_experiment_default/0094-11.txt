Okay, I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@. Let me start by looking at the context provided. 

The context is: "This experiment was conducted to test the effectiveness of new pesticides @@CITATION@@. Previous studies have shown that conventional pesticides reduce pest populations by 50% on average."

Step 1 is to extract the context. The sentence mentions that the experiment's effectiveness is being tested, and previous studies show conventional pesticides reduce pests by 50%. The citation is tagging the part about previous studies, so the context is about how new pesticides compare to conventional ones.

Step 2 is to identify the general intent. The citation is comparing the effectiveness of new pesticides with conventional ones. That sounds like a comparative intent.

Step 3 is selecting the specific rhetorical class. The examples under CoCoRes are about comparing results. Since the previous studies' results (50% reduction) are being contrasted with the new study's findings, it's a direct comparison of results, so CoCoRes is the right choice.

So the label should be CoCoRes.
