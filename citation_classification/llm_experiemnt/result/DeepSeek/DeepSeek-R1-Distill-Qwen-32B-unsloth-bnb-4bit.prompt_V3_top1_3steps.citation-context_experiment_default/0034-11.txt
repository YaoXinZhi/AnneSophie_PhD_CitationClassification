Alright, so I'm trying to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me go through the steps carefully.

First, looking at the context provided: "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@." My task is to understand the intent behind this citation.

Breaking it down, the sentence is a factual statement about the spread of magnetic water treatment devices in the USA starting from 1975. The citation is included here to back up this statement. Since it's a neutral statement presenting a fact without any comparison, motivation, or critique, it seems like the citation is just providing information without any specific argument or critique.

Looking at the predefined classes, the 'Neutral' category fits here. The citation is used descriptively to support the statement without indicating any support, comparison, or motivation. It's simply stating a fact and providing a reference for it.

So, the rhetorical class for this should be 'Neutral'.
