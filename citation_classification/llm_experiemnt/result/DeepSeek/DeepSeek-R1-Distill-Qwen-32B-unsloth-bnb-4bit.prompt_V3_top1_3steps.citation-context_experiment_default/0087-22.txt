Okay, I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me read the passage again: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." 

Looking at the context, the sentence is talking about an experimental setup. They mention that the details were described in a previous work. So, the citation is referring to a method or setup used in a past study.

Now, according to the definitions, the Usage class is when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup from the cited work that is directly used in the current study. In this case, they're citing a previous detailed description of their setup, which suggests they're using that method in their current work.

There's no indication that they're comparing, supporting, motivating, or criticizing the cited work. It's more about acknowledging the source of their methodology.

So, I think the appropriate class here is Usage because they're referencing the previous study's experimental setup which they're using in their current research.
