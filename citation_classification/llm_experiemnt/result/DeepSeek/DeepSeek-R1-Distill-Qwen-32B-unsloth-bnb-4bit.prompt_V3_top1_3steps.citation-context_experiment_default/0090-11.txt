Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I'll look at the context. The passage is: "Plant pathogenic bacteria often manipulate host plant cells to form specialized infection structures, such as the so-called 'bacterial ooze' observed in Xylella fastidiosa infections @@CITATION@@." The citation is talking about how plant pathogenic bacteria create infection structures, specifically mentioning 'bacterial ooze' in Xylella fastidiosa.

Next, I need to determine the general intent of this citation. The sentence seems to provide support or confirmation about the infection structures. It's explaining a known phenomenon, so it's likely supporting the current work's assertion about bacterial manipulation.

Looking at the predefined classes, the citation isn't comparing methods or results with another study, so it's not CoCoGM or CoCoRes. It's also not introducing a new method or pointing out a weakness. The purpose here is to confirm or support the statement with an existing finding. 

So, the most appropriate class would be "Support" because it's used to back up the claim about bacterial infection structures.

The citation supports the assertion about bacterial infection structures.
