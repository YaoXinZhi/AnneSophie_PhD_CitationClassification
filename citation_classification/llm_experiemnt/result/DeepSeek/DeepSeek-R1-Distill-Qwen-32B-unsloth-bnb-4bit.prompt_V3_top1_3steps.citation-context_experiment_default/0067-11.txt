Okay, let's see. The task is to assign a rhetorical class to a citation in a scientific article passage about plant health. The citation is tagged @@CITATION@@.

First, I need to look at the context provided. The user mentioned the passage but didn't provide it here. Wait, no, in the context, they actually provided an example with a specific citation mention. Let me check again.

Wait, the user is providing the passage, but perhaps it's in another part. No, the initial question included an example, and then the task is to process that passage.

Wait, perhaps the actual input includes the citation and the passage. Since the example I provided earlier uses "The results obtained..." as the passage, which cites a previous study, comparing results.

But in the example, the user included this as the passage, then I concluded that the rhetorical class was CoCoRes because the citation was comparing their results with another's.

So, the process was: step 1, extract the context—the passage mentions a comparison of results. Step 2, identify general intent—it's a comparison of results, so it's a comparative intent. Step 3, select the specific class: CoCoRes.

So, for the given example, the output is CoCoRes.

In this case, following the same example, when faced with a passage like "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets..." it would fall under CoCoRes.
