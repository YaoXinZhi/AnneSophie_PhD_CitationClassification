Alright, I need to determine the rhetorical class of the citation @@CITATION@@. First, I extract the context where the citation is used. The passage mentions that the work reports on the occurrence of the virus in two new hosts, which is similar to the research being presented. 

Next, I identify the intent. The citation is used to show similarity between the cited work and the current study. It's pointing out that both studies found the virus in different hosts, indicating a similar pattern or finding.

Finally, I select the rhetorical class. Since the citation highlights a similarity in findings, the appropriate label is 'Similar'.
