Alright, let me go through the process step by step as per the user's instructions. 

First, I need to extract the context surrounding the citation @@CITATION@@. The passage provided is about the application of magnetic water treatment in preventing scale formation, referencing a previous study by the same authors. The key points here are that the citation discusses the prevention of scale using magnetic fields and mentions that the mechanism isn't yet explained, which is the focus of the current work.

Next, I should determine the general intent of this citation. The passage uses the citation to explain why the current research is being conductedâ€”because the previous study showed success in prevention but didn't explain the mechanism. This points towards the citation serving a motivational purpose, providing the rationale for the current study.

Finally, selecting the most appropriate rhetorical class. Since the citation is used to justify the current research by highlighting a knowledge gap, the correct label is "Motivation."

Step 1: Extracting the context, the citation discusses previous research on magnetic field application in preventing scale formation, indicating a knowledge gap that the current work aims to address.

Step 2: The general intent is motivational, as it identifies a need for further research.

Step 3: The specific rhetorical class is "Motivation."
