Okay, I'm trying to help classify the citation in the given passage. Let's go through the process step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The user provided a sample where the citation is marked with @@CITATION@@. The surrounding text mentions that they are discussing the multiplication rates and conflicting results. So the context is about comparing conflicting findings from different studies.

Next, I need to identify the general intent of the citation. The passage is talking about conflicting results between studies, which suggests a comparative intent. The citation is used to contrast the findings of two studies regarding phytoplasma in different hosts.

Now, mapping this to the predefined classes. The options under comparative include CoCoGM, CoCoRes, and CoCoXY. CoCoRes is about comparing results or findings. In this case, the citation is comparing the results of different experiments, so CoCoRes seems appropriate. It's not just about methods or explanations, but directly about the results differing.

The passage discusses conflicting results between studies, using the citation to compare findings. This fits under CoCoRes, focusing on the comparison of results.

CoCoRes
