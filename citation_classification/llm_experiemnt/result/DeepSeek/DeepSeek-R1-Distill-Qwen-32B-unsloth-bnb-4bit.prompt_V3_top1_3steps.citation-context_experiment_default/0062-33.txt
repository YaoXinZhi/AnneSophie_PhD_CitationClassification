Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me go through the process step by step.

First, I need to extract the context discussing the citation. The passage mentions that the hard calcite scale on surfaces exposed to hard water can be prevented with a magnetic field. It references the previous research done by @@CITATION@@, which found that the formation of this scale can be prevented using magnetic treatment. The current research aims to understand the mechanism behind this beneficial influence.

So, the general intent here is to provide a reason or justification for conducting the current research. The citation is pointing out a previous finding that hasn't been fully explained, thus creating a knowledge gap that the current study aims to fill.

Looking at the predefined classes, the Motivation category fits because the citation is used to justify the current research by highlighting a gap or an open question that needs addressing.

I don't think it's Basis because it's not directly establishing the intellectual foundation but rather identifying a need for further investigation. It's not a comparison (CoCo) nor is it supporting, using, or criticizing the cited work. It's more about why this research is important now.

In this context, the citation is used to identify a knowledge gap and justify the current research. The study by @@CITATION@@ showed prevention of scale formation but didn't explain the mechanism, motivating the current work to explore this.
