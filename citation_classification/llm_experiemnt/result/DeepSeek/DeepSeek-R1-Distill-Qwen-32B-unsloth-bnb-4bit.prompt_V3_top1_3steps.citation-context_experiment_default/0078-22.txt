Alright, I need to determine the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let's start by carefully extracting the context. The passage mentions that studies have found an increase in disease severity when the pathogen is transmitted from a wild-type host compared to a mutant. It then refers to a specific citation that discusses how the pathogen's population is bottlenecked in the mutant host but not in the WT hosts.

Now, the general intent here seems to be that the citation is supporting a finding. The current study is explaining the mechanism of disease severity by citing previous work that looked into population bottlenecks. Since the citation is being used to confirm or corroborate the current study's findings, it's likely in the support category.

Looking at the definitions, Support is when the citation confirms or supports the work of the citing authors. The example given in the Support definition aligns with this scenario, where previous research is used to back up the current study's conclusions. Therefore, the rhetorical class should be Support.

The citation is used to support the current study's findings by referencing prior research on pathogen population bottlenecks.
