Alright, I'm trying to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. First, I'll read the passage to understand the context surrounding the citation.

The passage mentions studies by Wei et al. and Saracco et al. about the phytoplasmas in different plants. It states that they reported fast multiplication rates and high concentration in young leaves and roots, but also notes conflicting results for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in another plant.

Looking at the context, the citation is used to compare the findings of these two studies. The authors point out that while Wei et al. reported high concentrations, Saracco et al. found conflicting results. This is a comparison between two cited studies, specifically their results regarding the same type of organism but in different hosts.

According to the definitions, CoCoXY is used when comparing two cited studies with each other, not with the citing paper. Since the passage is contrasting the results of Wei et al. and Saracco et al., the appropriate class is CoCoXY.
