Okay, I'm trying to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific article passage. The task is to determine the appropriate rhetorical class from the predefined list: Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Motivation, Future, Support, Similar, Usage, Weakness, Neutral.

First, I need to extract the context of the citation. The user provided the passage, but it's important to focus on the surrounding text to understand how the citation is being used.

In this case, the passage mentions that the citation supports the finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly. The authors reference the cited work to back up their own results. The key words here are "supported by" and the mention of similar findings in other studies.

Next, I identify the general intent of the citation. The authors are using the citation to confirm or endorse their findings, which suggests a supportive intent. They are not comparing methodologies or results, nor are they pointing out weaknesses or future directions.

Looking at the predefined classes, Support is the category where the citation is used to confirm or back up the current work's findings. The example given for Support is very similar: citing previous research that aligns with the current findings.

So, putting it all together, the citation is being used to support the current study's results by referencing previous similar findings. Therefore, the most appropriate rhetorical class is Support.
