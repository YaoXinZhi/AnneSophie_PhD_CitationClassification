Okay, let's tackle this classification task step by step. First, I need to understand the context where the citation @@CITATION@@ is used. Looking at the passage provided, it's about research related to plant health, particularly discussing the multiplication rates and concentrations of certain phytoplasmas in infected daisy plants. The passage mentions conflicting results between two studies, citing both Wei et al., 2004 and another author. The key point here is the comparison of results from these studies.

Next, determining the general intent. The mention of conflicting results indicates that the authors are comparing findings from different studies. This leans toward a comparative rhetorical class.

Now, selecting the specific rhetorical class from the predefined list. The options under comparative are CoCoGM, CoCoRes, and CoCoXY. Since the citation is comparing results from two other studies without involving the current paper's findings, it fits into CoCoXY, which involves comparing explanations or claims between cited works.
