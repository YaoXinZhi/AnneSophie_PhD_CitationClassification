Alright, I need to determine the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the provided passage. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the hard calcite scale can be prevented with a magnetic field but doesn't explain how. The current work aims to understand this mechanism, referencing their previous research. 

Next, I'll identify the general intent. The citation is used to point out a knowledge gapâ€”specifically, that while previous work showed prevention, the mechanism wasn't explained. This is used to justify the current research's motivation.

Finally, selecting the specific class. Since the citation is highlighting a gap that motivates the current study, the appropriate class is Motivation.
