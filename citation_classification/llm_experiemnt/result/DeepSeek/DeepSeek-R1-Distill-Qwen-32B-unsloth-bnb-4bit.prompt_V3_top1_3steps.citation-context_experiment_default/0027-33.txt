Alright, let's walk through this step by step. First, I need to understand the task. The goal is to classify a citation in a scientific article passage into one of 11 predefined rhetorical classes. The user has provided a detailed context, definitions, and examples for each class. 

Step 1: Extract the context discussing the citation @@CITATION@@. I need to identify the exact part of the passage that refers to the citation and focus on the semantic context that helps determine the intent.

Looking at the example, the citation is embedded within a sentence that discusses the multiplication rates and conflicting results in different plant species. The passage mentions studies by Wei et al. and Saracco et al. and then contrasts them with conflicting results from another study via @@CITATION@@.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The context uses the citation to compare conflicting results from different studies. This indicates a comparative intent, particularly comparing the explanations or claims of two cited studies.

Step 3: Select the specific rhetorical class. The predefined classes for comparison are CoCoGM, CoCoRes, and CoCoXY. Since the citation is comparing two studies with conflicting results, it falls under CoCoXY, which is used when comparing or contrasting two cited studies with each other, not with the citing paper.
