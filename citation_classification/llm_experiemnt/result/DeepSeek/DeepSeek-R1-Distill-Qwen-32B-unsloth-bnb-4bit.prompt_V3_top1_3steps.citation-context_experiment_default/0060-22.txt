Okay, I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in this passage. Let me start by breaking down the steps as instructed.

First, I need to extract the context surrounding the @@CITATION@@. The passage is about plant host responses to infection, and the citation is in the middle, mentioning a study by @@CITATION@@ that found conflicting results. The authors then compare their own results with those cited.

Next, I should identify the general intent. They're discussing other studies' findings to either support or contrast their own results. Since they mention conflicting results, it's a comparison, so it's likely a comparative intent.

Now, mapping to the specific rhetorical classes under Comparative, the options are CoCoGM, CoCoRes, and CoCoXY. Since the citation is being compared to another study, not directly to their own results, it falls under CoCoXY. They're comparing two cited studies' explanations or claims to show conflict.

So putting it all together, the most appropriate label is CoCoXY because they're comparing two cited works to highlight conflicting results.
</think>

The citation is comparing two studies (Wei et al., 2004 and Saracco et al., 2006) with each other, highlighting conflicting results. This is an example of CoCoXY, as it compares the explanations or claims of two cited works without directly comparing them to the citing paper's findings.

**Answer:** CoCoXY
