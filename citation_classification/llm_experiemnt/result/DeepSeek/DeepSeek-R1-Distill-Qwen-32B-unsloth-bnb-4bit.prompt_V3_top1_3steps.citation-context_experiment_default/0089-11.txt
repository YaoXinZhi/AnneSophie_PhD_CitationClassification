Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to classify the citation in the given passage. The task is to assign one of the predefined rhetorical classes to the citation marked @@CITATION@@. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. Looking at the provided passage, it's talking about the multiplication rates and conflicting results of a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima. Two studies are mentioned: Wei et al., 2004 and Saracco et al., 2006, but the citation in question is the one referring to the conflicting results described by another group.

So the context is about conflicting results between studies on phytoplasma in a specific plant. The passage uses the citation to point out that while some studies report high multiplication rates, others describe conflicting results.

Next, I need to identify the general intent of this citation. It seems like the citation is being used to compare or contrast two cited studies with each other, not directly with the current paper. The mention of conflicting results suggests that the authors are highlighting a discrepancy between two pieces of research. This fits into a comparative category.

Looking at the predefined classes, CoCoXY is for comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies. Here, the citation is pointing out that conflicting results exist between studies, which is a comparison between the cited works themselves rather than the current paper.

So, the rhetorical class should be CoCoXY because it's comparing the results of different studies to show inconsistency.

The citation is comparing conflicting results from different studies, indicating a comparison of explanations or findings between them.

CoCoXY
