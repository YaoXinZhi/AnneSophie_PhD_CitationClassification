Alright, I need to determine the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@. First, I'll extract the context where the citation is used. The passage says, "Recent studies have highlighted the potential of biochar as a sustainable agricultural amendment @@CITATION@@." 

Next, I look at the general intent. The citation is referenced to justify the use of biochar, indicating a motivation for why the current research is being conducted. It points out the significance of biochar based on previous findings, aiming to fill a gap or continue from where earlier studies left off.

Now, assigning the specific class. Since the citation is used to support the reasoning behind the current research and highlight why it's important, the appropriate label is "Motivation."
