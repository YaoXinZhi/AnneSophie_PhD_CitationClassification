Okay, so I need to classify the citation in the given passage. Let's start by understanding the context of the citation. The passage mentions that a study by @@CITATION@@ found 18 species of pear flies in different regions, specifically in the northwest and northeast of China. The citing paper then states that their comprehensive sampling led to the discovery of 27 species across similar regions and suggests that the previous work might have underestimated the diversity due to limited sampling.

Step 1: The context is that the current study compared their findings (27 species) with the previous study (18 species) and concluded that the earlier work's estimates were lower. They are using the citation to set up a comparison, pointing out a difference in results.

Step 2: General intent seems to be Comparative. Looking at the options, it could be CoCoRes since they're comparing results. There's a direct mention of different numbers found, indicating a contrast in findings.

Step 3: The specific class should be CoCoRes because they're directly comparing the results of their study with the cited one, highlighting the difference in the number of species identified.
