Okay, so I'm trying to determine the rhetorical class of the citation in the given scientific passage. Let me go through the process step by step.

First, I need to look at the context provided. The passage mentions a study where authors observed that the number of plant-parasitic nematodes in the soil around a specific tree species was lower than a control group. They cite this study as evidence for the effectiveness of using this tree species for suppressing nematodes.

Now, the key here is to understand why they are citing this study. The main intent seems to be supporting their own findings or claims. The sentence before the citation sets up the idea that they observed fewer nematodes and then back it up with the cited study. So the citation is being used to provide confirmation or backing for their observation.

Next, I should consider the possible rhetorical classes. The options that come to mind are "Support" and "Similar." "Support" is when the citation is used to confirm or back up the citing authors' work. "Similar" is when the cited work is shown to have similar results or observations.

In this case, the authors are not just saying that another study found similar results but are specifically using it to support their own finding. They're presenting their observation and then citing a study that demonstrates the effectiveness, which reinforces their point. This leans more towards "Support" because they are using the citation to back up their own claim, rather than just noting that another study found similar findings.

So, putting it all together, the citation is used to support the authors' assertion about the effectiveness of the tree species in suppressing nematodes. Therefore, the rhetorical class is "Support."

Step 1: The cited study supports the assertion about the effectiveness of a tree species in suppressing plant-parasitic nematodes.

Step 2: The intent is to confirm or back up the current paper's findings, indicating a supportive use of the citation.

Step 3: The citation is used to support the authors' work, so the label is Support.

{
  "label": "Support"
