Alright, I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given paragraph. Let me start by reading the context carefully.

The context is about plant disease detection using machine learning models. It first mentions existing reviews that cover various ML techniques in agriculture, but then points out that @@CITATION@@ specifically focuses on plant disease detection using deep learning models. The passage also states that @@CITATION@@ provides a comprehensive review, which helps in understanding the current status and challenges in plant disease monitoring.

So, the context discusses how @@CITATION@@ is a specific example within a broader category. It's being cited to highlight that while there are general reviews, this one is more targeted. This suggests that the citation is used to support the argument by showing that previous work has addressed plant disease detection in depth.

Looking at the definitions, the Support class is when the citation is used to confirm or back up the current work's findings or statements. In this case, the citation is supporting by indicating that there's a solid body of work in deep learning for plant disease detection, which reinforces the current study's focus.

I don't see any comparison happening here, just an affirmation that this area has been researched. It's not pointing out a gap or future direction, so Motivation or Future don't fit. It's not a usage of a method or a critique either. Therefore, the most appropriate class is Support.
