Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the task is to determine the rhetorical class of a citation in a scientific article passage. The user has given a specific citation, @@CITATION@@, and wants me to classify it into one of the predefined categories based on the context provided.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. That's Step 1. The context given here is: "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@@."

So, the sentence is talking about findings regarding how insect hosts affect bacterial communities. They mention that their findings are supported by recent cross-taxon investigations, including the cited work. The cited work apparently found that in fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages, while other factors didn't play a role.

Now, moving to Step 2: Identify the general intent of the citation. The general intent here seems to be that the cited work supports the current authors' findings. They're using the citation to back up their own results, indicating a supportive intent.

Step 3 is to map this to the specific rhetorical class. Looking at the definitions, Support is when the citation is used to confirm the citing authors' work. The example given under Support is exactly this kind of scenario. They mention that their finding is supported by the cited work, which matches the 'Support' class.

So, putting it all together, the citation is used to support the authors' findings, hence the rhetorical class is Support.

The context discusses how the authors' findings are supported by the cited work, indicating the citation is used to confirm their results.
