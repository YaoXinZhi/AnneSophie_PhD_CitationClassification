Alright, so I'm faced with a task where I need to classify a citation in a scientific article into a specific rhetorical class. The citation in question is @@CITATION@@ and it's part of a passage that mentions a study by Gherlenda et al. (2022) on the effects of a specific compound, BmKN-2, on the American dog tick, D. variabilis. The passage states that Gherlenda et al. found that this compound caused morphological changes in the tick's eggs, resulting in hatching failure.

Step 1: Extract context. The context is that the current paper is discussing their own findings about BmKN-2 on R. sanguineus ticks, and they mention a prior study by Gherlenda et al. showing similar effects on a different tick species. So, the citation is being used to show that their results are consistent with another study.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. This seems like the citation is providing support or confirmation for the current findings. The authors are pointing out that their results are similar to another study, which adds credibility.

Step 3: Assign the rhetorical class. Looking at the definitions, Support is when the citation confirms or supports the current work's findings. Here, Gherlenda et al.'s results support the current study's conclusion that BmKN-2 affects tick egg hatching. So, the appropriate label is Support.
