Okay, I need to determine the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific article passage. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the study by @@CITATION@@ showed fast multiplication rates and high concentration of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains in young leaves and roots, but conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima. 

Next, I identify the general intent. The citation is comparing two studies: one where the strains showed high concentration and another with conflicting results. So, it's comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies.

Looking at the predefined classes, CoCoXY fits here because it involves comparing two studies without referencing the current paper. 

Thus, the rhetorical class is CoCoXY.
