Okay, I need to classify the usage of the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific passage within the plant health domain. 

First, I should extract the context around the citation. Looking at the passage provided, the citation is part of a discussion about the impact of plant hosts on bacterial community assembly. The sentence mentions that their findings are supported by recent studies on other insect-associated bacteria, specifically citing the example of fleas and ticks where the arthropod host governs bacterial assemblages.

Now, I need to determine the general intent of the citation. The authors are using the cited work to back up their own findings, indicating that their results are consistent with previous research. This suggests a supportive role for the citation.

Next, considering the predefined rhetorical classes, the most appropriate label here is 'Support'. This is because the citation is being used to confirm or back up the current paper's findings, showing that similar results have been observed in other studies, thereby strengthening the validity of their work.

Step 1: The context mentions that the citation supports findings on how arthropod hosts govern bacterial assemblages, similar to their study.

Step 2: The intent is to support the current research findings with previous studies.

Step 3: The specific class is Support.
