Okay, so I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. Let me go through the process step by step.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that researchers are examining the genetic basis of host specificity in plant-parasitic nematodes. They found that genes related to host recognition are expressed at higher levels compared to other developmental stages. They reference a study by Gheysen et al., which looked at similar processes in other organisms. Gheysen et al. identified candidate genes involved in recognition and pathogenicity by comparing gene expression profiles.

So, the context shows that the current study is pointing out a similarity between their findings and the previous study. Both studies involved looking into gene expression related to host recognition or pathogenicity.

Next, I need to identify the general intent of the citation. The citation is pointing out a similarity in the methodology or findings between their work and the cited paper. They are showing that both used similar approaches to identify genes related to host recognition.

Finally, looking at the predefined classes, this falls under "Similar," which is when the citation is used to highlight a similarity between the cited work and the current study's findings or methods.
