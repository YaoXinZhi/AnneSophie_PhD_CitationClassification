Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to assign the correct rhetorical class label for a citation in a scientific article passage about plant health. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The user provided this passage: "For instance, in wheat, the application of chitosan has been found to not only improve root development but also enhance the photosynthetic activity of plants @@CITATION@@."

So, the context is about chitosan application in wheat improving root development and photosynthesis. The citation is used here to support these findings.

Next, I need to identify the general intent. The citation is supporting the current research's findings. The study cited shows that chitosan improved root development and photosynthesis, which matches the current paper's results. So, it's a supportive intent.

Now, looking at the specific rhetorical classes, I remember that "Support" is when the citation is used to confirm or back up the current work's findings. In this case, the cited paper's results are used as evidence for the same outcomes in the current study. There's no comparison, motivation, or criticism here. It's straightforward support.

So, the most appropriate label would be "Support."

Step-by-step explanation:

Step 1: The context shows that the citation supports findings about chitosan in wheat plants.

Step 2: The citation is used to confirm the current research's results, indicating a supportive intent.

Step 3: The specific label is "Support" because it confirms the cited work's findings.

The label is: Support
