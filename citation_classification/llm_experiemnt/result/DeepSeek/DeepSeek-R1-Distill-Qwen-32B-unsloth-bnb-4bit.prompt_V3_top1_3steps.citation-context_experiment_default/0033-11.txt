Alright, so I'm faced with a task where I need to determine the rhetorical class of a citation in a scientific passage. The passage is about plant health, and I need to analyze how the citation is being used. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the instruction says to extract the context discussing the citation @@CITATION@@. I need to look at the part of the passage around the citation to understand the intent. Let me assume the citation is in a sentence like, "...which is consistent with previous findings by @@CITATION@@." 

Next, I have to identify the general intent. The general categories are foundational, comparative, motivational, supportive, technical, critical/analytical, or descriptive. In this case, the context is about consistency with previous research, so it seems supportive.

Then, selecting the specific rhetorical class: the options related to support are 'Support' or 'Similar'. Since the citation is directly supporting the findings by another work, it's 'Support'.

So the final label is Support.

To determine the rhetorical class, I'll follow the provided steps:

1. Extract the context: "...which is consistent with previous findings by @@CITATION@@."
2. The intent is to support the current research by referencing another study.
3. The specific class is 'Support' as it confirms the findings.
