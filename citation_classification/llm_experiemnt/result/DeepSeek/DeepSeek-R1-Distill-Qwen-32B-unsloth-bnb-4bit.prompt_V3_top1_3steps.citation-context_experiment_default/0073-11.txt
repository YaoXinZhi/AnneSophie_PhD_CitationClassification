Alright, I'm trying to classify the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me go through the process step by step.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage says: "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@@."

Looking at this, the main point is that the authors' finding about insect hosts affecting bacterial communities is supported by another study. The use of "supported by" indicates that the cited work corroborates their results.

Next, I identify the general intent. Since the citation is used to confirm or back up the authors' findings, the intent is supportive. This points towards the 'Support' class.

Now, looking at the predefined classes, 'Support' fits because the citation is confirming the authors' results. The example given for 'Support' also involves citing previous research to back up findings, which aligns with what's happening here.

The context involves citing a study to support the authors' findings, indicating the citation is used for support.

**Step-by-step explanation:**

1. **Extract Context:** The citation is used to support the authors' findings about insect hosts affecting bacterial community assembly, referencing another study's results.
2. **Identify Intent:** The intent is to support the current research with existing findings.
3. **Select Class:** The rhetorical class is 'Support'.
