Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in this plant health passage. Let me break this down step by step as per the guide.

First, I need to extract the context discussing the citation @@CITATION@@. Looking at the passage, it's talking about the multiplication rates and conflicting results of a study on a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima. The example given is from two studies: Wei et al. (2004) and Saracco et al. (2006). They mention that conflicting results were described in this citation.

Next, I need to determine the general intent of the citation. The context discusses two studies that have conflicting findings. The current paper is pointing out that while some studies report high multiplication rates, others describe conflicting results. So the citation isn't directly supporting or opposing; it's showing a comparison between different studies' explanations or claims.

Looking at the predefined classes, CoCoXY is for when the citation is used to compare or contrast two cited studies with each other, not with the citing paper. Since the passage is comparing results from two different studies about conflicting findings, that fits into CoCoXY.

So the rhetorical class should be CoCoXY.
