Okay, I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me first read the passage carefully to understand the context and what the citation is referring to. 

The passage mentions studying the behavior of beneficial insects in greenhouses and cites a study by Smith et al. (2022). The focus is on how these insects' behavior is influenced by environmental factors like temperature and humidity. 

From the context, the citation is providing foundational information about the research that was conducted on these insects. It seems to introduce and validate the methods or observations that the current study is building upon. 

Looking at the predefined classes, "Basis" refers to when the citation is the intellectual foundation of the current research. The example provided in the Basis class fits this scenario: citing a prior work that the current study is replicating or building upon. 

Comparing the passage to the Basis example, both introduce prior research that sets the stage for the current work. Therefore, the intent here is that the citation is serving as the foundation for the study being discussed.

So, the classification should be "Basis."

Step 1: Extract the context discussing the citation @@CITATION@@. The passage mentions studying the behavior of beneficial insects in greenhouses, specifically referring to a study by Smith et al. (2022) that examined the influence of environmental factors such as temperature and humidity on their behavior.

Step 2: Identify the general intent of the citation. The citation is introducing prior research that the current study builds upon. This suggests the citation is foundational.

Step 3: Map the general intent to the specific rhetorical class. Since the citation introduces prior research that the current study is based on, it falls under the "Basis" class.

"Basis"
