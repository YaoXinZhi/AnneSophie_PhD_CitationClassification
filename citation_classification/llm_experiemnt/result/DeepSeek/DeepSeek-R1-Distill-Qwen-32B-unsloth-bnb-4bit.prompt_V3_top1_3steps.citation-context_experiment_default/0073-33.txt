Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm given a task where I have to classify a citation in a scientific article into one of several predefined rhetorical classes. The passage provided is about the presence and effects of an invasive plant species, *Conyza canadensis*, in the Czech Republic. The citation here is referring to other studies that looked at the species composition in the same areas.

First, I need to extract the context of the citation. The main point is that previous studies in the same location found the invasive species, and the current study aims to understand its impact. The use of @@CITATION@@ here is to set the stage by referring to prior research.

Next, I should identify the general intent. It seems like the citation is pointing out that similar findings have been reported elsewhere, indicating a pattern. This falls under "Similar" because it's highlighting that other studies have shown the same presence, supporting the current observation without directly comparing methods or results.

So, the rhetorical class should be "Similar" because it's pointing out that other studies have found the same thing, which supports the current work's findings.

Similar

#Step 1: Extract the context discussing the citation @@CITATION@@. Keep only the semantic context useful to understand the intent of the citation @@CITATION@@.
The citation refers to studies that also found the invasive plant species *Conyza canadensis* in the same area. The context discusses the presence and effects of this species in the Czech Republic and refers to other studies.

#Step 2: Identify the general intent of the citation.
This is pointing out that other studies have also found the same invasive plant species, indicating similarity in findings.

#Step 3: Select the specific rhetorical class (final output label).
"Similar"
