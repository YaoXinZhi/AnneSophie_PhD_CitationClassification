Okay, so I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific passage into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The citation is within a sentence that mentions how the experimental setup was already described in detail. The authors are referring to their previous work as a basis for the current study's methodology. 

Next, I'll determine the general intent. They're using the citation to reference a prior method or setup, which is essential for their current research. This seems foundational because they're relying on established procedures.

Now, looking at the predefined classes, "Basis" is for citations that serve as the intellectual foundation, supporting the current work by referencing prior work. Since they're using the citation to explain their methodology, it fits under Basis. There's no comparison, support, or motivation hereâ€”it's purely about establishing the foundation of their method.

So, the appropriate class is Basis.

The citation is used to reference a prior method or setup, establishing the foundation for the current study's methodology.

Step-by-step explanation:
1. Extracted context: Citation refers to detailed description of experimental setup.
2. General intent: Establishing the intellectual foundation.
3. Rhetorical class: Basis.

Output:

Basis
