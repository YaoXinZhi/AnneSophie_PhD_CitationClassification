Okay, I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific passage. Let's start by extracting the context.

The passage says: "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@@."

Step 1: Extract the context. The context is about supporting the current finding with another study. The authors mention their finding and then say it's supported by another's work, specifically pointing out similarities in results.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation is used to confirm their finding, so it's supportive in nature. 

Step 3: Select the specific rhetorical class. The example given for "Support" is when the citation supports the current work. This case directly uses the citation to confirm their result about hosts affecting bacterial communities, so it falls under Support.
