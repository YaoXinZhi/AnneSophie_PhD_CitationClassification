Okay, I need to determine the rhetorical class for the citation in the given context. Let's go through the steps carefully.

First, I extract the context of the citation. The relevant sentence is: "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@@."

Now, I analyze the general intent. The citation is mentioned right after the authors state that their finding is supported by similar investigations. The context shows that their results align with those of others, thus it's providing support.

Looking at the predefined classes, "Support" is when the citation confirms or supports the current authors' work. The example given for Support is very similar to this case. The authors are pointing out that their findings are consistent with another study, which fits the Support category.

Double-checking, there's no comparison with other studies (so not CoCoRes or CoCoXY), no motivation or foundation being discussed, and no weakness or usage mentioned. It's purely about backing their results with another study's findings.

So, the correct label is "Support."

Step 1: The context highlights that the citation supports the current authors' findings about insect hosts affecting bacterial assembly.

Step 2: The intent is to support the current study's results with a similar finding from another work.

Step 3: The specific class is "Support."
