Alright, I need to assign a rhetorical class to the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific article passage related to plant health. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation to understand how it's being used. The passage discusses how certain insects can carry bacteria that infect plants. It mentions that some insects, like aphids, transmit bacteria that cause diseases in plants. The citation @@CITATION@@ is referenced here. 

Looking closely, the passage states that this study supports previous findings, indicating that insects play a role in spreading plant pathogens. The specific example given is that the citation supports the idea of insects moving plant pathogens to different locations.

Now, I need to determine the general intent of this citation. It seems like the authors are using the citation to back up their own findings, showing that their results align with prior research. This points towards a supportive intent.

Next, I'll match this to the predefined classes. The class that best fits is 'Support', as the citation is confirming or reinforcing the current study's results with evidence from previous work.
