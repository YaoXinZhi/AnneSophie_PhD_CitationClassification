Okay, so I need to figure out how to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. Let's start by breaking down the problem step by step.

First, I'll look at Step 1, which is to extract the context discussing the citation. The task mentions that I should keep only the semantic context useful for understanding the intent of the citation. Since there's no specific passage provided in the query, I might have to assume or create a hypothetical scenario based on the instructions given.

Step 2 involves identifying the general intent of the citation. The possible categories are Foundational, Comparative, Motivational, Supportive, Technical, Critical/Analytical, or Descriptive. Each of these corresponds to different rhetorical classes.

For example, if the citation is used to establish the foundation of the current research, it would fall under "Basis." If the authors are comparing their methods with another study, it might be "CoCoGM." If they're using the citation to support their findings, it could be "Support."

Step 3 is about selecting the specific rhetorical class. The predefined list includes labels like Basis, CoCoGM, etc. So, after determining the general intent, I need to map it to the most appropriate label.

In this case, since I don't have the actual passage, I might need to think about the most common scenario or perhaps take a sample from the definitions provided. For example, if the citation is used to support a finding, the label would be "Support."

Wait, but without the actual text, it's tricky. Maybe I can think of a common example. Suppose the passage says something like, "Our results confirm previous findings in @@CITATION@@." Here, the intent is to support, so the label would be "Support."

Alternatively, if the citation is used to compare methods, it would be "CoCoGM." If it's pointing out a limitation in prior work, "Weakness" would be appropriate.

In the absence of specific details, it's challenging, but perhaps the best approach is to consider that the most common intent might be support or usage. But since I have to choose one, I'll go with "Support" as it's quite frequent in research papers when authors corroborate their findings with previous studies.

Now, putting it all together, if I had a passage where the citation is used to support the authors' findings, the step-by-step reasoning would lead me to select "Support" as the rhetorical class.
