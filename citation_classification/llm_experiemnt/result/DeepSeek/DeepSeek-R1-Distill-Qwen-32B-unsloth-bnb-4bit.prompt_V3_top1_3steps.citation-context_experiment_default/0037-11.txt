Okay, so I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me try to follow the steps outlined.

First, I'll look at the context provided in the passage. The passage says: "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@@."

So, the sentence mentions that their finding is "supported" by some investigations. The citation is pointing to other studies that provide evidence backing up their results. The context is definitely about supporting their own data with similar findings from other works.

Next, I'll determine the general intent. Since the citation is used to back up their findings, the intent is supportive. That narrows it down to either "Support" or maybe "Similar."

Looking at the definitions: "Support" is when the citation supports the current work's results. "Similar" is when they point out a similarity between cited and current work. Here, it's more about supporting, not just stating a similarity, so "Support" seems appropriate.

So, the classification should be "Support."
