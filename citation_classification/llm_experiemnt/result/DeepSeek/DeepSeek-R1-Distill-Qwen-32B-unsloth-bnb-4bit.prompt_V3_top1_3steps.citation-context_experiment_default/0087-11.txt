Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class of the citation @@CITATION@@ mentioned in the article passage about plant health. Let me break down the process step by step as per the instructions.

First, I'll look at the context provided. The passage discusses the use of magnetic fields to prevent hard calcite scale formation in hard water. The authors refer to their previous research (citation @@CITATION@@) which showed the effectiveness of magnetic treatment. However, they point out that the explanation behind this phenomenon is still not understood, which is why their current work aims to explore the mechanism.

Now, according to the task, I need to extract the context surrounding the citation. The key point here is that the authors are citing their own previous work to establish why they're conducting this new research. They're indicating that while the magnetic treatment works, the mechanism is unknown, hence the motivation behind their current study.

Next, I have to identify the general intent of the citation. Since the authors are using this citation to justify the need for their current research because there's a gap in understanding, this falls under the Motivational intent.

Looking at the predefined classes, the Motivation class is used when the citation justifies the current research by identifying a knowledge gap or need. This matches the context where the authors refer to their previous work to highlight the existing gap in understanding the mechanism, thus motivating their new study.

Therefore, the appropriate rhetorical class here is "Motivation."
</think>

The citation refers to the authors' previous work that showed the effectiveness of magnetic fields in preventing calcite scale, indicating a knowledge gap about the mechanism, thus motivating the current research.

**Step-by-step Explanation:**
1. Context: Citation points to past research showing effectiveness of magnetic treatment but notes the mechanism isn't understood.
2. Intent: The citation identifies a knowledge gap, motivating the current study.
3. Rhetorical Class: Motivation.
