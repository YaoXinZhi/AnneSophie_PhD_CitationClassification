Alright, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to classify a citation in a plant health scientific article into a specific rhetorical class. They provided a detailed context and a structured process to follow. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation @@CITATION@@. The passage given is about the distribution of plant-associated bacteria, with the citation mentioning specific findings. 

Next, I should identify the general intent of the citation. The passage uses the cited work to support the current findings, indicating a supportive intent.

Looking at the predefined classes, the appropriate category here is Support because the citation aligns with the current study's results, providing confirmation.

So, the final label should be "Support".

Step 1: Extract the context discussing the citation @@CITATION@@.  
The passage states: "Plant-associated bacteria exhibit a wide range of lifestyles, including mutualists, pathogens, and saprobes, which influence their distribution patterns across different plant species and environments @@CITATION@@."

Step 2: Identify the general intent of the citation.  
The citation is used to confirm or support the description of plant-associated bacteria's lifestyles and their influence on distribution patterns.

Step 3: Select the specific rhetorical class.  
The intent is supportive, as the citation is used to confirm the current discussion.
