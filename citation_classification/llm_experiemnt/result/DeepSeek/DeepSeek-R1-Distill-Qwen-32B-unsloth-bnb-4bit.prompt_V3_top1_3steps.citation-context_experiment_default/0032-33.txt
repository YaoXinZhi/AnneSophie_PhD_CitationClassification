Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the provided passage. Let me start by carefully reading the context. The passage says, "Plant pathologists have studied the effects of various environmental factors on plant diseases. For example, high humidity often increases disease severity @@CITATION@@. This study extends previous work by examining how temperature interacts with humidity in disease development."

Hmm, the citation is mentioned right after discussing high humidity increasing disease severity. Then, the study says it's extending previous work to look at temperature's role. So, the context is about extending existing research by adding a new variableâ€”temperature.

Next, I need to determine the general intent of the citation. The citation is supporting the background information about environmental factors affecting plant diseases. It's providing evidence that high humidity increases disease severity, which the current study builds upon.

In the predefined classes, "Support" refers to when a citation is used to back up the current work's claims or findings. Here, the citation is directly supporting the statement about high humidity's effect, which is a foundation for their study on temperature interaction.

So, the appropriate rhetorical class here would be "Support" because the citation is backing up the initial observation that the current research is based on.
</think>

The citation is used to support a background statement about environmental factors affecting plant diseases, which the current study builds upon. It provides foundational evidence for the study's premise.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**
1. The citation supports the statement that high humidity increases disease severity.
2. This support is part of the background leading into the study's focus on temperature interaction.
3. The general intent is supportive, as it underpins the current research's foundation.

**Answer:**
"Support"
