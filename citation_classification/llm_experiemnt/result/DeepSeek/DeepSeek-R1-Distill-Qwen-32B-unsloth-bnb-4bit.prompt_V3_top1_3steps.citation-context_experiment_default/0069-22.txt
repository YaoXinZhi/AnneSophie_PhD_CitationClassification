Okay, I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the passage into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. Let me go through the process step by step.

First, I'll extract the context surrounding the citation. The passage says that the citation reports a similar finding on the distribution of the bacteria in a different host plant. The main point is that the current study's findings align with those of the cited work.

Next, I need to identify the general intent of the citation. Since it's showing that another study found the same thing, this is about supporting the current work's findings. It's not foundational, motivational, or technicalâ€”it's directly supporting the results.

Looking at the definitions, the "Similar" class is when a citation points out a similarity in results or findings. The example provided supports this, as the cited work's findings are similar to the current study's. The authors are using the citation to show that their results are consistent with others, which falls under the Similar category.

I don't think it's Support because Support is more about confirming specific results rather than showing a similar pattern. It's more about a parallel finding. So, the best fit here is "Similar."
