Okay, let's go through the problem step by step. I need to classify a citation in a scientific article into one of several predefined rhetorical classes. The citation in question is @@CITATION@@ and the passage it's embedded in is:

"Historically, the impact of root exudates in the rhizosphere has been studied in the context of disease resistance (Bakker et al., 2007), but in recent years, attention has shifted toward the role of rhizosphere bacteria in promoting plant growth (Berg 2009; @@CITATION@@)."

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage discusses historical studies on root exudates and their impact on disease resistance, referencing Bakker et al., 2007, and then mentions a shift in attention towards the role of rhizosphere bacteria in promoting plant growth, citing Berg 2009 and the @@CITATION@@. The @@CITATION@@ seems to be part of a group of references, specifically alongside Berg 2009, discussing the role of rhizosphere bacteria.

Now, I'll identify the general intent of the citation. The sentence is pointing out a shift in focus from disease resistance to plant growth promotion by rhizosphere bacteria. The citation @@CITATION@@ is used here to support this statement, indicating that this is a recent focus of research. It doesn't seem to be comparing methods or results with the current paper or other studies, nor is it introducing a foundation for the current research. Instead, it's providing evidence that the shift has indeed occurred, so the intent is supportive.

Next, I need to assign the most appropriate rhetorical class. Looking at the classes, "Support" is when the citation is used to confirm or back up the current work's claims. In this case, the @@CITATION@@ supports the assertion that recent studies focus on plant growth promotion, so "Support" is the correct classification.

Therefore, the final label is "Support."
