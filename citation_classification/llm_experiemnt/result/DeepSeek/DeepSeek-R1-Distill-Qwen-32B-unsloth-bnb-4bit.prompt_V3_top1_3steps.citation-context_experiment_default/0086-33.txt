Step 1: Extract the context discussing the citation @@CITATION@@. Keep only the semantic context useful to understand the intent of the citation @@CITATION@@.

Context: The passage states that the cited work reports conflicting results about the concentration of 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' in different plant tissues, specifically in daisy plants and a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima.

Step 2: Identify the general intent of the citation.

The citation is comparing two studies to point out their differing results on the same topic. It's showing that while one study found high concentration in leaves and roots, another reported conflicting results for a similar phytoplasma in a different plant.

Step 3: Select the specific rhetorical class.

This fits the definition of CoCoRes, as it's directly comparing the results of the cited works with each other.
