Okay, so I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage to a specific rhetorical class. Let me break down the steps as per the instructions.

First, I'll extract the context discussing the citation. The passage provided is: 

In previous studies, researchers have explored the impact of magnetic fields on calcite scale formation. For instance, in @@CITATION@@, it was demonstrated that magnetic treatment could effectively prevent the formation of hard calcite scales on surfaces exposed to hard water. 

Looking at the context, the citation is mentioned in a previous study that showed how magnetic treatment prevents calcite scale formation. 

Next, I need to identify the general intent of the citation. The passage is using this citation to support their point about magnetic fields preventing calcite scale formation. They're showing that their results align with previous research, which is a form of support.

Now, mapping this to the predefined rhetorical classes. Since the citation is used to support or confirm the current work's findings, the most appropriate class is 'Support'.
</think>

The citation is used to confirm previous findings, supporting the current study's results.

**Step-by-step explanation:**

1. The citation references a study showing magnetic treatment prevents calcite scale formation.
2. This aligns with the current study's findings, providing confirmation.
3. Therefore, the citation serves to support the current work.

**Answer:** Support
