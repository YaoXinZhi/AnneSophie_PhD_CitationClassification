Okay, so I need to classify the citation reference @@CITATION@@ in a given passage into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. Let's go through the process step by step.

First, I'll extract the context surrounding the citation. The passage mentions that recent investigations of bacterial communities in fleas and ticks found the arthropod host to govern the bacterial assemblages, while rodent hosts and environmental conditions were less influential. It then cites @@CITATION@@, referencing another study's findings.

Next, I need to identify the general intent of the citation. The passage is noting that another study supports their own finding, meaning it's used to confirm or back up their results. That suggests it's a supportive citation.

Looking at the specific classes, Support is the most appropriate here. The citation isn't comparing methods, results, or explaining a problem; it's simply confirming the current study's conclusion with prior research.

So, the rhetorical class should be Support.
