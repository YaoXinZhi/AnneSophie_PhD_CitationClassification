Okay, so I'm trying to determine the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let's go through the process step by step.

First, I'll extract the context surrounding the citation. The passage mentions that the citation provides "conflicting results." This suggests that the study being cited reported on results that are in contrast to previous findings or other studies.

Next, I need to identify the general intent of the citation. Since the context refers to conflicting results, it seems like the authors are comparing or contrasting the findings of the cited work with others. This points towards a comparative intent, specifically looking at results or explanations.

Now, looking at the predefined classes, CoCoRes is about comparing results, CoCoXY is about comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies. In this case, it's conflicting results mentioned for a phytoplasma in a different plant, which indicates a comparison between two studies (Wei et al. and Saracco et al.), not directly comparing to the citing paper's results. So this seems more like CoCoXY.

Alternatively, if only one study's results were being compared to the current paper, it would be CoCoRes. But since there are two studies mentioned with conflicting results, it's more about comparing the cited works themselves.

So the appropriate label here is CoCoXY.
