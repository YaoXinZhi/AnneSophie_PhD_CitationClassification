Alright, I need to classify the citation passage provided. Let me look at the example given: "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly is supported by recent investigations @@CITATION@@." Hmm, the key here is that the citation is used to back up their finding about insect hosts affecting bacterial assembly. This seems like it's supporting their own results with prior research. So, what's the rhetorical class for that? Looking at the definitions, Support is when the citation confirms the work of the citing authors. This fits exactly because the cited work supports their finding. So the label should be Support.
</think>

The citation in the passage is used to support the authors' findings, aligning with the Support class.
