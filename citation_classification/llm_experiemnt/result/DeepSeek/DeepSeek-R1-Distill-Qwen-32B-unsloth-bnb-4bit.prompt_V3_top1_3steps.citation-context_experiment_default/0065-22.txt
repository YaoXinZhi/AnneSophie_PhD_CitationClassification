Okay, so I'm trying to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by understanding the context. The passage says that in the USA, the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975, and cites @@CITATION@@. The task is to figure out the rhetorical class for this citation.

Step 1: Extracting the context. The sentence is a factual statement about the spread of magnetic water treatment devices in the USA since 1975, with a citation. The context seems descriptive, just stating a fact without adding any analysis or comparison.

Step 2: Identifying the general intent. It doesn't seem to be foundational because it's not setting up the basis for the current research. It's not comparing anything, so it's not comparative. There's no motivation or future direction mentioned. It's not supporting or similar to another work either. The citation isn't used to highlight a method or tool, so it's not Usage. There's no criticism of the cited work, so it's not a Weakness. It's purely stating an fact—usage of devices since a certain year—so it fits the descriptive category.

Step 3: Choosing the rhetorical class. The closest class here is Neutral because the citation is used descriptively without supporting, comparing, or motivating. It's just providing a fact about the spread of these devices.
