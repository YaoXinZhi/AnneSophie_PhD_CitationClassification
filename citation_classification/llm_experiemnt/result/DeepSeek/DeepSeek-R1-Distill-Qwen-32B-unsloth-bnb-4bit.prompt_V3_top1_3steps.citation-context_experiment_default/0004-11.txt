Okay, so I need to determine the rhetorical class of the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me go through the steps.

First, I'll look at the context provided. The passage mentions that the reference introduces an advanced system for plant disease detection and validation. The authors of the current paper built upon this system for their analysis and discussion. 

Step 1 is to extract the relevant context. The key part is that the current work is building on the cited system, which implies the citation is foundational to their research.

Moving to Step 2, I need to identify the general intent. Since the current study is based on previous work, the intent here is foundational.

Now, looking at Step 3, the predefined classes. The example given under 'Basis' is when a citation is referenced as the foundation of the current research. In this case, the cited work introduced a system that the current paper is expanding upon. That fits the 'Basis' category because it's the intellectual foundation supporting their study.

I don't think it's any of the other categories like CoCoGM or Support because they're not comparing methods or supporting their findings with the cited work. It's more about the cited work being the starting point for their research.

Step 1: The context is that the cited work introduced an advanced system for plant disease detection and validation, and the current authors built upon this system for their analysis and discussion.

Step 2: The general intent of the citation is Foundational, as the cited work provides the intellectual foundation for the current research.

Step 3: The specific rhetorical class is Basis because the cited work is referenced as the foundational system upon which the current study is built.
