Okay, so I need to assign a rhetorical class to the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me first understand the context. The passage mentions that in flea and tick studies, the arthropod host determines bacterial communities, while rodent hosts and environmental factors don't. It references a specific citation.

Now, looking at the definitions, this seems to be supporting the current study's findings by pointing out a similarity in results. The example given for 'Similar' is when a study's findings are cited to show alignment with the current work. So this fits because it's using the citation to show that other studies also found host influence on bacterial communities, similar to their findings.

Wait, could it be 'Support'? Because it's confirming their result. But I think 'Support' is when directly backing up their own results. Here, it's comparing with another study's findings, which indicates similarity rather than direct support. So it's more like 'Similar' because they are pointing out that another study found the same pattern, thus aligning their findings with existing literature. 

Another point: it's a cross-citation between different studies. The example for 'Similar' includes comparing their findings with others, emphasizing the similarity in results, not necessarily supporting their own directly. Therefore, I think 'Similar' is the appropriate class here.

To determine the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context, I'll follow the outlined steps.

1. **Extract the Context:** The citation is used to support the findings that the arthropod host influences bacterial assemblages, similar to other studies. The passage references a study showing that in fleas and ticks, the host plays a role while other factors don't, mirroring the current study's results.

2. **Identify the General Intent:** The intent here is to show a similarity in results between the cited work and the current study. This falls under the 'Supportive' category, but more specifically, it highlights a similarity.

3. **Select the Specific Rhetorical Class:** The citation is pointing out that other studies have found similar results, thus aligning the current study with existing findings. This aligns with the 'Similar' class as it demonstrates a parallel between the cited work and the current research's observations.

**Answer:** Similar
