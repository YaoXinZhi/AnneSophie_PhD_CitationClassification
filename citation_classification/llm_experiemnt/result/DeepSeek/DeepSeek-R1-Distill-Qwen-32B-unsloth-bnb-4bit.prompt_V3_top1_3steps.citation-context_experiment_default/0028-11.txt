Okay, I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me go through the context again. The citation mentions the taxonomic status of some species being problematic. So, the citing paper is pointing out that the cited work's findings have issues or uncertainties. This seems like they are highlighting a weakness in the previous study. Therefore, the rhetorical class should be 'Weakness'.
</think>

The citation highlights a taxonomic issue in the cited work, indicating a problem or flaw.
