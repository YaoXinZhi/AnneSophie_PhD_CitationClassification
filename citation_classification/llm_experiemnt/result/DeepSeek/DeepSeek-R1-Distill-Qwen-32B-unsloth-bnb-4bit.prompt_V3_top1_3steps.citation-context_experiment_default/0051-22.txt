Alright, I need to determine the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific passage. First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that plant viruses often carry non-coding RNAs, and the citation is used as an example to support this statement. This indicates that the cited work provides evidence that aligns with the current paper's findings. Looking at the possible classes, "Support" fits because the citation is used to confirm or add strength to the current argument. No comparison or criticism is present, so other classes like CoCoRes or Weakness don't apply. Therefore, the most appropriate class is Support.
