Alright, I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in this passage. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the citation reports on the multiplication rates of two strains of 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' in daisy plants, but also notes conflicting results for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia plants.

Next, I consider the general intent. The citation is comparing two studies. One study reports high multiplication rates in daisy plants, while another describes conflicting results in a different plant. This looks like a comparison between two cited works rather than comparing with the current paper's methods or results.

Looking at the specific rhetorical classes, CoCoXY fits because it involves comparing explanations or claims from two different studies.

So, the most appropriate label is CoCoXY.

The citation compares two studies' results, indicating a comparison of explanations or claims.

CoCoXY
