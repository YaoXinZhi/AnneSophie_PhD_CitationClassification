Alright, let me try to figure out the correct rhetorical class for the given citation. I'll go through the steps as instructed.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions a study on how the arthropod host governs bacterial assemblages in fleas and ticks, referencing the cited work. The current study found that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly and that rodent hosts and environmental conditions don't play a significant role. 

Next, I'll determine the general intent. The citation is supporting their finding that the arthropod host is the key factor affecting bacterial assemblages. They're using it to back up their own results, indicating a supportive intent.

Now, looking at the specific labels, the citation is used to support a finding. So, the appropriate rhetorical class here is 'Support'.

The citation is used to support the finding that the arthropod host governs bacterial assemblages, thus it falls under 'Support'.

**Step-by-step Explanation:**
1. **Extract Context:** The citation supports the finding that the arthropod host governs bacterial assemblages in fleas and ticks.
2. **General Intent:** The intent is to support the current study's findings.
3. **Specific Label:** The citation is used to confirm or back up the result, so it's 'Support'.
