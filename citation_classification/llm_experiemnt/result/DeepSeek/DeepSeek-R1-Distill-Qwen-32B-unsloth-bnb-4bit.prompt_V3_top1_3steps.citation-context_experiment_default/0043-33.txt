Okay, so I'm trying to classify the rhetorical class of a citation in a scientific article passage. The citation is tagged as @@CITATION@@. Let me walk through the process step by step.

First, I need to extract the context discussing the citation. The passage is about plant health, specifically mentioning research findings related to bacterial communities in insects. The part in question says, "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria @@CITATION@@."

Alright, so the main point here is that the authors are supporting their finding with another study. They're pointing out that their result isn't isolated but aligns with other research. The context is clearâ€”their finding is corroborated by another investigation.

Next, I need to identify the general intent of the citation. Looking at the list, the options are foundational, comparative, motivational, supportive, technical, critical/analytical, or descriptive. In this case, the citation is used to back up their finding, so it's supportive.

Now, looking at the specific rhetorical classes, the options under supportive are 'Support' and 'Similar'. 'Support' is when the citation directly confirms the current work's results. 'Similar' points out that the cited work and the current paper share similarities in results or patterns.

In the example, the authors explicitly state that their finding is "supported by recent cross-taxon investigations," which means they're using the cited work to confirm their own results. This fits the 'Support' category because it's a direct confirmation without necessarily highlighting similarities beyond the supporting nature.

So, putting it all together, the citation is used to support the current finding by referencing another study that corroborates it. Therefore, the rhetorical class is 'Support'.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The citation is used to support the current finding with another study.
2. The intent is to confirm the result, not compare or criticize.
3. Direct confirmation indicates the 'Support' class.
