Okay, I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ from the given passage into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. Let me go through the process step by step.

First, I'll extract the context discussing the citation. The passage mentions a previous study by @@CITATION@@ where they studied a plant disease under controlled conditions. It then says that the current research uses field experiments to validate those findings.

Next, I'll identify the general intent. The current study is using the cited work to back up their own findings, which suggests the citation is supportive.

Now, mapping this to the specific classes, the best fit seems to be "Support" because the citation is confirming the research's findings. There's no comparison, motivation, or criticism involved here. It's purely supportive.

Support

Step 1: The context discusses a previous study (citation @@CITATION@@) that studied a plant disease under controlled conditions and how their findings contribute to the current study's field experiments to validate the effect of temperature.

Step 2: The intent is to support the current research by referencing a prior study's findings that are being validated in the current work.

Step 3: The rhetorical class is Support because the citation is used to confirm the research's findings.
