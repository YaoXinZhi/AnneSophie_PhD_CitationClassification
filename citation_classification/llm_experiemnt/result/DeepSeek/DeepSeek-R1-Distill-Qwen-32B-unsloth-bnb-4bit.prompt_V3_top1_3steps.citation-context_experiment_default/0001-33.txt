Okay, I need to determine the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. 

First, I'll extract the context. The passage mentions that the method of @@CITATION@@ was used to assess pathogen presence. This indicates that the cited work provided a specific method which the current study utilized.

Next, I need to identify the general intent. Since the current study is directly applying a method from the cited work, this points towards a "Technical" intent, as they're using a tool or method from the cited paper.

Looking at the predefined classes, the most appropriate one here is "Usage," which refers to when a cited work is used for a method, tool, dataset, or setup in the current study.

Therefore, the label should be "Usage."
