Alright, so I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific article passage into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. Let's go through the steps carefully.

First, I should extract the context around the citation. The passage is within backticks: "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@." 

Step 1: The context here is that the citation is used to state that magnetic water treatment devices have been spreading in the USA since 1975. It's a factual statement without any comparison, support, criticism, or motivation for the current study.

Step 2: The general intent of the citation seems to be descriptive. The author is simply providing information about the spread of these devices without using it to support a claim, compare methods, or suggest future research.

Step 3: Looking at the predefined classes, this fits into "Neutral" because the citation is used neutrally to present a fact without contributing to any argument or comparison in the current paper.

So, the most appropriate label is Neutral.
