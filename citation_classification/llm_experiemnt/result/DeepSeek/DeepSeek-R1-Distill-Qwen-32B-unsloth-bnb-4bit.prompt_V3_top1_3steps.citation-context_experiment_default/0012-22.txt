Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class of the citation in this passage. Let's start by reading through the step-by-step process.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage says, "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@@." 

Hmm, the citation is right after a sentence that mentions supporting evidence. The cited work is about other cross-taxon investigations showing similar findings in fleas and ticks. The main point is that the arthropod host influenced the bacterial community, which supports their own findings.

Next, I need to identify the general intent. The sentence uses the citation to back up their results, so it's a supportive intent. They are showing that their finding isn't isolated, which strengthens their argument.

Now, looking at the specific classes, 'Support' is the one where the citation confirms the work or findings of the current paper. The example given for Support is when a study is cited to back up results, which fits here since the cited work supports their findings.

So, putting it all together, the citation is used to support the current paper's results, making the rhetorical class 'Support'.

The citation is used to support the current paper's findings by referencing similar results from another study.
