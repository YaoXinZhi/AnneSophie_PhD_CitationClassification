Okay, so I have to classify the citation in this passage. Let me read through the context given. The passage mentions that plant pathogens cause huge economic losses and are a significant threat. They then point to a specific citation by Smith et al. (2020) that quantifies these losses annually.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The sentence states the problem of plant pathogens and then cites Smith et al. to provide a specific quantification of the losses, giving a concrete example of $20 billion. 

Next, I have to determine the general intent of this citation. It looks like the citation is used to support their statement about the economic impact. The authors are citing previous work to back up their claims with data. So it's likely a supportive intent.

Looking at the predefined classes, "Support" is the category where the citation is used to confirm or back up the work of the current authors. This fits because the citation from Smith et al. provides the necessary data to substantiate their claim about the economic losses.

There's no indication of comparison, motivation, criticism, or any other intent here. It's purely used to support their argument.

The citation is used to support the claim about the economic impact, providing empirical data. 

Step-by-step explanation:
1. The citation is used to back up the statement about economic losses.
2. The intent is to support the argument with data from another study.
3. The class is "Support."

**Step-by-step explanation:**
The citation is used to back up the claim about the significant economic losses caused by plant pathogens by providing specific data from Smith et al. (2020). This is done to support the argument with concrete evidence.

**Answer:** Support
