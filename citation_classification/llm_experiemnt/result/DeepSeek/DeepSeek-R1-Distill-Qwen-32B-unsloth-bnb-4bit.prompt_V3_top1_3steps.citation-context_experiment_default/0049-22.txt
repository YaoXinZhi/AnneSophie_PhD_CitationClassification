Alright, so I need to classify this citation as one of the given rhetorical classes. Let's see what the passage says. The context is about the effectiveness of magnetic water treatment devices in the USA. The citation is used to provide information that the use of these devices has been spreading since 1975 in the USA. 

First, the step is to extract the context. The passage is purely stating a fact about when and where these devices started being used more. There's no indication that the author is comparing it to other studies, using it as a foundation for their research, or supporting their own findings. It seems like a neutral piece of information.

Next, identifying the general intent. The way it's presented is just descriptive, providing background without any supporting, contrasting, or critical tone. It's simply stating a trend.

Finally, assigning the class. From the list, 'Neutral' fits because the citation is used in a descriptive manner without any other intent like comparison, support, or motivation.
