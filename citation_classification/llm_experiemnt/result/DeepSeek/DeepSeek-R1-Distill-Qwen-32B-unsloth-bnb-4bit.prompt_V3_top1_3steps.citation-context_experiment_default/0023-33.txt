Alright, I need to determine the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. First, I'll extract the context. The passage mentions that the formation of hard calcite scale was prevented with a magnetic field, and this previous work @@CITATION@@ sets the stage for the current research aiming to understand the mechanism. Next, I identify the intent: it justifies why this research is being conducted, indicating a motivation. Finally, the label fits under 'Motivation' because it explains the reason behind the current study.

The context discusses how a previous study used a magnetic field to prevent calcite scale formation, motivating the current research to understand the mechanism.
