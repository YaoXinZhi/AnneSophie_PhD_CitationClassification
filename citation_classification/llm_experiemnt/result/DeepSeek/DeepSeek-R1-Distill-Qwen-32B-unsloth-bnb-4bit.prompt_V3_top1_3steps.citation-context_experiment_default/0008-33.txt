Okay, I need to determine the correct rhetorical class for a citation. Let me go through the process step by step.

First, I should extract the relevant context around the citation. The passage here is discussing the application of magnetic fields to prevent hard water scaling. It mentions that the current study looks into the mechanism behind this phenomenon. The citation (Kleine et al., 2003) is used to introduce prior research findings.

Looking at the context, the study cited by Kleine et al. showed that magnetic fields could prevent calcite scale formation, and now the current research is about understanding why this happens. This suggests that the cited work provides the foundation or basis for the current study.

So, the intent of the citation is foundational. It's referencing previous work that this research is building upon. That fits the "Basis" category because it's introducing the intellectual foundation.

Therefore, the rhetorical class should be Basis.
