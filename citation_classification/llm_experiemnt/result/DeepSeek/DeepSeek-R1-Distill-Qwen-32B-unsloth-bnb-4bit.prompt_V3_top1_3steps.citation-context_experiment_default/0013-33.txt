Alright, let me go through the process step by step. 

First, I need to extract the context surrounding the citation @@CITATION@@. Looking at the user's initial message, the example given is: "Fast multiplication rates... conflicting results... @@CITATION@@." So the surrounding context is about conflicting results from two studies, one mentioned in the text (Wei et al., 2004; Saracco et al., 2006) and the cited one via @@CITATION@@.

Next, I identify the general intent. The passage is comparing conflicting results between studies. It seems like the citation is used to point out a contradiction, possibly comparing explanations or claims between two studies.

Now, mapping this to the rhetorical classes, the example provided for CoCoXY exactly fits this scenario where two cited works are compared. So the intent is to compare explanations or claims between studies, not with the current paper but between each other.

Therefore, the most appropriate label is CoCoXY.
