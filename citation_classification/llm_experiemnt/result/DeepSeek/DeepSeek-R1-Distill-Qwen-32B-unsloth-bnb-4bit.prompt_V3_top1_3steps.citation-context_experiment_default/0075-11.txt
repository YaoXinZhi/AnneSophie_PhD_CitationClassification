Alright, so I'm trying to classify the rhetorical class of the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I need to extract the context discussing the citation. The passage is about a plant health study and mentions that the cited work identified a specific pathogen in a host plant. The authors then compared their findings with this previous research.

Next, I should determine the general intent. The context shows that the current study is comparing its results with the cited work. So, it's a comparative intent.

Looking at the predefined classes, the most appropriate one here is CoCoRes because they're comparing results of two studies.
