Okay, let's break this down. I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the cited work in the given passage. First, I'll look at the passage to understand the context around the citation.

The passage mentions that the cited work (@@CITATION@@) has shown that the formation of hard calcite scale on surfaces exposed to hard water can be prevented using a magnetic field. The authors of the current study are now trying to understand the mechanism behind this effect. 

So, the citation is used to explain why this current research is being conducted. The previous work demonstrated a phenomenon (preventive effect of magnetic fields on scale formation), and the current study is addressing a knowledge gap by focusing on the mechanism. This aligns with the 'Motivation' category because it's justifying the need for the current research by highlighting an open question that wasn't answered before.

I don't think it's 'Basis' because they're not building their work on previous foundational studies but rather using it to motivate their own study. It's not a comparison (which would fall under CoCoGM, CoCoRes, etc.), nor is it supporting or questioning the cited work. It's clearly about justifying why the study is happening now.

The citation is used to justify why the current research is being conducted by highlighting a knowledge gap. The previous work showed the phenomenon, but the mechanism wasn't explained, prompting the current study.
