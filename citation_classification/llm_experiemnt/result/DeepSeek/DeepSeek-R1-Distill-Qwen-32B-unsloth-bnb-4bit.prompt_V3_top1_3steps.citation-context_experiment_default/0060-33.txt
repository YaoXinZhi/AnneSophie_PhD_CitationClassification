Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. The passage is about the use of magnetic fields to prevent calcite scale formation, and the authors are citing their own work for the phenomenon's explanation. 

Step 1: Extract the context around the citation. The relevant part is about explaining why the current research is being conducted, referencing a previous study that showed the effect of magnetic fields on scale formation but didn't offer an explanation. 

Step 2: Identify the general intent. Since they're citing their own work to show a phenomenon that hasn't been explained yet, this is a Motivation intent. They're identifying a knowledge gap that their current research aims to address.

Step 3: Select the specific label. The citation is used to justify the current research by pointing out an unexplained phenomenon from their previous work, so the most appropriate class is Motivation.
