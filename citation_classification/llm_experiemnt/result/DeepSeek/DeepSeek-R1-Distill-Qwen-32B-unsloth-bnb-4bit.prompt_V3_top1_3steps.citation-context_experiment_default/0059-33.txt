Alright, I'm trying to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me go through the steps.

First, the passage mentions that the citation discusses conflicting results regarding a phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima. It cites Wei et al., 2004, and Saracco et al., 2006. The author is comparing two studies to highlight their contrasting findings.

Now, looking at the rhetorical classes, I need to find which one fits best. Comparing two cited works with each other, not the current paper, falls under CoCoXY. This is because CoCoXY is about comparing explanations or claims between two studies.

So, the context involves comparing the results of two studies, which matches the definition of CoCoXY.
