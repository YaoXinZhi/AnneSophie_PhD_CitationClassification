Okay, I need to determine the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let's go through the process step by step.

First, I should extract the context around the citation. The passage is: "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@@."

So the context is about supporting the authors' findings. They mention that their findings are supported by other investigations, and then cite the study that provides this support. This suggests that the citation is being used to back up their results.

Next, identifying the general intent. The authors are using the citation to confirm their own results, which falls under the supportive category. They are not comparing their methods or results, nor are they introducing foundational work or motivating their study. They're specifically pointing out that their work aligns with prior research.

Now, looking at the predefined categories, "Support" is the most appropriate. The citation is used to confirm or corroborate the findings presented in the paper. It directly mentions that the cited work supports their results.

The citation is used to support the authors' findings by referencing another study that confirms their results, particularly about insect hosts affecting bacterial community assembly.

**Answer:** Support
