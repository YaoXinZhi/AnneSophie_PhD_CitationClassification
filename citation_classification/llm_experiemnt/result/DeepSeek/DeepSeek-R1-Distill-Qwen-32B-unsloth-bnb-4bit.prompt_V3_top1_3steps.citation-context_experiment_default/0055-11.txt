Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to classify this citation @@CITATION@@ in the context provided. Let me go through the process step by step.

First, looking at Step 1, I need to extract the context discussing the citation. The passage given is about the use of magnetic water treatment devices in the USA, specifically mentioning that their use has been spreading since 1975, citing @@CITATION@@. 

Moving on to Step 2, I need to identify the general intent of this citation. The sentence is purely informative. It states a fact about the spread of these devices without using the citation to support, compare, motivate, or critique anything. It's a neutral statement.

Finally, Step 3: selecting the specific rhetorical class. Since the citation is used to provide a factual statement without any supporting, comparing, or critical intent, the correct label is Neutral.
