Alright, I need to classify a citation in a plant health article. The passage I got is:

"The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@."

Step 1: Extract the context. The sentence is talking about the experimental setup, so the context is about the method used in the study.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation is referring to where the setup was described. This indicates that the method is being used from the cited work.

Step 3: Look at predefined classes. Usage fits because it's citing a method used directly in their study.
