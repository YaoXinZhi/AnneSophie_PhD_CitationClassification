Okay, so I have this task where I need to classify a citation in a scientific article passage. The citation is tagged as @@CITATION@@, and I have to determine the rhetorical class it belongs to from the predefined list. Let me go through the process step by step.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The context is given within backticks, so I'll focus on that. The passage is about plant health, specifically looking into how endophytic bacteria from healthy plants can inhibit pathogens. The study they're citing (Lugtenberg and Klaassen, 2013) apparently identified the main endophytic bacteria and their beneficial functions for plants. The current study found that these bacteria can inhibit pathogens, supporting the citation's findings.

Next, I need to identify the general intent of the citation. The authors are using the cited work to support their own findings. They're showing that their results align with what has been previously established, which suggests a supportive intent.

Now, looking at the specific rhetorical classes, the one that fits best is "Support." The citation is used to confirm or back up their findings by referencing a reliable source that previously identified the beneficial functions of these bacteria. It's not a comparison, motivation, or usage of a method; it's purely supporting the current results with prior research.

So, putting it all together, the citation is used to support the current findings by referencing earlier work that demonstrates the same beneficial effects. That makes the rhetorical class "Support."

The citation is used to support the current findings by referencing prior research showing similar beneficial effects. 

**Step-by-step Explanation:**

1. **Extract Context:** The study refers to Lugtenberg and Klaassen (2013) identifying main endophytic bacteria providing beneficial functions. The current work found these bacteria inhibit pathogens, supporting the prior findings.

2. **Identify Intent:** The intent is to support their results with prior research.

3. **Assign Rhetorical Class:** The citation is used to back up their findings, fitting the "Support" class.
