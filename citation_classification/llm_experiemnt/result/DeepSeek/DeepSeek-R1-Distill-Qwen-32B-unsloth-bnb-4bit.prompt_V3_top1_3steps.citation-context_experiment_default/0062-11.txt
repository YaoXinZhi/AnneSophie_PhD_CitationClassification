Okay, so I need to determine the rhetorical class for a citation in a scientific passage. The process involves three main steps: extracting the relevant context, identifying the general intent, and selecting the specific rhetorical class.

First, I look at the citation in the context provided. The example given is about the comparison of conflicting results regarding phytoplasma in different plants. The citation is used to show that some studies found fast multiplication rates, while others described conflicting results. 

Next, I analyze the intent. The author is comparing two studies by citing them together. This indicates a comparative purpose but not between the citing paper and the cited works. Instead, it's comparing the cited works themselves.

Finally, I match this to the predefined classes. Since the citation is comparing two cited works with each other, the appropriate class is CoCoXY.
