Alright, I need to determine the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific article passage. Let's follow the steps outlined.

First, I should extract the context surrounding the citation. The passage mentions that the citation highlights the problem of pathogenicity variation in the genus Fusarium for wheat. This suggests that the cited work is pointing out a challenge or issue that the current study is addressing.

Next, I need to identify the general intent of the citation. Since the citation is presenting a problem that the current research aims to tackle, it's likely serving a Motivational purpose. This is because it's justifying why the current study is being conducted by identifying an existing knowledge gap or issue.

Now, considering the predefined classes, the correct label would be 'Motivation' because the citation is used to set the stage for the study by pointing out a specific problem that needs addressing. It's not comparing results or methods, nor is it supporting or criticizing previous work. It's specifically motivating the research by highlighting a challenge.
