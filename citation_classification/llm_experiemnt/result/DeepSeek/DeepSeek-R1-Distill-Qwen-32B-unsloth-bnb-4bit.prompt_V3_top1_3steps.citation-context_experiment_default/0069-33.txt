Alright, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to determine the rhetorical class of a citation tagged @@CITATION@@ in a scientific article passage. 

First, I'll look at the context provided. The user mentioned an example where the citation is used to compare two studies on the same subject but found conflicting results. 

Step 1: Extracting the context. The passage discusses conflicting results between two studies, both on the same topic of phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima. 

Step 2: Identifying the general intent. The citation is comparing the findings of two studies, so it's a comparative use.

Step 3: Selecting the specific rhetorical class. Since the comparison is between two cited works rather than with the current paper, it falls under CoCoXY.
