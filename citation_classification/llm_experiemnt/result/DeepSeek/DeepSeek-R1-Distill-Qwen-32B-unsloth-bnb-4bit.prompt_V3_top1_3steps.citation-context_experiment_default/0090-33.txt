Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class of the citation in the given passage. Let me start by understanding the context provided.

The passage mentions that the classification method's performance can be influenced by various factors. It then cites "@@CITATION@@" which has shown that the selection of appropriate feature sets is crucial. The purpose of mentioning this is to provide support for the idea that feature set selection is important.

Now, looking at the possible rhetorical classes, Support is when the citation is used to confirm the current paper's work or findings. Since the citation is highlighting that the right feature sets matter, it's backing up the point the authors are making. There's no comparison, motivation, or criticism hereâ€”it's purely supporting the argument.

So the appropriate label should be Support.
</think>

Step 1: The context discusses how the choice of feature sets affects classification performance and cites a work that demonstrates this, indicating the importance of feature selection.

Step 2: The intent is to support the idea that feature set selection affects performance by referencing prior research.

Step 3: The rhetorical class is Support.
