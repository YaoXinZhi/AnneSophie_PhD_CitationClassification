Okay, I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. Let's see. The passage says that previous work identified a gene causing a particular trait, and the current study shows another gene responsible for the same trait. 

Step 1: The context explains that the cited work and the current study are both looking at the same trait but in different genes. They’re both contributing to understanding the same issue from different angles.

Step 2: The general intent here is a comparison of results because the current study is contrasting their findings with the previous one—showing that a different gene is responsible.

Step 3: So, this falls under CoCoRes, which is about comparing results of cited work with the current paper. Both studies are about the same trait but different genes, highlighting contrasting results.
