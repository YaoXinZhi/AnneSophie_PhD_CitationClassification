Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify this citation. The task is to determine the rhetorical class of the @@CITATION@@ in the given context. First, I'll extract the context to understand the intent. The passage mentions that researchers found conflicting results regarding the occurrence of a specific pathogen in certain plants, referencing @@CITATION@@. 

Next, I need to identify the general intent. The citation is used to point out a contradiction between studies, not comparing with the current paper's results but showing conflicting findings between two cited works. This seems to fall under a comparative category, but specifically between two cited studies rather than the citing paper.

Looking at the definitions, CoCoXY is for comparisons between two cited works. In the example given, conflicting results from different studies are cited, which matches the CoCoXY class. The context is showing a discrepancy, so the citation isn't supporting, motivating, or providing a basis but rather comparing two findings.
