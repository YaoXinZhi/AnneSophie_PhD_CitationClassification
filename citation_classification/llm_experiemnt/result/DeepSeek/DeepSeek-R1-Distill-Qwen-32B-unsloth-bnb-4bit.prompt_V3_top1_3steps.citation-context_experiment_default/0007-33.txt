Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in this passage. Let me go through it step by step.

First, I need to extract the context surrounding the citation. The passage talks about the presence of several pathogenic agents in honeybee colonies, specifically mentioning Nosema apis and nosema ceranae. It says that these have been identified in different countries, citing @@CITATION@@, and then contrasts that with how other countries like France, Germany, and Spain have found primarily N. apis.

Now, looking at the context, the cited work is discussing the presence of Nosema species in China. The passage is using this citation to show a comparative aspect—comparing the findings in one country (China) with others (France, Germany, Spain). So the intent here seems to be a comparison of results.

The task is to assign a rhetorical class. From the definitions, CoCoRes stands for Comparison of Results. It's used when the citation is comparing results or findings with those of the current paper. Since the passage is comparing which Nosema species are found in different countries based on citations, this fits into CoCoRes.

I think that's the correct classification because it's directly对比ing the results of the cited study with other studies, highlighting the differences in findings regarding the Nosema species present.
