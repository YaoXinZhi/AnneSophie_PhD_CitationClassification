Okay, I need to determine the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let's start by understanding the context.

The passage mentions that plant-parasitic nematodes are a major threat and describes the challenges in controlling them. They state that chemical controls are used but are facing resistance. Then, they introduce RNA interference as a new approach and refer to a study that identified RNAi targets in the root-knot nematode.

Looking at the context, the citation is used to introduce RNAi targets. The authors are presenting a new method, so they are using the cited work to support or confirm that this approach is viable. It's about supporting their own method by referencing an earlier finding that identified targets, thereby confirming the potential of RNAi in nematode control. Therefore, the rhetorical class should be Support.
</think>

The citation is used to support the introduction of RNA interference by referencing a previous study that identified RNAi targets, confirming its potential.

Step-by-step explanation:
1. The context discusses RNA interference as a new approach.
2. The citation references a study identifying RNAi targets in a nematode.
3. This supports the viability of the method, hence it's supportive.
