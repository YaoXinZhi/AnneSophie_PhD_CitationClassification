Alright, so I'm trying to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. The task is to figure out the rhetorical class of the citation in the plant health domain. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the researchers looked at the bacterial communities in insects and found that the host arthropod determines the bacterial assemblages, similar to another study. They reference a citation (@@CITATION@@) to back this up.

Looking at this, the context is about supporting their findings with a similar study. The researchers are not comparing methods or discussing foundational work, nor are they pointing out weaknesses or suggesting future work. Instead, they're showing that their results align with existing research.

Next, the general intent here seems to be supportive. They're using the citation to back their own findings, not to contrast or compare. This aligns with the Support or Similar classes.

Now, selecting the specific class: Support is when the citation reinforces the current work's results, and Similar is when it's pointing out a similarity between the cited work and theirs. The example given mentions that their findings are supported by another investigation, so it's more about support rather than just similarity.

Therefore, the rhetorical class should be Support.

The citation is used to support the current findings by referencing a similar study.
