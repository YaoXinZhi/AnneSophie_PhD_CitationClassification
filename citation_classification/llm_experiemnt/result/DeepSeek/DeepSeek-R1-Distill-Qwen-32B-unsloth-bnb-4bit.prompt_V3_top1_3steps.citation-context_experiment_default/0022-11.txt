Alright, I need to classify the rhetorical class of the citation @@CITATION@@ in the provided passage. First, I'll extract the relevant context around the citation. The passage mentions using an image analysis platform called Imagene for phenotypic studies. It states that Imagene allows the assessment of plant health and phenotyping traits like leaf number, area, and color, referencing the cited work. 

Next, I'll determine the general intent. The citation is used to introduce a tool that's being applied in the current study. This suggests that the purpose is to highlight the method or tool used, not to compare, support, or critique. 

Looking at the predefined classes, the 'Usage' category fits here because Imagene is being referenced for its methodological application in the study. So, the citation is indicating the use of a specific tool or method from the cited work.
