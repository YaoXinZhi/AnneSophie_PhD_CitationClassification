Okay, so I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. Let me start by carefully reading the passage to understand the context and the role of the citation.

Looking at the context: The authors are discussing the replication of previous results. They mention that "our findings replicate the results reported by @@CITATION@@, which found no significant differences..." This indicates that the citation is being used to show that their current results align with a previous study.

Now, considering the predefined classes:
- **Support**: This is when the citation is used to confirm the work or findings of the current authors. The passage directly mentions replicating results, which supports their current findings by referencing prior work.
- **Similar**: This is when the citation points out a similarity in results or patterns, but in this case, it's more about replication than similarity.
- **CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY**: These are about comparisons, which isn't the case here since the focus is on replicating, not contrasting.
- **Basis**: This is for foundational work, but the passage doesn't mention it as a foundation.
- **Motivation, Future, Usage, Weakness, Neutral**: None of these seem applicable here as the citation is about supporting findings.

Therefore, the most appropriate label is **Support**.

The citation is used to support the current findings by referencing a previous study that reported similar results.
