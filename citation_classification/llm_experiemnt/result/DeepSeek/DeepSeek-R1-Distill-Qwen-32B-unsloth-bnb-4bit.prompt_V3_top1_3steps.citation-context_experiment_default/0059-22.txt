Okay, I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the context provided is a passage about the formation of hard calcite scales on surfaces exposed to hard water. The authors mention that their previous research (cited here) has shown that applying a magnetic field can prevent this scale buildup. However, the mechanism behind this effect hasn't been explained yet, and the current work aims to understand it.

Now, the general intent of this citation seems to be about providing motivation. They're citing their own previous work to show that while the application is known, the underlying reason is not, thus justifying the current research. So, they're using the citation to set up the rationale for their study.

Looking at the predefined classes, "Motivation" seems fitting here because it's used to justify why the current research is being conducted. The authors are pointing out a knowledge gap (why the magnetic field works) that their new study aims to address.

So, the most appropriate label is "Motivation".
