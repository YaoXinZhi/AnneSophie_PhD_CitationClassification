Okay, so I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. Let's follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the findings are "supported by" previous studies, specifically pointing out that in fleas and ticks, arthropod hosts influenced bacterial communities, not rodent hosts or environmental factors. This suggests the citation is being used to back up a similar point made in the current work.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. Since the citation is providing support for the current study's results, the intent is supportive.

Step 3: Select the specific rhetorical class. Looking at the options, "Support" is the most appropriate because the citation directly affirms the current findings by referencing similar results from other studies. It's not a comparison but a confirmation.

Step 1: The context shows the citation is used to support the current findings by referencing similar results from other studies.

Step 2: The intent is supportive as it confirms the current research's conclusion.
