Okay, I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific article passage into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. First, I'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Extract the context discussing the citation. Let's look at the passage provided. The citation is mentioned in the context that "the citation is used to suggest or imply directions for future research." The example given is about a small aphid gut binding peptide suggesting broader applicability.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation here is being used to point towards future research directions, which aligns with the 'Future' category.

Step 3: Select the specific rhetorical class. The context explicitly mentions that the citation is for future research, so the most appropriate label is 'Future'.
