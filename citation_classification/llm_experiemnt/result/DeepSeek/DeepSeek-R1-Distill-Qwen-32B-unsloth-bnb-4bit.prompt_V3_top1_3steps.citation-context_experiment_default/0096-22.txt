Alright, I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me start by reading the task and understanding the steps involved.

First, I should extract the context around the citation. The context provided is about the formation of hard calcite scale on surfaces exposed to hard water and how it's prevented by a magnetic field. The citation is mentioned right after that, explaining that the purpose of the current work is to understand the mechanism behind this beneficial influence.

Next, I need to determine the general intent of the citation. Looking at the example, the citation is referring to their previous research, which showed the prevention of scale formation. The current work is building on this by aiming to understand the mechanism. This suggests that the citation is providing a foundation for their current research, indicating a basis.

Now, mapping this to the predefined classes, the intent here is foundational because the authors are referencing their previous work to set the stage for their current study. They're not comparing methods or results, nor are they supporting or criticizing the cited work. Instead, they're establishing their research's foundation.

So, the most appropriate rhetorical class would be "Basis" since it provides the intellectual foundation for the current study.

Step 1: The context discusses the formation of hard calcite scale and the citing paper's aim to understand the mechanism behind magnetic treatment, referencing their previous work.

Step 2: The general intent is Foundational, as the citation introduces prior research that the current study builds upon to investigate the mechanism.

Step 3: The specific rhetorical class is Basis.
