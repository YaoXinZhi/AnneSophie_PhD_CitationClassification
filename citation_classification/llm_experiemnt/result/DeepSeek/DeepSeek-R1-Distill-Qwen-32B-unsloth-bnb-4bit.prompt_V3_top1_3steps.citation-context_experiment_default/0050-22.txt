Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me go through the steps one by one. 

First, I need to extract the context discussing the citation. The passage is about plant health, specifically the multiplication rates and concentration of 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains in daisy plants. It mentions that conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima.

Next, I have to identify the general intent of the citation. It looks like the authors are pointing out conflicting findings between two studies. One study reports high concentrations, and another (the cited one) describes conflicting results. So, they're comparing the explanations or claims made by two different studies.

Looking at the predefined classes, this fits under CoCoXY because it's a comparison between two cited studies without directly relating to the citing paper's work. It's not comparing their methods or results with their own, just highlighting a discrepancy between the two cited papers.

So, the most appropriate label here is CoCoXY.
