Alright, I'm trying to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me go through the steps carefully.

Step 1: Extract the context. The passage mentions that previous studies have shown conflicting results about 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains. It specifically cites two studies where results differ. 

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The context is comparing results from two studies. One reports high concentrations in certain plants, while another describes conflicting results in a different context. 

Step 3: Select the rhetorical class. Since the citation is comparing the results of two studies with each other, not the citing paper, this aligns with CoCoRes. There's a direct comparison of findings between them.
