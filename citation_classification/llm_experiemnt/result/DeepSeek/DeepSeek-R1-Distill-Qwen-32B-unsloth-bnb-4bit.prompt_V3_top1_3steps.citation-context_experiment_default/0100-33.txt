Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the given citation. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the context provided. The passage is about the identification of a phytoplasma strain. It mentions a previous finding where conflicting results were described regarding a different phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima, citing the specific citation.

Now, identifying the general intent: The citation is comparing results between two studies. The first mentions high concentration in young leaves, while the second describes conflicting results in a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia. So, it's about contrasting findings between studies.

Looking at the definitions, CoCoRes is for comparing results, but in this case, it's comparing two cited studies, not with the current paper. So, the correct class would be CoCoXY because it's comparing explanations or claims of two cited works.

Wait, no, CoCoXY is when two studies are compared with each other, not necessarily the current one. So this fits because the current paper is pointing out conflicting results between the two cited studies.
</think>

The context describes conflicting results from two different studies, comparing their findings.
