Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which rhetorical class the citation @@CITATION@@ falls into based on the given passage. Let me go through the steps.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the citation is about the application of magnetic treatment in preventing hard calcite scale formation and that the mechanism was not yet explained. The current work's purpose is to understand this mechanism.

Next, I should identify the general intent. Since the authors are citing a previous study that showed results and are now trying to explain them, it seems like they're using this citation to justify their current research. So, it might be under Motivation or Basis.

Wait, let me check the definitions again. Basis is when the cited work provides the intellectual foundation. Motivation is when it's used to justify why the research is being conducted, like pointing out a knowledge gap.

In this case, the citation is showing that the phenomenon was observed but not explained, which is why the current study is necessary. So that seems to fall under Motivation because it's explaining the reason behind the current research.

So, the specific rhetorical class should be Motivation.
