Okay, so I'm trying to assign a rhetorical class to the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me break down the process step by step.

First, I need to extract the context discussing the citation. The passage is about the study of 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains, citing Wei et al., 2004, and Saracco et al., 2012. It mentions conflicting results between these studies regarding the presence of the phytoplasma. The example says that one study found fast multiplication rates, while the other had conflicting results, especially for Euphorbia pulcherrima.

Now, looking at the general intent of the citation: the authors are comparing two studies (Wei and Saracco) to show conflicting results. This indicates a comparison between the cited works themselves, not with their own study.

Next, from the predefined classes, I see CoCoXY is for comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies. Here, the citation is directly contrasting two studies' findings, so it fits the CoCoXY category.
