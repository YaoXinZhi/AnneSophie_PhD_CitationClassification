Alright, I'm looking at this task where I need to classify the reference in a scientific article citation passage. The goal is to assign it to a specific rhetorical class. Let me go through the steps.

First, I need to extract the context discussing the citation @@CITATION@@. The passage is about using a method to study plant health. It says, "our previous research @@CITATION@@ has shown that...the mechanism...is not yet offered."

Next, I have to identify the general intent. The sentence mentions that their previous research showed a phenomenon, and now they're aiming to understand the mechanism. This indicates they're addressing a knowledge gap their previous work identified. 

Now, selecting the rhetorical class. Looking at the definitions, "Motivation" is used when the citation justifies why the current research is being conducted, like identifying a knowledge gap. That fits here because the citation is explaining why this new study is needed.

So the label should be Motivation.

The citation is used to justify why the current research is being conducted by identifying a knowledge gap. 

#OUTPUT
Motivation
