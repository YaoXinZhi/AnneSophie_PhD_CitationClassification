Okay, let me work through this problem step by step. The task is to assign a rhetorical class to a citation in a scientific article within the plant health domain. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation @@CITATION@@ from the passage provided. The example given is: "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@." 

Looking at this sentence, it's a descriptive statement about the spread of magnetic water treatment devices in the USA. The citation here is simply providing a reference for this factual information without any indication that it's being used to support, compare, motivate, or critique anything related to the current study's research.

Next, I identify the general intent of the citation. The sentence is neutral; it's stating a fact and citing the source without connecting it to any argument or comparison. There's no indication that the cited work is being used to justify the current research, compare methods, or point out any limitations.

Finally, selecting the specific rhetorical class, I recall that the "Neutral" label is used when the citation is purely descriptive without serving a supporting, comparative, or critical role. This fits perfectly because the citation is just backing up a factual statement without engaging in any of the other rhetorical functions mentioned.
