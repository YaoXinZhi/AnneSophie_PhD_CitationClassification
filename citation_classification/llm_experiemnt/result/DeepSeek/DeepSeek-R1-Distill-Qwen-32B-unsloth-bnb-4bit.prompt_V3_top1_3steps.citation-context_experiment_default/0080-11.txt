Okay, let's try to figure out the right rhetorical class for the citation in this passage. First, I'll need to extract the context around the citation. The passage says, "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@." This statement is a factual claim about the spread of magnetic water treatment devices in the U.S. starting in 1975.

Next, I should identify the general intent behind this citation. The sentence is providing a statistic or historical fact without expressing any judgment, comparison, or motivation. It's simply stating that the use of these devices has been increasing since a specific year.

Now, looking at the predefined rhetorical classes, I'll consider which one fits best. The statement is neutral because it's just presenting information without supporting, comparing, or criticizing the cited work. It doesn't serve as a motivation or basis for the current research. It's purely descriptive.

So, the label should be "Neutral."
