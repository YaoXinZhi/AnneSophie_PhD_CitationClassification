Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for a citation in a scientific article. The citation is tagged @@CITATION@@, and I need to determine why it's cited. The user provided a context, and I need to process it step by step.

First, I'll read the context carefully. The passage says, "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@@."

So, the authors are talking about their findings related to insect hosts influencing bacterial communities. They mention that their results are supported by recent studies on other insects. The cited work specifically looks at fleas and ticks, showing that the arthropod host is the main factor, not the rodent host or environment.

Step 1 is to extract the context discussing the citation. The relevant part is: "Our finding [...] is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations [...] arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages [...]."

Step 2: Identifying the general intent. The citation is supporting the authors' findings by referencing similar studies. They are using it to back up their own results, indicating a supportive intent.

Looking at the predefined classes, Support is when the citation confirms or supports the current work. Here, the authors explicitly state that their finding is supported by the cited study. Therefore, the rhetorical class should be Support.
