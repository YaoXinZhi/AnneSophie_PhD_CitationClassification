Okay, let's see. I have to classify a citation passage from a plant health article into one of these rhetorical classes. The user provided a structure with context, intent, and specific classes. First, I need to understand the context of the citation.

So, the example given is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." 

Step 1: Extract context. The passage directly compares the results of the present study with those of the cited work. It mentions "substantially differ" from the cited results.

Step 2: Identify general intent. This seems to be a comparison of results. So it's Comparative, which points towards one of the CoCo classes.

Step 3: Choose the specific class. The predefined list includes CoCoRes for comparison of results. The example in the definition aligns exactly with this, so the appropriate class is CoCoRes.
