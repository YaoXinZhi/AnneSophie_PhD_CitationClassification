Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. First, I'll read the passage carefully to understand the context.

The passage says: "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@."

Looking at the context, the sentence is talking about the spread of magnetic water treatment devices in the USA starting from 1975. The citation is right after that statement, so it's referencing a source that provides information about this spread.

Now, I need to determine the general intent of the citation. The sentence is just stating a fact about the spread without any additional commentary or comparison. It's not using the citation to compare with another study, to support the authors' findings, or to suggest future work. It's simply providing a factual statement.

In the predefined classes, "Neutral" is described as citations that are used in a neutral, descriptive way without supporting, comparing, criticizing, or motivating any specific argument. Here, the citation is just providing a source for the spread of magnetic treatment devices, without any deeper analysis or comparison.

So, I think the appropriate rhetorical class here is "Neutral."
