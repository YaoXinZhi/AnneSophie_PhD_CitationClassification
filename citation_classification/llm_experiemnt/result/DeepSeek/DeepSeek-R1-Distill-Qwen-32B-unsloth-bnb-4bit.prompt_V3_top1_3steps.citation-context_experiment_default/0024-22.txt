Okay, so I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific passage into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. Let's go through the steps.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage says, "Eighteen species, collected on cultivated and wild pear, were described from China @@CITATION@@." So the context is about describing species collected from pear trees in China, citing a source.

Next, I'll identify the general intent. The citation is simply stating that these species were described, without any comparison, support, motivation, or criticism. It's more of a neutral mention of a fact.

Now, looking at the specific rhetorical classes, "Neutral" fits because it's a straightforward reference without any supporting, comparing, or critical intent. The citation doesn't justify anything, compare results, or suggest future work. It's just providing information about previous findings.

So the most appropriate label is Neutral.
