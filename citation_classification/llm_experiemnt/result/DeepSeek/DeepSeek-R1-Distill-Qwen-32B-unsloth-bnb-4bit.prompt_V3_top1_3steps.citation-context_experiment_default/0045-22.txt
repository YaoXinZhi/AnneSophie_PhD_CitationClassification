Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific passage. Let me first go through the process step by step.

Step 1: Extract the context discussing the citation. The passage is about plant health, specifically focusing on research into the factors affecting phytoplasma multiplication in daisy plants. The passage mentions that two studies, Wei et al., 2004 and Saracco et al., 2006, reported high multiplication rates of two strains of 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' in young leaves and roots. However, conflicting results were found regarding a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima, and this is cited as @@CITATION@@, referencing another study by someone else.

Step 2: Identify the general intent of the citation. The context is discussing the findings of different studies. The main point is that while some studies show high multiplication rates, another study presents conflicting results. So, the citation is used to point out a discrepancy or conflict between different studies.

Step 3: Select the specific rhetorical class. The options are: Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Motivation, Future, Support, Similar, Usage, Weakness, Neutral. 

Looking at the context, the study is comparing two cited worksâ€”Wei et al. and the cited work. It's not comparing their methods or goals, but their results. However, the citation in question is being contrasted with these previous studies. The example for CoCoXY is where two cited studies are compared or contrasted with each other, not with the citing paper. In this case, the passage mentions Wei et al. and another study (cited as @@CITATION@@) which shows conflicting results. So it's comparing two sources against each other, not against the current paper's results.

Alternatively, it could also be considered a comparison of results because the current paper is highlighting that the cited work's findings are conflicting with previous reports. But according to the definitions, CoCoXY is when comparing two cited studies, not comparing a cited study to the current work. Here, the current work is pointing out that the cited work has conflicting results with others, so it's more of pointing out a similarity in their findings but in conflict.

Wait, the definition of Similar says the citation is used to point out a similarity, but in this case, it's a conflict. So that might not fit. CoCoRes is about comparing results with the citing paper, but here the citing paper is just mentioning conflicting results from the cited work in comparison to others.

Wait, the example given for CoCoXY is where two studies are compared. In this case, the passage says that there are conflicting results described, citing these studies. So the @@CITATION@@ is one of the studies that presents conflicting results to another study. So the context is pointing out that one study (@@CITATION@@) has conflicting results with another. So the usage is to compare two cited studies, which fits CoCoXY.

Alternatively, if the citing paper were comparing their own results with the cited study, that would be CoCoRes, but here it's comparing two cited studies without involving the current paper's results.

So, based on the example given, where Wei et al. and Saracco et al. are cited with conflicting results, and this is cited as @@CITATION@@, it suggests that the citation is being used to highlight a conflict between two studies. That fits under CoCoXY because it's a comparison of explanations or claims between two cited works.
