Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to determine the rhetorical class of the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. 

First, I'll look at the context provided. The passage mentions that in the USA, the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 and cites @@CITATION@@. The sentence is factual, just stating a trend without any additional analysis or comparison.

Next, I'll identify the general intent of the citation. It's a neutral statement about the spread of these devices, without any motivation, support, comparison, or criticism.

Now, mapping this to the predefined classes, the passage doesn't support, compare, criticize, or otherwise engage with the cited work beyond a simple mention. It's purely descriptive.

So, the most appropriate rhetorical class here is Neutral.
