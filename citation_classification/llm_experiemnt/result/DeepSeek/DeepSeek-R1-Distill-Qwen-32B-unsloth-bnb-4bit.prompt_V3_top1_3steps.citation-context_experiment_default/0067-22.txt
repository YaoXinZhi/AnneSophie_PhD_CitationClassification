Alright, I'm trying to assign a rhetorical class to a citation in a scientific article passage. The citation is tagged as @@CITATION@@. The process involves three steps: extracting the context, identifying the general intent, and selecting the specific class.

First, I need to extract the context around @@CITATION@@. I'm looking for any sentences that directly refer to the citation and discuss it. In the given passage, the context mentions that the results obtained in the present work differ from previous experiments using deuterium-saturated metal targets, citing multiple researchers including @@CITATION@@.

Next, I identify the general intent. The passage is comparing results from different studies. The authors are pointing out differences between their findings and those of others, which falls under a comparative intent. Looking at the predefined classes, the comparative intent can be either CoCoRes, CoCoGM, or CoCoXY.

CoCoRes is used when comparing results directly. The passage mentions differing results between the present work and previous experiments. For example, it states that the results substantially differ from those of experiments with deuterium-saturated targets, which are cited. This indicates a direct comparison of results, so CoCoRes seems appropriate here.

I should also consider if it's a comparison of methods or explanations. CoCoGM is for goals or methods, and CoCoXY is for comparing explanations or claims. However, the focus here is on the results differing, so CoCoRes is the best fit.

I don't see any elements of motivation, support, usage, weakness, or neutral intent here. It's purely a comparison of findings, so the specific class should be CoCoRes.
