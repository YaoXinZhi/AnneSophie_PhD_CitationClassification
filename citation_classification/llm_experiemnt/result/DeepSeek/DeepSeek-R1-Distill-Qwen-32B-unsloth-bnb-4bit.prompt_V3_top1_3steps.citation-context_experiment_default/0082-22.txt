Alright, I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given plant health context. Let me go through the steps.

Step 1: Extract the context. The passage discusses the influence of an aphid gut peptide on virus uptake, referencing a study that showed the peptide binding to other aphid species, suggesting broader applicability. The citation is mentioned in this context to illustrate potential future directions.

Step 2: Determine the general intent. The citation is used to suggest possibilities for future research, indicating a Future intent.

Step 3: Assign the specific rhetorical class. Since the citation points to future implications, it's labeled as Future.

Justification: The example provided by the user aligns with the Future category, as the cited work's results point to potential broader applicability, suggesting directions for future investigations.
