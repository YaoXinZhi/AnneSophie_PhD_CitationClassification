Okay, so I need to determine the rhetorical class of the citation in the given passage. The passage provided is:

"Recent research has identified several factors influencing plant health, including soil quality @@CITATION@@, pest management strategies @@CITATION@@, and climate change @@CITATION@@."

First, I'll extract the context around each citation. The citations are mentioned in the context of factors influencing plant health, specifically soil quality, pest management, and climate change.

Next, I need to identify the general intent of each citation. Each citation is supporting a specific factor that influences plant health. The sentence structure is listing these factors and referencing studies that have identified them.

Looking at the classes, Support is when the citation is used to back up a point or finding in the current paper. Since each citation is cited as evidence for a specific factor influencing plant health, this fits the Support category.

Other possible classes could be Basis, but that pertains more to foundational research, which isn't the case here. It's not a comparison (CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY), motivation, future work, or usage of a method. There's no criticism or weakness mentioned. Each citation is used to support the statement about factors influencing plant health.

So the most appropriate label is Support.
</think>

The citations support the factors mentioned by providing evidence from previous studies. Each citation backs up a specific factor influencing plant health. 

Support
