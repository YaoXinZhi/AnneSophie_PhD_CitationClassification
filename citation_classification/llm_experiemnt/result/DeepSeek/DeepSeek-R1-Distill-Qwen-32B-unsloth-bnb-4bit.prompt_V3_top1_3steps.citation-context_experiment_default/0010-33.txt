Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. The passage says, "The taxonomic status of these species is problematic and some may not develop on Pyrus @@CITATION@@." 

First, I'll look at what the context is saying. The sentence is pointing out that there's an issue with the taxonomic status of some pear species, suggesting that their development on Pyrus might be questionable. The citation here is referencing a previous study, probably the one where the species were described. 

Now, considering the intent, the current authors are using this citation to criticize or question the previous findings. They're pointing out that the taxonomic status is problematic, which indicates they're noting a weakness in the cited work. 

Looking at the predefined classes, the one that fits this situation is "Weakness" because the citation is being used to highlight limitations or issues in the previous study.

The citation is used to question the taxonomic status and developmental potential of species, highlighting a limitation in the cited work.
