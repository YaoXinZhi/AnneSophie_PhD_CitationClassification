Okay, I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in this passage. Let's start by reading the context.

The sentences around the citation are:
"Diseases caused by phytopathogens are a major concern for sustainable agricultural production. Previous studies have shown that environmental factors, especially temperature and humidity, significantly affect the incidence of plant diseases and consequently impact crop yield."

So, the citation is mentioning previous studies on how environmental factors affect plant disease incidence. The context is that the passage is stating that these factors are a concern and providing support from previous research.

Looking at the definitions, Support refers to when the citation is used to confirm or back up the current authors' findings or statements. Here, the citation is cited as evidence for the claim about environmental factors' impact on diseases.

Therefore, the rhetorical class should be Support.

The citation is used to support the current claim by referencing previous research, so the appropriate label is Support.

  "label": "Support"
