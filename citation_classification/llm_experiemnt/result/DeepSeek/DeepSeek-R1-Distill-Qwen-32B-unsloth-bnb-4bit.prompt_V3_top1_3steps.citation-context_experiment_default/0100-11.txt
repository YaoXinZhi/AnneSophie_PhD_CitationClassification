Okay, let's tackle this step by step. I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context into a specific rhetorical class from the predefined list. 

First, I'll extract the context discussing the citation. The passage mentions that the authors observed a decrease in the population of the invasive species, referencing Wei et al., 2004, and also cite another study by Saracco et al., 2006, which reported conflicting results. The context is about two studies showing differing findings regarding the population of an invasive species.

Next, I'll identify the general intent. The citation is used to point out conflicting results between two studies. The authors are contrasting the findings of Wei et al. with Saracco et al. This suggests a comparative intent, specifically comparing two studies not against their own work but with each other.

Now, looking at the rhetorical classes, CoCoXY is defined as comparing two cited studies with each other regarding explanations or claims. This fits because the passage is directly comparing the results of Wei et al. and Saracco et al., showing conflicting results without relating them to the current paper's findings.

So, the most appropriate class here is CoCoXY.
