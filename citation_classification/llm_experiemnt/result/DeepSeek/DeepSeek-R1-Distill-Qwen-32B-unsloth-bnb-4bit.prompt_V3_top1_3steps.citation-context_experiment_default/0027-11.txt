Alright, so I have to assign a rhetorical class to the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I need to extract the context from the passage. The passage I'm looking at is: "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@." 

Looking at this, the context is about the spread of magnetic water treatment devices in the USA starting from 1975. The citation is tagged here, so I need to understand why it's being cited. 

Next, I identify the general intent of the citation. The sentence is stating a fact about the spread of these devices without any indication of comparison, support, or criticism. It's simply providing information. 

Now, matching this to the predefined classes. The passage isn't comparing anything (so not CoCoGM, CoCoRes, or CoCoXY), nor is it motivating, suggesting future work, supporting, or pointing out a weakness. It's not using a method or dataset from another work either. Instead, it's just stating a factual piece of information, which fits the "Neutral" category. 

Therefore, the most appropriate label is "Neutral."
