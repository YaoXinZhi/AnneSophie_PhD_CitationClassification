Alright, I need to analyze the context provided to determine the correct rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@. 

First, looking at the context: The passage uses @@CITATION@@ to reference a previous study that supports the finding that a small aphid gut binding peptide can hinder enamovirus uptake. The researchers also mention that the peptide binds to gut epithelia in other aphid species, suggesting broader applicability.

Step 1: Extract the context. The context is about supporting the current study's finding with a previous study, showing similar results.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. Since the citation is used to back up the current findings, the intent is supportive.

Step 3: Select the specific rhetorical class. Among the options, 'Support' is the most appropriate because the citation is confirming the current study's results with previous work.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The context states that the cited work supports the current finding that a small aphid gut binding peptide interferes with enamovirus uptake and binds to gut epithelia.
2. The general intent is to support the current research's findings with previous work.
3. The specific rhetorical class is 'Support' as it's used to confirm the findings.

"Support"
