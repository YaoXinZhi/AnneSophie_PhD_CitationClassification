Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class of the citation in the given passage. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the context is discussing the formation of hard calcite scales on surfaces exposed to hard water and how they're prevented using a magnetic field. The citation mentioned is their previous work, which showed successful prevention. The current purpose is to understand the mechanism behind this. 

So, the general intent here seems to be explaining why this research is being done. They're pointing out that while their previous work demonstrated the prevention, the explanation for why it works is still unknown. This is establishing the motivation for their current study.

Looking at the definitions, "Motivation" is when the citation is used to justify why the current research is conducted, like identifying a knowledge gap. In this case, the lack of explanation is the gap they're addressing. 

Therefore, the rhetorical class should be Motivation.

Step 1: The context uses the citation to explain why the current research is conducted, pointing out a knowledge gap in understanding the mechanism behind the magnetic treatment's effect.

Step 2: The general intent is to identify a knowledge gap, which is Motivational.

Step 3: The specific rhetorical class is Motivation.
