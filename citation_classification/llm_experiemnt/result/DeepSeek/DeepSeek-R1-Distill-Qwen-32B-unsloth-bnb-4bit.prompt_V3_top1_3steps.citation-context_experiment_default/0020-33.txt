Alright, let me try to figure out how to classify this citation. So, the task is to assign one of the predefined rhetorical classes to a citation @@CITATION@@ based on its context in the passage.

First, I need to extract the exact context where the citation is used. Let me look for the part of the passage that includes @@CITATION@@. Hmm, the context is: "In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@@."

Next, I have to identify the general intent of the citation. The mention here is that the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages, similar to the research cited. The authors are pointing out that other studies have shown similar findings. So, they're using the citation to show that their results are consistent with prior work.

Now, mapping this to the predefined classes. The general intent is supportive because they're confirming their findings with another study. Looking deeper, the specific class would be 'Similar' since they're pointing out that their results are supported by another research showing cross-taxon investigations in similar contexts.

So, putting it all together, the citation is used to show similarity with another study, which fits the 'Similar' category.
</think>

Step 1: The context is discussing cross-taxon investigations where the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages, citing previous findings.

Step 2: The intent is to show similarity and corroborate findings with another study.

Step 3: The most appropriate class is Similar.
