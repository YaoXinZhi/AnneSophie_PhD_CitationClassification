Okay, I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. Let's go through the steps.

First, extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the formation of hard calcite scale on surfaces exposed to hard water can be prevented with a magnetic field, as shown in their previous research. The current work aims to understand the mechanism behind this effect.

Next, identify the general intent. The citation is explaining why this research is being conducted because it's building on previous findings, so the intent is motivational.

Looking at the options, Motivation fits because the citation justifies the current research by pointing to a previous study that found a phenomenon needing explanation.

So, the rhetorical class is Motivation.
