Okay, I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me go through the steps.

First, I extract the context around the citation. The sentence is: "In the USA, the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@." It's a factual statement about the spread of magnetic water treatment devices in the USA without any implications or comparison.

Next, identifying the general intent. The citation is presented neutrally, just providing a fact without supporting, comparing, or critiquing anything. So it's descriptive.

Looking at the rhetorical classes, the most appropriate is Neutral since it's a straightforward mention without any specific argumentative role.
