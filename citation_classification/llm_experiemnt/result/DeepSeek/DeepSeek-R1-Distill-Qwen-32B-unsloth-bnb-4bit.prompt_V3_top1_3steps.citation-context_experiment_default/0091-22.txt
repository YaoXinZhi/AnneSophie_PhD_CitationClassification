Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given plant health passage. Let me start by extracting the context around the citation. The passage says: "Recent studies have shown that the distribution of plant parasitic nematodes is influenced by soil temperature and moisture. @@CITATION@@ has demonstrated that...". 

Hmm, looking at the context, the citation is referencing a study that showed the influence of soil factors on nematodes. The author here is using this citation to support their point about the distribution of nematodes. So, the intent seems to be to back up their statement with evidence. 

Now, looking at the possible classes, "Support" is when the citation is used to confirm or back up the author's findings. The example given for Support is when a previous study's results align with the current work. Here, the author is directly citing a study to support their claim about nematode distribution. 

I don't think it's a comparison because there's no contrast or mention of another study. It's not a usage since they're not using a method or tool from the cited work. It's also not a motivation or future research direction. So the most fitting class is Support.
</think>

Step 1: The context mentions that a recent study showed the influence of soil factors on nematodes, and the citation supports this point.

Step 2: The citation is used to support the author's claim about nematode distribution.

Step 3: The appropriate label is Support.
