Okay, I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. 

Step 1: Extract the context. The passage talks about hard calcite scale formation on surfaces exposed to hard water and how magnetic fields prevent it. The citation is mentioned in the motivation for the current study.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The study is conducted because previous research showed that magnetic fields prevent scale formation, so it's trying to explain why. This fits into the Motivation category because it's justifying the current research by pointing out a knowledge gap.

Step 3: Select the specific class. Since it's justifying the study by referring to previous work, the label should be Motivation.

The citation is used to explain why the current research is being conducted by referencing prior findings. 

**Motivation**
