Alright, I'm trying to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. The passage says, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." 

Step 1: Extract the context. The sentence is comparing the results of the present work with those from @@CITATION@@. The key point is "substantially differ," indicating a contrast in findings.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation is used to compare results, which falls under Comparative. 

Step 3: Select the specific label. Since it's comparing the results directly with another study, the appropriate label is CoCoRes.

CoCoRes
