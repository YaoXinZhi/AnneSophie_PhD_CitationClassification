Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me break down the process step by step.

First, I'll look at the context provided. The surrounding sentences are:

"Plants often rely on mycorrhizal fungi to obtain sufficient phosphorus, and the majority of wild plant species form such symbioses with either AM fungi or Ericoid mycorrhizal fungi (ERF) which are found in species of the Ericaceae family @@CITATION@@. The presence of ER symbioses is a major determinant of plant success and species distribution in acidic, low-P soils @@CITATION@@."

The citation @@CITATION@@ is tagged here. My task is to understand what role this citation plays.

Next, I should extract the context around the citation. The sentences are discussing the role of mycorrhizal fungi in plants, specifically AM fungi and Ericoid mycorrhizal fungi (ERF) in Ericaceae species. The citation comes right after this general statement.

Now, step two is to identify the general intent. The passage is providing a general fact about plant species and their symbioses. The citation is cited just after this statement, so it's likely serving to support or confirm the information given in the text.

Looking at the possible rhetorical classes, "Support" is when the citation is used to back up the work or findings of the current paper. The sentence before the citation introduces a fact, and the citation seems to be backing that up with existing research.

I don't think it's "Basis" because it's not laying the foundation for current research methods or theories. It doesn't compare with other works, so it's not a comparison class like CoCoRes or CoCoGM. It's not pointing out a gap or future direction, so not Motivation or Future. It's also not critical or neutral; it's clearly supporting the statement.

Therefore, the most appropriate class here is "Support."
