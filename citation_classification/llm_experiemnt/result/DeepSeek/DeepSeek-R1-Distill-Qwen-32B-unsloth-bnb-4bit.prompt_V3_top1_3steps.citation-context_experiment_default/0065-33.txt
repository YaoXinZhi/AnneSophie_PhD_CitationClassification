Okay, I need to evaluate the given scientific passage and determine the rhetorical class of the citation @@CITATION@@. Let's start by understanding the context and the citation's role within it.

The passage discusses the development of methods to estimate aboveground biomass in plantations using allometric equations. It mentions that these methods are rooted in the theoretical and empirical work of a referenced study ( @@CITATION@@ ). Additionally, it notes that the equations are based on tree diameter and height measurements collected non-destructively.

First, I extract the context surrounding the citation. The citation is used to establish the foundation of the methods employed. The authors are referring to prior research that provided the necessary theoretical framework and empirical foundation for their current work. This indicates that the cited work serves as a basis for their methods.

Next, I identify the general intent. Since the citation is establishing foundational research that the current study builds upon, the intent is foundational. This aligns with the "Basis" category, which refers to intellectual foundation.

Looking at the predefined classes, "Basis" is the most appropriate here because it directly refers to the cited work providing the theoretical and empirical underpinnings for the current research methods.
