Okay, so I need to figure out how to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. The task is to assign the most appropriate rhetorical class from a list provided. First, I should extract the context where the citation is used. 

Looking at the passage, it says, "Our previous research @@CITATION@@ has shown that the formation of the hard calcite scale on the surfaces exposed to hard water can be successfully prevented with the applied magnetic field. The explanation of the phenomena is not yet offered and the purpose of this work is to try to understand the mechanism of the beneficial influence of the magnetic treatment."

Hmm, so the citation is referring to their own previous research. They mention that previous work showed that magnetic fields prevent calcite scale formation. Now, their current work aims to explain why that happens. This seems like they're using the citation to explain why they're doing the current research, because there's a gap in understanding the mechanism.

Looking at the general intent categories, this fits under "Motivation" because they're citing their past work to justify the current research's purpose. The example they provided under Motivation was similar: using a citation to show a knowledge gap and the need for further research.

So, the specific rhetorical class here is Motivation because they're motivating their current study by pointing out that the previous findings need an explanation that wasn't provided before.
