Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to assign a rhetorical class label to the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific article passage. The process has three steps: extract the context, identify the general intent, and then select the specific class. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage provided is about plant health, specifically the occurrence of pathogenic bacteria. The sentence says that the occurrence of P. pyogenes was higher on stems with canker symptoms compared to healthy stems, as previously reported @@CITATION@@. 

Next, I should identify the general intent of the citation. The sentence is supporting or confirming the current finding by referencing a prior study. The use of "as previously reported" suggests that the cited work is backing up the current result. 

Now, looking at the predefined classes, this seems to fall under 'Support'. The citation is used to confirm or support the finding that P. pyogenes occurrence is higher on stems with canker symptoms. The example given for 'Support' also uses similar phrasing, saying that previous research supports the current findings, which matches this scenario.
</think>

The context discusses a finding supported by prior research, using the citation to confirm results. This aligns with the 'Support' class, which refers to citations backing up current findings.
