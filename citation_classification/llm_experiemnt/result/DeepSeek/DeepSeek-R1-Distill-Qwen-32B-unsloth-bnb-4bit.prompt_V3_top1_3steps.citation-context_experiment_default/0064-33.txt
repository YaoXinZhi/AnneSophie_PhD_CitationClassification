Okay, I need to classify the rhetorical class of a citation in a plant health article. Let me start by extracting the context around @@CITATION@@. Looking at the passage, it's talking about the effect of magnetic treatment on calcite scale prevention. The authors mention their previous work that showed prevention but not the mechanism. 

Next, I'll determine the general intent. They're using the citation to explain the motivation behind their current research. They found that it works but don't know why, so they're using the prior study to justify their investigation.

Now, selecting the specific class. Since the citation is explaining why they're conducting this research, the class is Motivation.

The passage discusses a previous study that demonstrated the effectiveness of magnetic treatment in preventing calcite scale formation. The current research is motivated by the absence of an explanation for this phenomenon. The citation serves to justify the current study's purpose.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The context shows the citation is prior work on magnetic treatment effectiveness.
2. The intent is to explain why the current research is conducted.
3. The citation is used to identify a knowledge gap for the current study.

**Motivation**
