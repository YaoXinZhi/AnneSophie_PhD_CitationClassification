Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by extracting the context.

The passage says: "Our work builds on previous studies of insect gut microbiomes @@CITATION@@, which have identified hundreds of bacterial species and shown their importance in host nutrition, immune responses, and defense mechanisms." 

Now, I'll analyze this step by step.

First, looking at the context, the citation is introducing previous studies that the current work builds upon. It mentions that these studies have identified many bacterial species and shown their importance in various host functions. This seems like it's establishing the foundation for the current research.

Next, identifying the general intent. Since it's referencing previous studies to establish what has already been done, it's serving as the intellectual foundation or basis for the current work. That points toward the "Basis" category.

To confirm, Basis is for citing foundational work that the current research is built upon. The example given for Basis is about introducing a study that the authors build on, which aligns perfectly with this passage.

Therefore, the rhetorical class is "Basis."

The citation introduces foundational studies that the current work builds upon, establishing the basis for their research.

**Step-by-step explanation:**

1. **Extracted Context:** The current work is built on previous studies by @@CITATION@@, which identified bacterial species and their role in host functions.

2. **General Intent:** Foundational, as it references prior work forming the basis of current research.

3. **Specific Rhetorical Class:** Basis

**Answer:** Basis
