Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in this scientific passage. First, I'll look at the context provided. The passage mentions a study where they applied magnetic fields to prevent scale formation and now they're trying to understand the mechanism. The citation is linked to previous research that showed the prevention of scale using magnetic fields. 

So, Step 1 is to extract the context. The context is that the current study builds on previous work, citing that they replicated the results and now aim to explain the mechanism. 

Moving to Step 2, I need to identify the general intent. The citation is used to justify why they're conducting this current research because the previous study found a phenomenon without explaining it. That sounds like the Motivation class because it's pointing out a knowledge gap. The study is being conducted to address an open question from prior work.

For Step 3, selecting the specific label. Between Motivation and others, since it's about why they're doing the research, Motivation fits. It's not a comparison, support, or usage; it's about the reason behind the study.

So, the label should be "Motivation".
