Okay, let me figure out how to assign the correct rhetorical class to the citation in the given passage. First, I'll look at the context around @@CITATION@@. The passage mentions that earlier studies have explored similar aspects, and the citation is included in this discussion. It seems like the authors are pointing out that their current findings align with previous research. 

This makes me think that the general intent of the citation is to show support or similarity between the cited work and the current study. The authors are likely using the citation to back up their results by indicating that others have observed similar phenomena.

Now, considering the specific rhetorical classes, the passage doesn't seem to be using the citation for comparison (which would be CoCoGM, CoCoRes, or CoCoXY), nor is it for motivation, future directions, usage, weakness, or a neutral mention. Instead, it's clearly highlighting that their results are consistent with existing studies, which points towards the "Similar" category.

So, the citation is used to show that the current work's findings are similar to those of the cited study, indicating a shared pattern or result. Therefore, the appropriate label should be "Similar."
