Okay, so I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific article passage into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. Let me go through the process step by step.

First, I look at the passage. The context provided is: "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@."

Step 1: Extract the context discussing the citation. The sentence seems to be a neutral statement about the spread of magnetic water treatment devices in the USA since 1975, and it uses the citation right after.

Step 2: Identify the general intent of the citation. The context doesn't indicate that the citation is being used to compare methods, results, or anything else. It's just a factual statement citing a source that provides information on this spread. There's no comparison, support, criticism, or motivation implied.

Step 3: Select the specific rhetorical class. Since the citation is used in a neutral way to support a factual statement without any comparison, support, or criticism, the most appropriate label is Neutral.

I don't see any elements of comparison (like CoCoGM, CoCoRes, or CoCoXY), support, weakness, motivation, future, or usage of a method. It's purely descriptive, so Neutral is the correct classification.
