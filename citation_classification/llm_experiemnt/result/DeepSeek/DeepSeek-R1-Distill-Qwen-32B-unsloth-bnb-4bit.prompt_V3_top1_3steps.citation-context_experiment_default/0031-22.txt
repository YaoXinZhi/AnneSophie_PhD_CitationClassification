Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation marked as @@CITATION@@. Let's break down the context given. The passage mentions that the citation references a study showing the multiplication of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains in different parts of infected daisy plants. However, it also points out that conflicting results were reported for another phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima. 

First, I extract the context around the citation. It's comparing two studies: one that found fast multiplication rates and another with conflicting results. So the citation is being used to highlight a discrepancy between these two pieces of research.

Next, I look at the general intent. The passage is comparing the results or findings of the cited work with each other, not with the current paper. The key here is that they're being contrasted as two studies with differing outcomes.

Now, looking at the rhetorical classes, this fits under CoCoXY. CoCoXY specifically refers to situations where two cited studies are compared or contrasted with each other, rather than with the citing paper itself. Since the citation is showing conflicting results between two studies, this is exactly the use case for CoCoXY.

So, putting it all together, the citation is used to compare two studies, highlighting their conflicting results. Therefore, the appropriate rhetorical class is CoCoXY.
