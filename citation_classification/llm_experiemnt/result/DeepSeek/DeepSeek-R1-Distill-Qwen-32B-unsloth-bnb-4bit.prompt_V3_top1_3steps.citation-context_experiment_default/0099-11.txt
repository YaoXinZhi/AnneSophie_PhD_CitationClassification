Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me first extract the context. The passage says that the citation is talking about eighteen species collected on cultivated and wild pear in China. It adds that the taxonomic status of these species is problematic, and some may not develop on Pyrus.

Now, I need to determine the general intent of why this citation is included. The passage mentions that the species' taxonomic status is problematic and questions their development on Pyrus. This seems like the citing paper is pointing out that something about the cited work might not be correct or complete. So, it's questioning the cited paper's findings.

Looking at the predefined classes, the rhetorical class that fits this is 'Weakness'. That's because the citation is used to criticize or point out a limitation in the cited work, specifically the taxonomic issues and uncertainties about where the species develop. The paper is drawing attention to potential flaws or uncertainties in the cited research.

The citation discusses problematic taxonomic status of species described, indicating a limitation or flaw, thus using the citation to point out a weakness.
