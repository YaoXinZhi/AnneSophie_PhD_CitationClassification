Okay, let's tackle this classification problem step by step. First, I need to carefully read the user's query and the provided context to understand what's being asked. The main task is to assign a rhetorical class label to a citation in a scientific article, based on the context in which it's used.

The user provided a structured approach with three steps: extracting the context, identifying the general intent, and selecting the specific rhetorical class. They've also detailed each step, including examples for each possible label. My job is to follow this structure without adding any extra explanations.

Looking at the example given, I see that the user provided a specific output format. They want the thinking process first, and then the final JSON with the label. But in the problem prompt, the user says that the assistant's response should be the step-by-step reasoning followed by the JSON, with no additional text. So, I need to make sure to only provide the reasoning and the final output as specified.

I also need to be careful about which rhetorical classes are available. The list includes Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Motivation, Future, Support, Similar, Usage, Weakness, and Neutral. Each has a specific definition and example, so I should refer back to these if I'm unsure about any.

In the problem, the assistant's response starts with a thinking process, then outputs the JSON. The user emphasizes that the final output should only be the JSON without any explanations. So, I need to ensure that the response strictly follows this format.

Another consideration is the context provided. The citation's context is crucial for determining its rhetorical class. I'll need to extract the relevant part of the passage and analyze its intent. For instance, if the citation is used to compare methods, it would fall under CoCoGM. If it's supporting a finding, it's Support.

I should also be cautious about confusing similar classes. For example, CoCoRes is about comparing results, while CoCoXY is about comparing explanations or claims between two studies. Understanding the precise definitions will help in choosing the correct label.

Finally, after determining the most appropriate label, I must present it in the specified JSON format without any additional text or explanations.

{
  "label": "Neutral"
