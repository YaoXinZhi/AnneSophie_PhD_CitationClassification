Okay, I need to determine the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let's start by carefully reading the passage and extracting the relevant context around the citation.

The passage says: "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly [...] is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@@."

From this, it looks like the authors are citing another study that supports their own findings. The cited work shows a similar result where the host influenced bacterial communities, which aligns with the current study's findings.

Next, I need to identify the general intent of the citation. The authors are using it to back up their own results, so that's supportive. Now, looking at the specific classes, "Support" is exactly when a citation is used to confirm or back up the citing authors' work.

There's no mention of comparing methods, contrasting results, or any criticismâ€”just a supporting reference. So the most appropriate class is "Support."

The context uses the citation to support the authors' findings by referencing a similar study, aligning with the "Support" class.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Extract Context:** The citation supports the current finding with a similar study.
2. **General Intent:** Supportive, as it backs up the current research.
3. **Specific Class:** "Support" because it confirms the authors' results.

**Answer:** Support
