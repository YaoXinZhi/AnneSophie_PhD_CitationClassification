Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me start by carefully reading the context to understand how the citation is being used.

The context is: "The specific application of magnetic treatment in preventing scale formation on hard water-exposed surfaces was first demonstrated in our previous work @@CITATION@@ and further explored in this study."

First, in Step 1, I extract the context around the citation. The sentence mentions that the application of magnetic treatment was first demonstrated in their previous work and is now being further explored. So the citation refers to their own earlier research.

Step 2 is identifying the general intent. The citation is referring to a foundational study that the current work builds upon. It's establishing that they were the first to demonstrate this application, setting the basis for the current research.

Step 3 is selecting the specific rhetorical class. The example given for Basis is when the citation references the intellectual foundation of the current research. Here, the previous work is the basis for the current study, so the rhetorical class should be Basis.
