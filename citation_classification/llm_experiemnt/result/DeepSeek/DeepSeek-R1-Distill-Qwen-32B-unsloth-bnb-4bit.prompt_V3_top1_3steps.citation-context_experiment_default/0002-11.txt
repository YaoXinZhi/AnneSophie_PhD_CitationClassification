Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in the given scientific article passage. Let me go through the steps carefully.

First, I need to extract the context that discusses the citation @@CITATION@@. The passage mentions that the citation is referenced in a context where it's showing the multiplication rates and concentration of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains in infected daisy plants. The passage also notes conflicting results described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima.

So, the context is about comparing two studies. The first study by Wei et al., 2004, and Saracco et al., 2006, reported fast multiplication and high concentration. However, the citation in question describes conflicting results for a different phytoplasma in a different plant.

Now, looking at the general intent, this seems to be a comparison between two studies. The citing paper is highlighting that while one set of studies found certain results, another study (the cited one) found conflicting results.

Looking at the predefined rhetorical classes, this fits into CoCoXY because it's comparing or contrasting the explanations or claims of two cited studies with each other, not with the citing paper's results. Here, the cited work is being used to show a discrepancy between different studies, which is a comparative use but between two cited works rather than directly with the current paper's findings.

So, the specific rhetorical class here is CoCoXY.
