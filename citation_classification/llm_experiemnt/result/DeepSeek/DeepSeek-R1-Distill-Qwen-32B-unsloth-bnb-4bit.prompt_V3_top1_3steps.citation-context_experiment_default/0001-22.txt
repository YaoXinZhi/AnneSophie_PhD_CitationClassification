Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me go through the process step by step.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the taxonomic status of certain species is problematic, and that some may not develop on Pyrus, citing @@CITATION@@. 

Next, I'll identify the general intent. Here, the authors are pointing out that the cited work's findings are problematic or flawed in some way. They're highlighting that there's uncertainty or issues with the classification of these species.

Now, looking at the predefined classes, this seems to fit into the "Weakness" category. The citation is used to criticize or question the cited work's findings, pointing out limitations or flaws in the taxonomic status as described by the cited authors.
