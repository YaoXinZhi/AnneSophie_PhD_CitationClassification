Okay, I need to determine the rhetorical class of the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me follow the steps.

First, I'll extract the context discussing the citation. The passage mentions that the cited work showed how plant-parasitic nematodes respond to specific stimuli, and the authors are expanding on that by considering additional chemical cues. 

Next, I'll identify the general intent. The authors are using the cited work to support their own research by building upon previous findings. They highlight that their work is an extension of the cited study, indicating a supportive intent.

Now, looking at the specific rhetorical classes, "Support" seems appropriate because they are using the citation to confirm or back up their approach. They are not comparing or critiquing, just building on existing work.
