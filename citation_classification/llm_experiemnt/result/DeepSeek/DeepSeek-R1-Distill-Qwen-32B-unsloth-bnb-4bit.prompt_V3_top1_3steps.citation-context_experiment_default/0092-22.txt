Okay, so I need to determine the rhetorical class for the citation in the given context. Let me see... The task is to follow the steps outlined.

First, I'll extract the context discussing the citation. The example given is: "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@@."

Hmm, the context mentions that their finding is "supported by recent cross-taxon investigations," which suggests that the cited work backs up their results. So they're using the citation to support their own findings.

Next, I need to identify the general intent. This seems to be supportive because the citation is used to back up their results. Looking at the predefined classes, 'Support' is for when the citation supports the current work's results or findings.

So, the specific rhetorical class would be 'Support' because the citation is used to confirm their findings with previous research.

I don't think it's any of the other classes. It's not comparing their methods or results directly to their own, so it's not CoCoGM or CoCoRes. It's not introducing a foundational concept, so not Basis. They're not pointing out a limitation or weakness. It's just supporting their own results with prior work.

So the label should be 'Support'.
