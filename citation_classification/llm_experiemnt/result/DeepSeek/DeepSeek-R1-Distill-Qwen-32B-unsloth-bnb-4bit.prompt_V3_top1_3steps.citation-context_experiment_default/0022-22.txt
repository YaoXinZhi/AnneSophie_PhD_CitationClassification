Alright, let's tackle this classification task. The citation is labeled "@@CITATION@@", and I need to extract the context, determine the general intent, and assign the most appropriate rhetorical class.

First, looking at Step 1, I extract the context. The example provided is about aphids and a study showing how a peptide interferes with virus uptake. It mentions the potential broader applicability.

Next, Step 2 is to identify the general intent. This looks like it's suggesting future directions for research, as it points to broader applicability beyond the current study.

Finally, Step 3 requires selecting the specific label. Since it's implying future research, "Future" is the right category.
</think>

The citation is used to suggest future research possibilities, indicating the potential broader applicability of the peptide's effect across different aphid species. This implies directions for future studies.

#OUTPUT

Future
