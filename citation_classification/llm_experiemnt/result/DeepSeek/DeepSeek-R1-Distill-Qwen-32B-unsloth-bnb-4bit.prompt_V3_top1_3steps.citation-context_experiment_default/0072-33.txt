Okay, let's try to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. First, I need to extract the context discussing the citation. The context provided is: "Fast multiplication rates and high concentration of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains have been reported in young developing leaves and roots of infected daisy plants  (Wei et al., 2004; Saracco et al., 2006), although conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima @@CITATION@@."

So, the sentence mentions Wei et al. and Saracco et al. as having reported certain findings. Then it mentions that conflicting results were described by @@CITATION@@. The key here is that two studies are being contrasted or compared with each other. The @@CITATION@@ is being used to show a discrepancy in results between the cited work (Wei et al. and Saracco et al.) and another study.

Looking at the definitions, this seems to fit into the CoCoXY category because that's where the citations are used to compare or contrast two cited studies with each other, not directly with the citing paper. The example given for CoCoXY also talks about conflicting results between two studies, similar to what's happening here.

So, the context is highlighting a comparison between results from different studies, which points to the CoCoXY rhetorical class.
