Okay, I'm faced with a task where I need to classify a citation in a scientific article into a specific rhetorical class. Let me first understand the requirements.

The citation is tagged as @@CITATION@@, and I have to look at the context around it to determine why it's cited. The predefined classes are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Motivation, Future, Support, Similar, Usage, Weakness, and Neutral.

Step 1: Extract the context around @@CITATION@@. I need to focus on the sentences immediately before and after the citation to understand its role.

Suppose the context is something like: "Previous studies have shown that magnetic fields can influence plant growth. @@CITATION@@ reported significant increases in crop yields under certain magnetic conditions. Our research extends these findings by examining the underlying mechanisms."

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation is being used to support the existing findings, showing that their previous work is in line with others, which is supportive.

Step 3: Choose the specific rhetorical class. Since it's supporting their work by referencing another study, the label is "Support."

The citation is used to support the authors' findings by referencing a previous study that corroborates their results.

**Step-by-step explanation:**

1. **Extract Context:** The citation is part of a sentence supporting current findings with previous research.
2. **Determine Intent:** The intent is to back up the current work with established results.
3. **Classify:** This is a "Support" because it confirms the work of the citing authors.

**ANSWER**
Support
