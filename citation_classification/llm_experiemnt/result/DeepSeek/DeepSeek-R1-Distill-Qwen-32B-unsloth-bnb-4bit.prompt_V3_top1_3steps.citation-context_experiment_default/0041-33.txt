Okay, I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me first extract the context around the citation.

The passage is about the replication of experiments from @@CITATION@@ to test human-like biases in word embeddings. The authors mention that these experiments are similar to their previous work but focus on detection rather than debiasing.

Now, I need to figure out the intent. The citation is being used to compare the current work with the cited work. They're highlighting that their research is complementary, focusing on different aspects. So, it's a type of comparison.

Looking at the rhetorical classes, CoCoGM is for comparing goals or methods. Here, the authors are contrasting their approach (detection) with the cited work's (debiasing). Therefore, the correct class is CoCoGM.
