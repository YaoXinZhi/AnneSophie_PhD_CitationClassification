Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific passage into one of the predefined rhetorical classes.

First, I'll look at the context provided: "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@@."

Step 1: Extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that their findings about insect hosts influencing bacterial assembly are supported by recent studies on other insects. The citation is referring to a specific study about fleas and ticks where the arthropod host was the main factor affecting bacterial assemblages.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The authors are using the cited study to back up their own findings. They're not comparing methodologies or goals, nor are they suggesting future directions or justifying their research. Instead, they're confirming their results with another study.

Step 3: Assign the specific rhetorical class. Since the citation is supporting their results by referencing another study's findings, it fits under the "Support" category.
</think>

The citation supports the current study's findings by referencing another study's results. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
1. The context shows that the citation supports their findings with another study.
2. The general intent is to confirm their results.
3. The specific rhetorical class is Support.

**Answer:** Support
