Okay, so I need to classify the rhetorical class of a citation in a scientific article. Let me look at the problem step by step.

First, the user provided a context and a task. The task is to assign a rhetorical class to a citation in a passage. The predefined classes are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Motivation, Future, Support, Similar, Usage, Weakness, and Neutral.

The context given is an excerpt from a scientific article that talks about a study on the impact of glyphosate on beneficial soil bacteria. The citation @@CITATION@@ is mentioned within this context.

Looking at the context, the passage discusses that glyphosate has various effects on soil microbes and that a previous study found its use leads to a significant reduction in beneficial bacteria. The citation here is used to support the current argument by referencing a previous finding.

So, according to the step-by-step process:

1. Extract the context discussing the citation. The context is about supporting the current research by referencing prior findings on glyphosate's effects.

2. Identify the general intent. The citation is used to support the argument made by the current authors.

3. Select the specific rhetorical class. The Support class is about using a citation to back up the current work's claims or findings.

Thus, the most appropriate label here is "Support" because the citation is supporting the current study's findings by referencing earlier work.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Extract Context:** The citation supports the current research by referencing a previous study on glyphosate's impact.
2. **Identify Intent:** The citation is used to support the current argument.
3. **Select Class:** The support class fits as it references prior work to back up findings.

**Output:**

"Support"
