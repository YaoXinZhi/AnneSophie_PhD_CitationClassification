Okay, I need to determine the rhetorical class of the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. 

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage says that researchers found two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains with high multiplication rates in young leaves and roots of infected daisy plants, citing Wei et al., 2004 and Saracco et al., 2006. However, conflicting results were noted for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima, citing @@CITATION@@.

So, the context is about comparing results from two studies (Wei et al. and Saracco et al.) and then mentioning conflicting results from another study (cited as @@CITATION@@).

The general intent here seems to be comparing the cited works with each other, not directly with the citing paper. This points towards a comparative intent. Within the comparative classes, the specific situation is comparing the explanations or claims of the cited studies. 

Therefore, the appropriate rhetorical class is CoCoXY, which deals with comparisons of explanations or claims between two cited studies.

The citation is comparing conflicting results from two studies, highlighting the difference in their findings about phytoplasmas. This is a comparison of their explanations or claims.

**Step-by-step explanation:**
1. The context discusses conflicting results between two studies, which are cited in the passage.
2. The general intent is to compare the cited studies' results or explanations.
3. This falls under the comparative category, specifically CoCoXY, as it involves comparing the explanations or claims of two cited works.

#Output
CoCoXY
