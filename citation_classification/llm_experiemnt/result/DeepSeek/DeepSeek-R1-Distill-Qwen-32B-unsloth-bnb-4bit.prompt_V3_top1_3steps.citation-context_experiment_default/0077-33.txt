Okay, so I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by extracting the context around the citation to understand its role in the passage. 

The passage mentions that a previous study by @@CITATION@@ showed that a magnetic field can prevent hard calcite scale formation, but the explanation wasn't offered. The current work aims to understand the mechanism. 

This context suggests that the citation is justifying why the current research is being conducted because it points out a gap in the previous study. Therefore, the general intent is Motivational. 

Looking at the specific classes under Motivation, it's meant to identify a knowledge gap or open question. The example provided aligns with this because the current study is motivated by the lack of an explanation from the cited work.

So, the rhetorical class is Motivation.
</think>

The citation is used to justify the current research by highlighting a knowledge gap identified in previous work, thus serving a motivational role. 

#Step-by-step Explanation:
1. The passage uses the citation to indicate that a prior study showed results without explanation.
2. This omission motivates the current study's purpose.
3. Therefore, the intent is Motivational.

Final label: Motivation
