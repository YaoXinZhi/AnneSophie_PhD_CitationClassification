Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in the given passage about plant health. Let's go through each step.

First, I need to extract the relevant context surrounding the citation. The passage mentions that the study by XYZ (2010) found that magnetic treatment affects scale formation. It then says that this supports their own findings about the treatment's effectiveness.

Next, I have to determine the general intent of this citation. It seems like they're using XYZ's work to back up their own results, which leans towards a supportive intent.

Looking at the specific classes, 'Support' is when the citation is used to confirm or support the work of the current paper. Since their findings align with XYZ's research, this fits the 'Supportive' category.

I don't see any indication of comparison or motivation here; it's straightforward support. So the most appropriate label is 'Support'.
