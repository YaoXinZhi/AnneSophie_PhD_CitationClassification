Alright, let's break this down step by step. I need to assign the correct rhetorical class to the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific passage. 

First, I'll look at the context provided. The passage mentions that the study found a positive correlation between plant growth and the use of a specific fertilizer. It then states, "This finding supports previous research @@CITATION@@ which also reported similar results." 

So, Step 1: The context is that the current study's findings align with prior research. The citation is being used to show that their results are consistent with what others have found before.

Step 2: The general intent here seems to be supportive. The authors are citing to back up their results, indicating that others have found the same thing.

Step 3: Looking at the definitions, the appropriate label here should be 'Support'. This is because the citation is used to confirm their findings with previous work, fitting the example where similar results are cited to support the current study.

The citation @@CITATION@@ is used to support the current findings by referencing similar results from previous research.
