Okay, so I'm trying to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let's go through the steps.

First, I extract the context around the citation. It says, "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@. The present study extends this work by investigating the effects of magnetic treatment on the growth of calcite scales." 

Step two is identifying the general intent. The passage mentions that the set-up was described in detail before, which indicates that the current study is building on it. So, they're using the citation to reference a method or setup they're directly using in their current research.

Looking at the definitions, theUsage class is when the citation refers to a method or tool used in the current study. That fits here because they're using the previous setup as their method.

So, the most appropriate label is Usage.

The context discusses how the current study builds upon the cited work's method. The citation is directly used as a methodological foundation for the present research.
