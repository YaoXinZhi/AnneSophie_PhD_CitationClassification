Alright, so I need to assign a rhetorical class to a citation based on the provided context. Let me start by following the steps given.

First, I'll extract the context discussing the citation. The passage mentions using a particular method for analyzing plant diseases, referencing the citation and noting that the results are consistent with previous studies. This suggests the citation is supporting the current findings.

Next, identifying the general intent: Since the citation is used to show consistency with previous work, the intent seems supportive. It's not foundational, comparative, motivational, technical, critical, or neutral. It's about confirming the results.

Finally, selecting the specific rhetorical class. The context clearly supports the citing work's findings, so the most appropriate label is 'Support'.
