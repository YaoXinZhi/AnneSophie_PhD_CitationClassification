Okay, so I need to assign a rhetorical class to the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage about plant health. Let's start by reading the passage carefully.

The passage says, "The presence of beneficial bacteria in the rhizosphere of crop plants has been extensively studied @@CITATION@@. Our research builds upon these findings to explore the potential for microbial inoculants in sustainable agriculture." 

First, I'll extract the context. The main point here is that beneficial bacteria in the rhizosphere are studied, and this cited work is used as a foundation. The researchers are building upon these studies for their own work on microbial inoculants.

Next, identifying the intent. It seems like the citation is being used as an intellectual foundation. They're stating that their work is based on previous studies cited.

Looking at the rhetorical classes, 'Basis' fits here because it's referencing the foundation of the current research. It's not comparing methods or results, nor is it supporting claims or pointing out weaknesses. It's introducing the cited work as the basis for their study.

So the most appropriate label is 'Basis'.

Step 1: The context is that the citation is about the study of beneficial bacteria in the rhizosphere, which provides a foundation for the current research on microbial inoculants.

Step 2: The intent is foundational, as the cited work is used as the basis for the current study.

Step 3: The rhetorical class is Basis.
