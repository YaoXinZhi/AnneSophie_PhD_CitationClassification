Alright, I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage is about how the application of a magnetic field can prevent hard calcite scale formation, and the previous research has shown this but hasn't explained the mechanism. This current work aims to understand that mechanism.

Next, I'll determine the general intent of the citation. The study mentioned in @@CITATION@@ demonstrated that the magnetic treatment prevents scale formation. The current paper uses this as the motivation for their research because it identifies a prior finding and explains why the current study is necessaryâ€”to understand the underlying mechanism.

Looking at the predefined classes, the general intent here is Motivational. Specifically, the citation is used to point out a knowledge gap. The current work is being conducted because the previous research hasn't explained the mechanism. So, the specific rhetorical class is "Motivation".

I don't think it's any other class like Support or Basis because it's not directly supporting their claims or providing foundational theory. It's more about explaining why this study is important by referencing a previous finding.

The citation @@CITATION@@ is used to highlight a prior finding that the magnetic treatment prevents scale formation, serving as the motivation for the current study's purpose to understand the mechanism. The general intent is Motivational, specifically identifying a knowledge gap.
