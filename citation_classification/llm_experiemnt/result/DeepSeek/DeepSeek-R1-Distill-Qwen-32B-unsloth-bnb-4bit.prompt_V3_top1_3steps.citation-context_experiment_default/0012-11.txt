Alright, I need to determine the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. First, I'll extract the context surrounding the citation. The passage describes a study where the authors analyzed transcriptomic datasets and found that plant species respond to the apple replant disease with a stress response. They reference a previous study (Cai et al., 2016) that also observed a similar defense mechanism. 

Next, I'll identify the general intent. The authors are using the citation to support their own findings. They found a similar result, which means the citation is being used to back up their conclusion. This falls under a supportive intent.

Looking at the specific rhetorical classes, "Support" is the most appropriate. The citation is confirming the authors' results by referencing another study that found the same thing, which adds credibility to their findings. 

I don't think it's any of the other classes because they're not comparing methods or results directly, nor are they introducing a foundation or motivation. The citation is purely to back up their own conclusion with prior work.

The context mentions that both studies, including the cited work, observed a defense mechanism triggered by stress, supporting the current findings. Therefore, the rhetorical class is Support.
