Alright, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me start by understanding the context and the process I need to follow.

First, the task is to assign a rhetorical class to the citation. The predefined classes are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Motivation, Future, Support, Similar, Usage, Weakness, and Neutral.

I'm provided with a sample context: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." My job is to analyze this and determine the correct class.

Step 1: Extract the context discussing the citation. The context is "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." This sentence mentions that the experimental setup was detailed in a previous citation.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The context refers to a method or procedure used in a previous study. The citation is pointing to a prior work that provided the methodological details.

Step 3: Select the specific rhetorical class. Looking at the definitions:

- Usage: The citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup from the cited work that is used directly in the current study.

In this context, the citation is being used to reference a previous description of the experimental setup, which was used in the current research. This fits the Usage category because it's about using a prior method or setup.

I should make sure I'm not confusing this with Support or CoCoRes. Support is about confirming results, and CoCoRes is about comparing results. Here, it's about using the method, so Usage is accurate.
