Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand the context where the citation is used. The passage mentions that the presence of specific endophytes in certain plants is well-documented. The citation is referring to these well-known studies. So, the context is about acknowledging prior work that supports the current findings.

Next, I identify the general intent of the citation. Since the authors are pointing out that their findings align with existing studies, the intent is to support their work by referencing prior research. This suggests the citation is used to back up their points with established evidence.

Now, I need to select the specific rhetorical class. The options include Support, Similar, Motivation, etc. Since the authors are using the citation to confirm their results by referencing established studies, the appropriate class is Support. They're not comparing their work with others, nor are they just describing something neutrally or pointing out weaknesses. They're specifically using prior results to strengthen their own findings.
