Okay, I need to determine the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by understanding the context. The passage says, "The taxonomic status of these species is problematic and some may not develop on Pyrus @@CITATION@@." 

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The sentence mentions that the taxonomic status is problematic and some species may not develop on Pyrus. The citation is pointing out an issue with the classification or identification of these species.

Next, I need to identify the general intent. The statement is critical because it's pointing out a problem with the cited work. It's not comparing methods or results, nor is it supporting or motivating. It's highlighting a flaw or limitation in the cited study.

Looking at the predefined classes, the one that fits here is 'Weakness' because it's used to criticize or point out limitations in the cited work. The example given for 'Weakness' is similar: "Eighteen species... The taxonomic status... problematic..." which matches the context here.

So, the rhetorical class for this citation is 'Weakness'.
