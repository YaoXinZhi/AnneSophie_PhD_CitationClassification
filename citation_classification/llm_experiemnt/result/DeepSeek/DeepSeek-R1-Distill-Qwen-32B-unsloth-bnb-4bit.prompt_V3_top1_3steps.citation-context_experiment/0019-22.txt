Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in the given context. Let's start by understanding the context provided. The passage mentions that a specific study found conflicting results regarding the multiplication of 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains in daisy plants. It references two studies, Wei et al., 2004, and Saracco et al., 2006, and then contrasts them with another study that reported conflicting results.

The task is to assign the correct rhetorical class from the predefined list. First, I need to identify the general intent of the citation. The passage is comparing the results of two studies (Wei and Saracco) with another study. It's pointing out that while some studies found fast multiplication, others described conflicting results. This seems to be a comparison between different cited studies rather than comparing with the current paper.

Looking at the definitions, CoCoXY is used when the citation is comparing two cited studies with each other, not with the citing paper. In this case, the passage is comparing the findings of Wei et al. and Saracco et al. with another study, which fits the CoCoXY category because it's contrasting results between different cited works.

I don't think it's CoCoRes because that's when comparing with the citing paper's results. Here, it's comparing two other studies. It's not Support or Weakness because it's not supporting or criticizing the current work. It's a neutral comparison between existing studies. So the most appropriate class is CoCoXY.
