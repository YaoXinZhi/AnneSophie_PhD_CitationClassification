Okay, I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific article passage. Let's start by understanding the context.

The passage is about the use of magnetic water treatment devices in the USA since 1975, citing a source. The sentence is: "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@."

Step 1: Extract the context. The context is about the spread of magnetic water treatment devices in the USA since 1975, and the citation is used to support this statement.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation is providing information about the spread of these devices, which is a factual statement. It doesn't compare, motivate, or critique; it just describes a phenomenon.

Step 3: Select the specific rhetorical class. The example given for "Neutral" is exactly this situation: a citation used in a descriptive way without supporting, comparing, or criticizing. The citation is just stating a fact about the spread of devices.

So, the rhetorical class should be Neutral.
