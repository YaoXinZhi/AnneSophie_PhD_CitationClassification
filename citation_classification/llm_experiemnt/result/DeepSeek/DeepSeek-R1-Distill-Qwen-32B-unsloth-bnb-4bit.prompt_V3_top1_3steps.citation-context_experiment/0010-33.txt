Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me start by extracting the context and understanding the surrounding passage.

The passage says: "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@." 

First, I'll look at the context. The sentence is a factual statement about the spread of magnetic water treatment devices in the USA since 1975. The citation is providing a reference for this statement.

Now, identifying the general intent. The sentence is simply stating a fact without comparing, supporting, or criticizing anything. It's just providing information that the cited work has documented.

Looking at the predefined classes, the most appropriate one here is "Neutral" because the citation is used in a descriptive manner without any supporting, comparing, or critical intent. It's just stating a fact from the cited work without any additional argument or comparison.
