Okay, I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by understanding the context. The passage mentions that the citation is discussing the multiplication rates and conflicting results related to phytoplasma in plants. The example given is about how different studies have reported different findings, and the citation is pointing out this inconsistency.

Looking at the definitions, I need to determine the intent. The citation is comparing two studies (Wei et al., 2004 and Saracco et al., 2006) and noting conflicting results. This isn't comparing their work to the current paper, but rather comparing two cited studies with each other. That sounds like CoCoXY, which is used when comparing explanations or claims between two cited works.

So, the rhetorical class here is CoCoXY because it's comparing the conflicting results from two studies.
