Okay, I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage says: "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@@."

So, the context is about supporting a finding. The authors are saying that their finding is supported by other studies, specifically mentioning that in fleas and ticks, the host affects bacterial communities.

Next, I need to identify the general intent. The citation is used to back up their own finding, so it's supportive. That points towards either Support or Similar.

Looking at the definitions, Support is when the citation confirms the work or findings of the citing authors. Similar is when it points out a similarity between the cited work and the current paper. Here, the authors are explicitly saying their finding is supported by other research, which is a form of confirmation.

Therefore, the rhetorical class should be Support.

Support
