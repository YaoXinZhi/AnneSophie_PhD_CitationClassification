Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in the given passage. Let me start by reading the passage carefully. The passage says: "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@." 

First, I need to understand the context and the intent behind citing this reference. The sentence is making a factual statement about the spread of magnetic water treatment devices in the USA since 1975. The citation is providing a source for this information, but it's not being used to support a claim, compare with another study, or criticize previous work. It's just stating a fact and citing where this information comes from.

Looking at the predefined classes, I need to determine which one fits best. The classes include Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Motivation, Future, Support, Similar, Usage, Weakness, and Neutral. 

The sentence isn't introducing foundational work, so it's not Basis. It's not comparing methods, results, or explanations, so CoCoGM, CoCoRes, and CoCoXY don't apply. There's no motivation or suggestion for future research here, so Motivation and Future are out. The citation isn't supporting or similar to the current work, so Support and Similar don't fit. It's not about usage of a method, so Usage isn't it either. There's no criticism or weakness pointed out, so Weakness isn't applicable.

That leaves Neutral. The citation is used in a neutral, descriptive way to back up a factual statement without any comparative, supportive, or critical intent. So, the correct label here is Neutral.
