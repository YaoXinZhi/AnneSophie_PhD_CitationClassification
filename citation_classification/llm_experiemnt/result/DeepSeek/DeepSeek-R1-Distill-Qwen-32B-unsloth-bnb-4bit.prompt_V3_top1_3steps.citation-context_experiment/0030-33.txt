Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me go through the process step by step.

First, I need to extract the context discussing the citation. The passage is about the use of magnetic water treatment devices in the USA since 1975, citing a source. It's a straightforward statement of fact without any additional commentary or comparison.

Next, I need to identify the general intent of the citation. The sentence is simply providing information about when the use of these devices started in the USA. It's a neutral statement without any motivation, support, comparison, or criticism. It's just stating a fact.

Now, looking at the predefined classes, the most appropriate one here would be "Neutral" because the citation is used descriptively without supporting, comparing, criticizing, or motivating any specific argument. It's just providing background information.

So, the final label should be Neutral.

Neutral
