Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in the given passage. Let me start by understanding the task. The passage is about plant health, and the citation is tagged as @@CITATION@@. My job is to extract the context, identify the intent, and assign the most appropriate label from the predefined list.

First, I'll look at the passage. It says, "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@@." 

So, the main point here is that the authors are supporting their finding with another study. They mention that their finding is supported by recent investigations, and they're citing a specific study. The example given in the definitions for the 'Support' class is very similar: a citation used to confirm their results. 

Looking at the context, the authors are pointing out that their results align with previous research. They're not comparing their methods or goals, nor are they suggesting future work or pointing out weaknesses. It's a straightforward support for their findings.

I should also consider other possible classes. Could it be 'Similar'? Well, 'Similar' is when the cited work is noted for having similar results or patterns. Here, it's more about supporting the current finding rather than just noting similarity. 'Support' seems more accurate because the authors explicitly state that their finding is supported by the cited work.

Another possible class could be 'CoCoRes' if they were comparing results directly, but in this case, they're not contrasting or comparing; they're just supporting their result with another study. So 'Support' fits better.

I don't think it's 'Usage' because they're not using a method or tool from the cited work. It's also not 'Motivation' because they're not justifying why they're doing the research, but rather backing up their results.

So, after considering all the options, the most appropriate label here is 'Support'.
