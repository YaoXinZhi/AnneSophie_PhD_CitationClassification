Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific article passage. Let's start by extracting the context. The passage is about plant health, and the citation is within a discussion about the multiplication rates and conflicting results of a phytoplasma study. 

The sentence mentions that conflicting results were described in another study, citing @@CITATION@@. This suggests that the authors are pointing out a discrepancy between their findings and those of the cited work. 

Looking at the general intent, this seems like a comparative situation because they're comparing results from different studies. Specifically, they're contrasting their findings with the cited study's conflicting results. 

Now, looking at the predefined classes, CoCoRes is about comparing results, which fits here. The authors are highlighting that their results differ from the cited work, which is a direct comparison of findings.

So, the most appropriate label is CoCoRes.
