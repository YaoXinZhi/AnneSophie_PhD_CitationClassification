Alright, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by understanding the context and the process I need to follow.

First, the task is to assign a rhetorical class label from a predefined list. The list includes classes like Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, etc. The process involves three steps: extracting the context, identifying the general intent, and selecting the specific class.

Looking at the passage provided:

"In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@."

I need to extract the context discussing the citation. The sentence mentions the spread of magnetic water treatment devices in the USA since 1975 and cites a source. The context here is about the historical spread of these devices.

Next, I have to identify the general intent. The sentence is stating a fact about the spread of these devices without comparing, supporting, or criticizing anything. It's just providing information.

Now, mapping this to the general intents:

- Foundational → Basis
- Comparative → CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY
- Motivational → Motivation, Future
- Supportive → Support, Similar
- Technical → Usage
- Critical/Analytical → Weakness
- Descriptive → Neutral

Since the citation is used to provide a neutral fact without any supporting, comparing, or criticizing, it falls under the Descriptive category.

Looking at the predefined classes, the Neutral class is for citations used in a neutral, descriptive way. The example given for Neutral is exactly this kind of scenario: "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@."

Therefore, the rhetorical class for this citation is Neutral.
