Alright, I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let's start by understanding the context provided. The passage mentions that the citation refers to a study that found a high concentration of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains in young leaves and roots, but also notes conflicting results for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima. 

So, the context is comparing two studies. The first study by Wei et al., 2004, reports high concentrations, while the second by Saracco et al., 2006, found conflicting results. The citation is used to highlight these differing findings between the two studies. 

Looking at the definitions, CoCoXY is when the citation compares or contrasts two cited studies with each other, not with the current paper. Here, the passage is directly comparing the results of Wei et al. and Saracco et al., pointing out their conflicting outcomes. 

Other classes like CoCoRes involve comparing with the citing paper's results, but in this case, it's about comparing two other studies. So, CoCoXY fits best.
