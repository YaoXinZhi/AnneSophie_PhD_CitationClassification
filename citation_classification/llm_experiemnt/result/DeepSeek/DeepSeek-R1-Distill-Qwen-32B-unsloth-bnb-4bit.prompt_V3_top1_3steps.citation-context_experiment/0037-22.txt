Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific article passage. Let me start by understanding the context provided.

The passage says: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@."

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The sentence is pretty straightforward. It mentions that the experimental setup was described in detail before, and that's where the citation is placed. So the context here is about the method or setup used in the current study.

Next, I should identify the general intent of the citation. The sentence is referring to a previous work that detailed the experimental setup. This suggests that the current study is using that setup, so the citation is pointing to a method or tool used in their research.

Looking at the predefined rhetorical classes, the Usage category seems to fit here. Usage is when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup that's directly used in the current study. In this case, the experimental setup is being cited as something they used, so it's about usage.

I don't think it's any other category like Support or Weakness because the citation isn't being used to support a claim or criticize the previous work. It's simply stating where the setup was described before, indicating that they're using it.

So, putting it all together, the rhetorical class for this citation is Usage.
