Okay, I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me go through the process step by step.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the cited work reports on the multiplication rates and high concentration of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains in specific plant parts. It also notes conflicting results for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima, referencing @@CITATION@@. 

Next, I need to identify the general intent. The passage is comparing two studies: one by Wei et al. and Saracco et al., and another cited work. It's pointing out that while the first studies found certain results, the cited work shows conflicting findings. This suggests a comparison between the cited works themselves, not directly with the current paper.

Looking at the rhetorical classes, the specific example given for CoCoXY involves comparing two cited studies. Since the passage is contrasting results between different studies, it fits the CoCoXY category. The citation is used to highlight the conflicting results, which is a comparison of explanations or claims between the cited works.

I don't think it's any other category because it's not comparing methods or results with the current paper, nor is it supporting, motivating, or pointing out weaknesses. It's purely about comparing two cited studies.
