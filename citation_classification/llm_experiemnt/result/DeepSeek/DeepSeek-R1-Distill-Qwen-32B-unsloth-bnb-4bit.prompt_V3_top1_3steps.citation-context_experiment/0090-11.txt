Alright, I need to determine the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the context provided is: "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@." 

Step 1: Extract the context discussing the citation. The sentence mentions that the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading in the USA since 1975, citing a reference. The purpose here is to provide a factual statement about the spread of these devices.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation is used to back up the statement about the spread of magnetic water treatment devices. It's providing a source for the information, but it's not comparing, supporting, or motivating anything beyond stating a fact.

Step 3: Select the specific rhetorical class. The citation here is used neutrally to provide a reference for the information given. It doesn't support the authors' work, compare methods, or point out weaknesses. It's simply stating a fact with a citation, which fits the "Neutral" category.
