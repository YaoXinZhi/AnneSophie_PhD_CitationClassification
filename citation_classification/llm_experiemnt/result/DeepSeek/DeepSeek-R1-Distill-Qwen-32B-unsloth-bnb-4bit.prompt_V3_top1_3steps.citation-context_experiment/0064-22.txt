Alright, I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. Let me go through the process step by step.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the citation discusses the taxonomic status of 18 species collected on pear. It states that the status is problematic, suggesting some may not develop on Pyrus.

Next, I'll identify the general intent. The mention of the taxonomic status being problematic and questioning if some species may not develop on Pyrus indicates criticism or pointing out limitations in the cited work.

Looking at the rhetorical classes, the one that fits is "Weakness," as the citation is used to highlight flaws or issues in the previous study.
