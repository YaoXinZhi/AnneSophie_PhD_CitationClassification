Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me go through the steps one by one.

First, I need to extract the context discussing the citation. The passage says, "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@." So the context is about the spread of magnetic water treatment devices in the USA starting from 1975, and the citation is just providing a reference for that statement.

Next, I need to identify the general intent of the citation. The sentence is simply stating a fact about the spread of these devices without any additional argument or comparison. It's just providing information without supporting, comparing, or criticizing anything. So the intent here is descriptive.

Now, looking at the predefined rhetorical classes, the one that fits a descriptive, neutral use is "Neutral." The example given for Neutral is exactly this kind of situation where the citation is used to back up a factual statement without any further analysis or comparison.

So putting it all together, the citation here is serving a neutral purpose by providing a reference for a stated fact without any supporting, comparing, or critical intent.
