Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by understanding the context and then determine the intent.

The passage is about a study on the hard calcite scale formed by hard water and the use of magnetic fields to prevent it. The authors mention that their previous research showed the effectiveness of magnetic treatment but didn't explain the mechanism. They aim to understand this mechanism in their current work.

Looking at the sentence: "Our previous research @@CITATION@@ has shown that the formation of the hard calcite scale on the surfaces exposed to hard water can be successfully prevented with the applied magnetic field. The explanation of the phenomena is not yet offered and the purpose of this work is to try to understand the mechanism of the beneficial influence of the magnetic treatment."

The citation here refers to their own previous work. The context is explaining why they're conducting this new research. They're pointing out that while their past study showed effectiveness, the mechanism isn't understood, hence the motivation for the current study.

So, the general intent is motivational. It's justifying why the current research is being done by identifying a knowledge gapâ€”specifically, the lack of an explanation for the phenomenon observed in their previous work.

Now, looking at the rhetorical classes, Motivation is the category where the citation is used to justify the current research by identifying a knowledge gap or open question. The example provided for Motivation matches this scenario, where a previous study's findings prompt further investigation.

I don't think it's Support because they're not confirming their current findings with the citation. It's not Comparative or Usage because they're not comparing methods or using a tool from the cited work. It's clearly about motivating the current research by pointing out an unanswered question from their earlier work.

So, the most appropriate label is Motivation.
