Okay, I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in the given passage. Let me start by understanding the context. The passage mentions that the citation discusses the taxonomic status of certain species as problematic. The main point is that some species might not develop on Pyrus. 

Looking at the definitions, the citation is pointing out a limitation or issue in the cited work. It's not supporting or comparing; instead, it's highlighting a weakness. So the appropriate class should be Weakness.

The citation highlights a problematic taxonomic status, pointing out a limitation in the cited work.

Weakness
