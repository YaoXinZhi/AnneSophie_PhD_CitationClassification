Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage says: "Our previous research @@CITATION@@ has shown that the formation of the hard calcite scale on the surfaces exposed to hard water can be successfully prevented with the applied magnetic field. The explanation of the phenomena is not yet offered and the purpose of this work is to try to understand the mechanism of the beneficial influence of the magnetic treatment."

So, the context is about the authors referencing their own previous research. They mention that their earlier work showed that magnetic fields can prevent calcite scale formation. However, they point out that the explanation for this phenomenon hasn't been provided yet, which is why they're conducting this current study.

Next, I need to identify the general intent of this citation. The authors are using their previous work to justify why they're doing this new research. They're pointing out a gap in their earlier findingsâ€”specifically, that while they know the magnetic treatment works, they don't understand why. This is a motivation for their current study.

Looking at the predefined rhetorical classes, "Motivation" fits here because the citation is used to identify a knowledge gap and justify the current research. The authors are setting up the need for their study by referencing their own prior work and highlighting what hasn't been done yet.

I don't think it's "Basis" because they're not establishing a foundational theory or method from their previous work. It's more about why they're doing the current work, which is motivation. It's not a comparison (CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY), nor are they supporting or criticizing their previous work. It's clearly about motivating their current research by pointing out an unaddressed aspect of their prior findings.
