Alright, let's try to figure out the rhetorical class for this citation. The user provided a passage that includes the citation @@CITATION@@. I need to extract the context, understand the intent, and assign the correct label.

First, I'll look at the passage. It says, "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@." The context here is about the spread of magnetic water treatment devices in the USA since 1975. The citation is providing a factual statement without any additional commentary or comparison.

Next, I need to identify the general intent. The citation is simply stating a fact about the spread of these devices. There's no comparison, support, motivation, or criticism involved. It's just a descriptive statement.

Looking at the predefined classes, "Neutral" fits here because the citation is used in a neutral, descriptive way without supporting, comparing, or criticizing anything. It's just providing background information.

So, the rhetorical class for this citation is Neutral.
