Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in this passage. Let me start by understanding the context. The passage mentions that the citation discusses the multiplication rates of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains in young leaves and roots, but also notes conflicting results for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima. 

Hmm, the key here is that the citation is being used to compare two studies. One reports high multiplication rates, while the other describes conflicting results. This isn't a comparison between the citing paper and another work, but rather between two different cited works. 

Looking at the definitions, CoCoXY is when the citation compares or contrasts two cited studies with each other. That fits because the passage is pointing out the difference in results between Wei et al. and another study. It's not about the current paper's methods or results, just comparing what others have found.

So, the rhetorical class should be CoCoXY.
