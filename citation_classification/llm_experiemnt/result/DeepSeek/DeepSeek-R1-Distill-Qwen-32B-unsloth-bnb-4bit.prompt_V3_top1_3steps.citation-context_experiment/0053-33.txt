Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by carefully reading the context around the citation. 

The passage says: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." Hmm, the key part here is "experimental set-up was described in detail previously." That makes me think the authors are referring to a method or setup that was used in a previous study. 

Looking at the predefined classes, I see "Usage" which refers to citing a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup used in the current study. Since the passage is mentioning that the setup was described before and is now being used again, this fits the Usage category. 

I don't think it's any of the other classes because they don't mention comparing results, motivating the study, or supporting findings. It's purely about using a previously described setup, so Usage is the best fit.
