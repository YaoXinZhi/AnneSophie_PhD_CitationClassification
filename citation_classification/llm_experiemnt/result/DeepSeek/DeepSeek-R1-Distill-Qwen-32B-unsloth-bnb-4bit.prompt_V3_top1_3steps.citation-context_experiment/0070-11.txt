Okay, I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let's start by reading the passage carefully. 

The passage says, "The taxonomic status of these species is problematic and some may not develop on Pyrus @@CITATION@@." So, the authors are pointing out that the cited work's taxonomic status is problematic. They mention that some species might not develop on Pyrus, which suggests they're questioning the accuracy or completeness of the cited study. 

Looking at the definitions, the Weakness class is when the citation is used to criticize or point out limitations in the cited work. This fits because the authors are highlighting that the taxonomic status is problematic, indicating a flaw in the cited study. 

Other classes like Support or Similar don't apply here because the authors aren't confirming or showing similarity. It's not a comparison of methods or results (CoCoGM, CoCoRes), nor is it foundational or motivational. They're directly pointing out a weakness in the cited work.
