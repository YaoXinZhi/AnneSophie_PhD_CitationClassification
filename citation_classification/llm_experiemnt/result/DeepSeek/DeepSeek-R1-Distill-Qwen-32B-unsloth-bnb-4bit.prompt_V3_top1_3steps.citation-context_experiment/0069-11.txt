Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me start by understanding the process.

First, I'll extract the context. The passage is about plant health, specifically discussing the multiplication rates of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains in daisy plants. It mentions conflicting results from previous studies: one study reports fast multiplication rates and high concentration in young leaves and roots, while another describes conflicting results for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima.

The citation @@CITATION@@ is used in the context of these conflicting results. The sentence says, "although conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima @@CITATION@@."

Now, looking at the intent. The general intent seems to be comparing two studies. The first part of the sentence refers to one study showing fast multiplication, and the second part, with the citation, refers to another study showing conflicting results. This is a comparison between two cited works, not comparing to the current paper's results.

So, the specific rhetorical class would be CoCoXY because it's comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies. The context is pointing out that one study found high multiplication rates, while another found conflicting results, thus comparing the two findings.
