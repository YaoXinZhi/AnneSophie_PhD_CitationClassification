Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific article passage. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage says, "The taxonomic status of these species is problematic and some may not develop on Pyrus @@CITATION@@." This indicates that the authors are pointing out issues or limitations in the cited work regarding the taxonomic status of certain species.

Next, I'll identify the general intent. The authors are criticizing or questioning the cited work's findings, pointing out that the taxonomic status is problematic. This suggests a critical or analytical intent.

Now, looking at the predefined classes, the one that fits this is "Weakness," which is used when a citation is cited to criticize, question, or point out limitations in the cited work.

So, the rhetorical class for this citation is "Weakness."

The citation is pointing out a limitation in the cited work, indicating a critical intent.

**Weakness**
