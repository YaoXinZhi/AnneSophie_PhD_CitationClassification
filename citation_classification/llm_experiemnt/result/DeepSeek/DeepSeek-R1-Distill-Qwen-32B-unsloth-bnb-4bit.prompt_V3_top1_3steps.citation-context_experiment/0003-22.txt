Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the citation is used to support the finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly. It references a study where in fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages, while rodent hosts and environmental conditions didn't play a role. So the context is about supporting the current paper's findings with another study.

Next, I identify the general intent. The citation is used to back up the current research's conclusion, which means it's supportive.

Now, looking at the specific rhetorical classes, Support is when the citation confirms or supports the current work's results. Since the example directly uses the cited study to back up their findings about hosts affecting bacterial communities, it fits the Support category.

I don't think it's Comparative because it's not comparing methods or results between studies, just using another study as evidence. It's not Motivational or Future since it's not justifying why the research is being done or suggesting future directions. It's clearly supporting their own results, so Support is the right label.
