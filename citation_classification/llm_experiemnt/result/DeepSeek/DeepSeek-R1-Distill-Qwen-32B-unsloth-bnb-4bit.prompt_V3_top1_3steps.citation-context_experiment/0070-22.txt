Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in this context. The user provided a passage, but I don't see it here. Wait, maybe I missed it. Let me check again. Hmm, no, the passage isn't provided. Oh, wait, the user included a context where the passage is delimited by backticks, but I don't see any backticks here. Maybe the passage is missing or perhaps it's in the initial query.

Wait, looking back, the user provided an example with the passage inside backticks. Let me see: 

"In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@."

So the passage is about the spread of magnetic water treatment devices in the USA since 1975, citing a source. The task is to classify this citation into one of the predefined rhetorical classes.

Step 1: Extract the context. The context here is that magnetic water treatment devices have been spreading in the USA since 1975, and the citation is used to support this statement.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation is providing information about the spread of these devices, which is a factual statement. It's not comparing methods or results, nor is it motivating or suggesting future research. It's just stating a fact.

Step 3: Assign the specific rhetorical class. Since the citation is used to provide a neutral fact without supporting, comparing, or criticizing, it's classified as Neutral.
