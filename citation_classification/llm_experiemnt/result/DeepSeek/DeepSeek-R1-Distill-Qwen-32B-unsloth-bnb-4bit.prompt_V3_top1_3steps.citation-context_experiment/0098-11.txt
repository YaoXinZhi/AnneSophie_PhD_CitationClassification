Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let's start by reading the context provided.

The passage says: "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@." 

Step 1: Extract the context. The context here is about the spread of magnetic water treatment devices in the USA since 1975. The citation is just providing a reference for this statement.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation is used to back up the statement about the spread of these devices. It's providing a source for the information given, without comparing, supporting, or motivating anything else.

Step 3: Assign the rhetorical class. Since the citation is used neutrally to reference a fact without any comparative, supportive, or critical intent, the appropriate label is Neutral.
