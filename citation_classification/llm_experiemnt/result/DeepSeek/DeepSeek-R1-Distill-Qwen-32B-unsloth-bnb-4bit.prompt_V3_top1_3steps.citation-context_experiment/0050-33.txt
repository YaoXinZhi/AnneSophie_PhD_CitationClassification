Okay, so I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. Let me start by understanding the context and the task step by step.

First, the passage is about a study on plant health, specifically looking at how magnetic fields affect the formation of calcite scales in hard water. The authors mention that their previous research showed that magnetic fields can prevent scale formation but didn't explain why. They aim to understand the mechanism behind this effect.

Looking at the citation @@CITATION@@, it's mentioned right after their previous research, which is their own work. The context is that their previous study found a phenomenon but didn't explain it, and now they're trying to understand the mechanism. The citation is used to justify why they're conducting this new researchâ€”because there's a gap in understanding the mechanism.

Now, considering the rhetorical classes, the general intent here is motivational because they're explaining why this research is necessary. The specific class would be Motivation since they're identifying a knowledge gap from their previous work to justify their current study.

I don't think it's any other class like Support or Basis because they're not confirming their results or establishing a foundation but rather pointing out a gap to motivate their research.

The citation is used to justify the current research by identifying a knowledge gap from the authors' previous work. This aligns with the Motivation class as it explains why the study is being conducted.

**Motivation**
