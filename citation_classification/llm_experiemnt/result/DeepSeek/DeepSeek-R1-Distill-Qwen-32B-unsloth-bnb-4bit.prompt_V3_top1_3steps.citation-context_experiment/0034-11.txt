Alright, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the context provided. The passage is about the use of magnetic water treatment devices in the USA since 1975, citing a source. The task is to determine the rhetorical class of this citation.

Step 1: Extract the context. The sentence is: "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@." The context here is simply stating a fact about the spread of these devices, without any additional analysis or comparison.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation is providing a factual statement without any indication of supporting, comparing, motivating, or criticizing. It's just stating that the spread has been happening since 1975, referencing a source for this information.

Step 3: Select the specific rhetorical class. Looking at the definitions, Neutral is used when the citation is descriptive without supporting, comparing, etc. Since the passage is just stating a fact without any further argument or comparison, Neutral fits here.

I don't see any elements of comparison, support, motivation, or criticism. It's purely descriptive. So the rhetorical class should be Neutral.
