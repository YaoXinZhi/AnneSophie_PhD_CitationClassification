Alright, I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. The passage mentions that the authors are introducing and validating a method, and they're replicating inoffensive results for the same purposes. The citation is about foundational work that provided the basis for their current research. This sounds like it's establishing the intellectual foundation, so the class should be Basis.

The citation is foundational, providing the basis for the current research. 

Basis
