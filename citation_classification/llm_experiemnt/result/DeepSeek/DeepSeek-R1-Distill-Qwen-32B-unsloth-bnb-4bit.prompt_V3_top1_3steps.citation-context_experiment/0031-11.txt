Okay, I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I'll look at the context provided. The passage says that a study found some species collected on pear trees, but it mentions that the taxonomic status is problematic. So, the authors are pointing out that there's an issue with the classification of these species.

Now, I need to determine the general intent. The authors are highlighting a limitation or problem in the cited work. This seems critical because they're pointing out that some species might not develop on Pyrus, which suggests a potential flaw in the previous study.

Looking at the predefined classes, the one that fits this is "Weakness." This is because the citation is used to critique the cited work, pointing out its limitations or flaws.

So, the rhetorical class here is "Weakness."

The citation points out a problematic taxonomic status, indicating a limitation in the cited work.

**Weakness**
