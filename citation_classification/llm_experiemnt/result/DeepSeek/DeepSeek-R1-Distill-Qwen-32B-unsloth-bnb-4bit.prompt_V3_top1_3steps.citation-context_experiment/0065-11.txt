Alright, I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. Let me start by understanding the context and the task.

The passage is about plant health, specifically discussing the multiplication rates and conflicting results of different phytoplasma strains in various plants. The citation is mentioned in the context of conflicting results between two studies: one by Wei et al. and another by Saracco et al. The sentence is: "Fast multiplication rates and high concentration of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains have been reported in young developing leaves and roots of infected daisy plants (Wei et al., 2004; Saracco et al., 2006), although conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima @@CITATION@@."

Step 1: Extract the context. The context is comparing two studies (Wei et al. and Saracco et al.) that have conflicting results regarding phytoplasma multiplication rates in different plants. The citation is used to highlight this conflict.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation is comparing two studies to show conflicting results, which falls under a comparative intent. Specifically, it's comparing explanations or claims between the two cited works.

Step 3: Select the specific rhetorical class. Since the citation is comparing two studies with each other rather than with the current paper, it's an example of CoCoXY (Comparison of Explanations or Claims).

I think the correct label is CoCoXY because it's directly comparing the results of two different studies to show conflicting findings.
