Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific article passage. Let me start by understanding the context and the process I need to follow.

First, the context provided is: "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@."

Step 1 is to extract the context discussing the citation. The sentence mentions that the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975, and this is supported by the citation. The key point here is that the citation is providing information about the spread of these devices in the USA.

Step 2 is to identify the general intent of the citation. Looking at the sentence, the citation is used to provide a factual statement about the spread of magnetic water treatment devices. It's not comparing anything, supporting a finding, or motivating further research. It's simply stating a fact.

Now, moving to Step 3, I need to select the specific rhetorical class. The options are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Motivation, Future, Support, Similar, Usage, Weakness, Neutral.

In this case, the citation is used neutrally to provide background information without supporting, comparing, or critiquing the work. It's a straightforward mention of a fact, so the rhetorical class should be Neutral.

I should make sure I'm not confusing it with Support. Support is when the citation confirms a finding or result, but here it's just stating a fact without necessarily supporting a specific claim of the current paper. It's more about describing a situation.

So, the most appropriate label is Neutral.
