Okay, I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let's start by understanding the context.

The passage says, "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@." So, the citation is about the spread of magnetic water treatment devices in the USA starting from 1975.

Now, looking at the definitions, I need to see which class fits this. The citation is providing a factual statement without supporting, comparing, or criticizing anything. It's just stating that the use has been spreading since that year, which is a neutral piece of information.

So, the general intent is descriptive, which corresponds to the Neutral class. The citation isn't used to support or argue a point but simply to state a fact.

Therefore, the rhetorical class is Neutral.
