Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by understanding the task and the definitions provided.

First, the task is to classify the citation into one of the predefined rhetorical classes: Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Motivation, Future, Support, Similar, Usage, Weakness, Neutral. 

The passage provided is about the study of phytoplasmas in daisy plants. It mentions that conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima, citing @@CITATION@@. 

Looking at the definitions, I need to determine the general intent of the citation. The passage is comparing results from two studies: one where fast multiplication rates and high concentration were reported, and another where conflicting results were found. This suggests that the citation is being used to compare two studies with each other, not with the current paper.

The specific class for this would be CoCoXY, which is used when the citation compares or contrasts two cited studies. The example given for CoCoXY also involves conflicting results between two studies, which aligns perfectly with the passage here.

So, the citation is being used to point out conflicting results between two studies, hence it falls under CoCoXY.
