Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me start by understanding the context provided.

The passage says: "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@." 

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. It's a simple statement about the spread of magnetic water treatment devices in the USA since 1975, and the citation is attached to this statement.

Next, I need to identify the general intent of the citation. The sentence is providing a factual statement without any comparison, support, motivation, or criticism. It's just stating a fact about the spread of these devices, and the citation is probably backing up this information.

Looking at the predefined classes, the options are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Motivation, Future, Support, Similar, Usage, Weakness, Neutral. 

The example given for Neutral is exactly this kind of situation: a citation used in a neutral, descriptive way without supporting, comparing, criticizing, or motivating. The passage is simply stating a fact, so the citation is likely just providing a reference without any of the other intents.

Therefore, the rhetorical class here should be Neutral.
