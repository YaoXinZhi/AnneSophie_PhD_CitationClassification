Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific article passage. Let me go through the steps carefully.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage is about the multiplication rates of 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains in daisy plants. It mentions that Wei et al. (2004) and Saracco et al. (2006) reported high rates in young leaves and roots. However, conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima, citing @@CITATION@@.

Now, I need to identify the general intent. The context is comparing two studies: one that found high rates and another that found conflicting results. The citation is pointing out the discrepancy between these two studies.

Looking at the rhetorical classes, CoCoXY is about comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies, not with the current paper. That fits because the passage is contrasting the findings of Wei et al. and the cited work. 

So, the rhetorical class should be CoCoXY.
