Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let's start by understanding the task. The goal is to assign a label from a predefined list based on how the citation is used in the passage.

First, I'll extract the context. The passage is: "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@." So, the citation is about the spread of magnetic water treatment devices in the USA since 1975.

Next, I need to identify the general intent. The sentence is providing a factual statement without any comparison, motivation, support, or criticism. It's simply stating a fact that the use has been spreading since a specific year.

Looking at the rhetorical classes, "Neutral" is used when the citation is descriptive without supporting, comparing, criticizing, or motivating an argument. This fits because the citation is just providing background information without any further analysis or comparison.

So, the appropriate label here is Neutral.
