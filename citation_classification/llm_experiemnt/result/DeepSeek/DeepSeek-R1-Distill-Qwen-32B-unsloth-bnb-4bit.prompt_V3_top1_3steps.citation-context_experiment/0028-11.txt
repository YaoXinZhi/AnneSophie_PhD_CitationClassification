Okay, I need to determine the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the citation reports on the multiplication rates and high concentration of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains in young developing leaves and roots of infected daisy plants. However, it also notes conflicting results described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima. So, the citation is being used to point out conflicting results between two studies.

Next, I'll identify the general intent. The citation is comparing two studies, highlighting that one reports certain findings while another describes conflicting results. This suggests a comparative intent, specifically comparing the explanations or claims of two cited works.

Now, looking at the predefined classes, CoCoXY is used when the citation compares or contrasts two cited studies with each other, not with the citing paper. This fits because the context is discussing conflicting results between two different studies, both cited.

So, the rhetorical class should be CoCoXY.
