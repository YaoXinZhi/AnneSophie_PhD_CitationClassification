Alright, I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. Let's go through the steps carefully.

First, I'll extract the context discussing the citation. The passage says: "In the study of plant health, the influence of soil pH on root development has been extensively explored @@CITATION@@. Our research builds upon these findings to investigate the additional impact of soil moisture."

Next, I'll identify the general intent of the citation. The context mentions that the cited work has "extensively explored" the influence of soil pH on root development, and the current research is building upon these findings. This suggests that the citation is providing foundational information that the current study is expanding upon.

Now, considering the predefined classes, the most appropriate one here is "Basis." This is because the cited work is serving as the intellectual foundation for the current research, establishing the groundwork that the authors are building upon.

I don't think it's any other class because it's not comparing methods or results (so not CoCoGM or CoCoRes), nor is it supporting or critiquing the cited work. It's simply using the cited work as a basis for their own study.
