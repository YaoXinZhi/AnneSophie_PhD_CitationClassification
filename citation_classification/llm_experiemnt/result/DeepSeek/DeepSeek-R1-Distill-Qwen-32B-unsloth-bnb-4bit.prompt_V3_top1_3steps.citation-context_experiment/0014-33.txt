Okay, I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by carefully reading the passage provided.

The passage mentions that the citation is referring to a study where 18 species were described from China, collected on cultivated and wild pear. It then states that the taxonomic status of these species is problematic and some may not develop on Pyrus.

So, the context here is discussing a previous study that identified 18 species. The citing paper is pointing out that the taxonomic status of these species is unclear or problematic. This suggests that the cited work might have some issues or limitations in its classification or identification of these species.

Looking at the definitions, the rhetorical classes are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Motivation, Future, Support, Similar, Usage, Weakness, and Neutral.

The key point here is that the citing paper is pointing out a problem with the cited work's findings. Specifically, it's saying that the taxonomic status is problematic, which implies a criticism or pointing out a limitation in the cited study.

Therefore, the general intent here is critical or analytical. The cited work is being used to highlight a weakness in its methodology or conclusions. So, the appropriate rhetorical class would be Weakness.

Weakness
