Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage says: "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@@."

So, the context is about supporting the current study's findings. The authors mention that their finding is supported by recent studies on insect-associated bacteria. They specifically note that in fleas and ticks, the host affects bacterial communities, similar to their own results.

Next, I need to identify the general intent. The citation is used to back up their own findings, so it's supportive. That points towards the Support or Similar class.

Looking at the definitions, Support is when the citation confirms the current work's results. Similar is when it points out a similarity between the cited work and the current paper. Here, the authors are saying that their finding is supported by other studies, which indicates that the cited work's results align with theirs. So, it's more about supporting their findings rather than just pointing out a similarity.

Wait, but the example given for Similar is about supporting findings as well. Hmm. Let me recheck the definitions.

The Support example is about previous research confirming the current results. The Similar example is about another study showing a similar pattern. In the passage, the authors say their finding is supported by recent investigations, so it's more about confirmation, hence Support.

Alternatively, the passage also mentions that in fleas and ticks, the host governs bacterial assemblages, similar to their results. So, it's pointing out a similarity in results, which might lean towards Similar. But the key word is "supported by," which indicates that the cited work is backing up their own findings.

So, the intent is to support their results by citing similar findings from other studies. Therefore, the rhetorical class is Support.
