Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me start by understanding the context. The passage says that the citation is pointing out conflicting results between two studies regarding the multiplication rates and concentration of 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains in daisy plants. 

Step 1: Extract the context. The context mentions that two studies have conflicting results. One study by Wei et al. (2004) and Saracco et al. (2006) reports high rates, while another study (the cited one) describes conflicting results for a different phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation is comparing two studies to highlight the conflicting results. It's not comparing with the current paper's results but rather two other studies.

Step 3: Assign the specific rhetorical class. Since it's comparing two cited studies with each other, the class is CoCoXY.
