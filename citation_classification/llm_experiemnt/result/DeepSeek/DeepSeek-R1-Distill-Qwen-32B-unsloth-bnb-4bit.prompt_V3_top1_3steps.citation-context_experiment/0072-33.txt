Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by reading the passage carefully.

The passage is about plant health, specifically the impact of host plants on the composition of bacterial communities in insects. It mentions that in fleas and ticks, the arthropod host determines the bacterial assemblages, while rodent hosts and environmental conditions don't play a role. The citation is used to support this statement.

Now, looking at the definitions, the Support class is when the citation is used to confirm or back up the work of the current authors. In this case, the citation is pointing to similar findings in other studies, which aligns with the Support category. The authors are using it to strengthen their own findings by showing that their results are consistent with previous research.

I don't think it's any other class like CoCoRes or Similar because it's not comparing their results directly with the cited work or another study. It's more about confirming their findings by referencing another study that found the same thing. So, the most appropriate label here is Support.
