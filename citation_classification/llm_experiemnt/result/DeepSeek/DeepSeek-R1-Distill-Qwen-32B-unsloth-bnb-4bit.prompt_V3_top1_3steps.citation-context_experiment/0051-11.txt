Alright, I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me go through the steps as outlined.

First, I'll extract the context discussing the citation. The passage is about plant health, specifically mentioning a study on phytoplasma in daisy plants. The citation is used in a sentence that contrasts results from other studies. The sentence says, "Fast multiplication rates and high concentration of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains have been reported in young developing leaves and roots of infected daisy plants (Wei et al., 2004; Saracco et al., 2006), although conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima @@CITATION@@."

So, the context is about conflicting results between different studies on phytoplasma in plants. The citation is used to contrast the findings of one study with another.

Next, I need to identify the general intent. Since the citation is comparing the results of two studies, it's a comparative intent. Now, looking at the specific rhetorical classes, the options under comparative are CoCoGM, CoCoRes, and CoCoXY.

CoCoRes is for comparing results directly with the citing paper, but in this case, the citation is comparing two cited works with each other, not with the current paper. That fits CoCoXY, which is used when comparing two cited studies.

So, the rhetorical class should be CoCoXY.
