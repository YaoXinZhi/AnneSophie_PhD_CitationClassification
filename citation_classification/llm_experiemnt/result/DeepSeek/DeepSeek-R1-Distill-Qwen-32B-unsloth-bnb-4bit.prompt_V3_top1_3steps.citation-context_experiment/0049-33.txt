Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in the given passage. Let me start by understanding the task. The user provided a context where they are a classifier assigning a rhetorical class to a citation in a scientific article. The predefined classes are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Motivation, Future, Support, Similar, Usage, Weakness, Neutral.

The passage given is: "The taxonomic status of these species is problematic and some may not develop on Pyrus @@CITATION@@." 

First, I should extract the context discussing the citation. The sentence mentions that the taxonomic status is problematic, which implies a critical view. The citation is pointing out an issue with the cited work.

Next, I need to identify the general intent. The sentence is pointing out a limitation or problem in the cited work, so it's Critical/Analytical.

Looking at the specific classes, the one that fits is Weakness because the citation is used to criticize or point out limitations in the cited work. The example given for Weakness is similar, where the taxonomic status is problematic.

So, the rhetorical class here is Weakness.
</think>

The citation is used to criticize the taxonomic status of species, pointing out a limitation. 

**Weakness**
