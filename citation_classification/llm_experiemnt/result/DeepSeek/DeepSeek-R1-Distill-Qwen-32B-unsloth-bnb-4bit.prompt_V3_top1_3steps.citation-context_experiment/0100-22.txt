Okay, I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific article passage. Let me go through the steps one by one.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage says: "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@." So, the citation is referring to the spread of magnetic water treatment devices in the USA since 1975.

Next, I need to identify the general intent of the citation. The sentence is simply stating a fact about the spread of these devices without any additional commentary or comparison. It's providing background information without supporting, comparing, or criticizing anything.

Now, looking at the predefined rhetorical classes, the one that fits here is "Neutral." The citation is used descriptively to provide context without any further argument or analysis.

I don't think it's any other class like Support or Usage because there's no mention of the effectiveness or method used. It's just a neutral statement of when and where the devices started being used.
