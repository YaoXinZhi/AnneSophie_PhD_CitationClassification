Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me go through the process step by step.

First, I'll extract the context discussing the citation. The passage is: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." So the context is about the experimental setup being detailed in a prior study.

Next, I need to identify the general intent of the citation. The sentence mentions that the setup was described in detail elsewhere, which suggests that the current study is using that setup. This points towards the citation being about a method or tool used in the current research.

Looking at the predefined classes, "Usage" is the one where the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup used in the current study. The example given for Usage is exactly this scenario, where the setup is referenced from another study.

I don't think it's any other class because it's not comparing, supporting, or motivating. It's purely stating that the setup was used as described elsewhere. So the most appropriate label is Usage.
