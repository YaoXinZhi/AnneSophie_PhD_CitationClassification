Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage says, "The taxonomic status of these species is problematic and some may not develop on Pyrus @@CITATION@@." So the citation is referring to a study that describes the taxonomic status of some species, pointing out that it's problematic and questioning whether some develop on Pyrus.

Next, I need to identify the general intent. The citation is pointing out that the taxonomic status is problematic and that some species may not develop on Pyrus. This seems like a critical statement about the cited work, suggesting that the findings or conclusions might be flawed or uncertain.

Now, looking at the rhetorical classes, "Weakness" is when the citation is used to criticize or point out limitations in the cited work. This fits because the passage is highlighting that the taxonomic status is problematic, which implies a weakness in the cited study's findings or methodology.

So, the rhetorical class here is "Weakness."
