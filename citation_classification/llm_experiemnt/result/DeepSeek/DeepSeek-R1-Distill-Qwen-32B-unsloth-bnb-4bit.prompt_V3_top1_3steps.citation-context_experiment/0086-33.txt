Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me start by extracting the context around the citation.

The passage is about plant health, specifically discussing the multiplication rates and concentration of two strains of 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' in infected daisy plants. It mentions that conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima, citing @@CITATION@@.

Now, looking at the context, the citation is comparing two studies. The first part talks about reports from Wei et al., 2004 and Saracco et al., 2006, which found high rates in daisy plants. The second part, however, mentions conflicting results for a different phytoplasma in Euphorbia, citing @@CITATION@@. So the citation is being used to contrast two findings: one where there are high rates and another where the results are conflicting.

The general intent here seems to be comparative. The authors are pointing out that while some studies show high multiplication rates, others, like the cited one, show conflicting results. This isn't about motivating their research or supporting their findings; it's about comparing two different outcomes from different studies.

Looking at the predefined classes, CoCoXY is for comparing two cited studies with each other, not with the citing paper. In this case, the citation is used to show a contrast between two studies (Wei et al. and Saracco et al. vs. the cited one). So the specific rhetorical class should be CoCoXY.

I don't think it's CoCoRes because it's not directly comparing their results with another study's results. It's more about comparing two cited studies in terms of their findings. Also, it's not about methods or goals, so CoCoGM isn't applicable. It's definitely a comparison between explanations or claims from two different studies, hence CoCoXY.
