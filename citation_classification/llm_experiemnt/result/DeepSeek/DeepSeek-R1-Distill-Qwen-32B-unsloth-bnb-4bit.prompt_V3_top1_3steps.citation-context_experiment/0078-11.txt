Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by understanding the context.

The passage mentions that the experimental setup was described in detail previously. The citation is referring to a previous work where the setup was detailed. So, the authors are pointing out that they used a method or setup that was previously described.

Looking at the definitions, the 'Usage' category refers to citations that mention a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup used in the current study. In this case, the citation is directly referencing a previous description of their experimental setup, which they are now using again. 

I don't think it's 'Basis' because it's not the foundation of their research. It's more about the method they used. It's not a comparison, so 'CoCoGM', 'CoCoRes', or 'CoCoXY' don't fit. It's not motivational or future-oriented either. They're not supporting their findings with another study, so 'Support' isn't right. There's no similarity being pointed out, so 'Similar' doesn't apply. They're not using it to show a weakness or in a neutral way. 

So, the most appropriate label here is 'Usage' because they're referencing a previous work for their method or setup.

The citation refers to a previous detailed description of the experimental setup, indicating that the current study uses this setup. This fits the 'Usage' category as it directly references a method used in the current research.
