Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by understanding the context and the steps I need to follow.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage says, "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@." The sentence is straightforwardâ€”it's just stating a fact about the spread of magnetic water treatment devices in the USA since 1975, citing a source for that information.

Next, I have to identify the general intent of the citation. Looking at the sentence, it's providing background information without any comparative, supportive, or critical tone. It's simply describing a trend, so the intent is descriptive.

Now, mapping this to the predefined rhetorical classes. The options are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Motivation, Future, Support, Similar, Usage, Weakness, Neutral. Since the citation is used neutrally to provide a factual statement without supporting, comparing, or criticizing, the appropriate class is Neutral.

I don't see any elements of comparison, support, motivation, or usage here. It's just a neutral mention of a fact with a citation.
