Okay, I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me start by understanding the context provided.

The context is about the citation being used in a passage that discusses the use of magnetic water treatment devices in the USA since 1975. The example given is a neutral statement about the spread of these devices. 

Looking at the definitions, Neutral is used when the citation is simply providing information without supporting, comparing, criticizing, or motivating any argument. The example here is purely descriptive, stating a fact about when and where these devices started being used without any further analysis or comparison. 

So, the citation is used neutrally to provide background information without any specific intent beyond that.
