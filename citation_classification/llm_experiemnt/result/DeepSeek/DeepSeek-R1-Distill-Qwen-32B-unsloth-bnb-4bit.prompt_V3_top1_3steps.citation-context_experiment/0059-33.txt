Alright, I need to determine the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by reading the context provided.

The passage says, "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@." The task is to figure out why the citation is used here. 

First, I'll extract the context. The sentence is stating a fact about the spread of magnetic water treatment devices in the USA since 1975 and citing a source for this information. 

Next, I'll identify the general intent. The citation isn't being used to compare anything, support a claim, or motivate future research. It's simply providing a factual statement without any additional analysis or critique. 

Looking at the predefined rhetorical classes, the most fitting one here is "Neutral." The citation is used descriptively to back up a statement without any supporting, comparing, or critical intent. 

So, the label should be Neutral.
