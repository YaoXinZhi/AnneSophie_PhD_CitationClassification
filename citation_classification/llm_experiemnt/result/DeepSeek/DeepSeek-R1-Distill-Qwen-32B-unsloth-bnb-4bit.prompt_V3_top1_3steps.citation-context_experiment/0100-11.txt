Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I'll look at the context provided. The passage is about the development of a new method for detecting plant diseases using hyperspectral imaging. The authors mention that this method is an advancement over previous techniques, specifically citing a 2020 study that used multispectral imaging. They explain that their new approach provides more detailed data by capturing a wider range of the spectrum.

Now, I need to identify the general intent of the citation. The authors are comparing their method to the previous one. They're highlighting that their method is an improvement, which suggests a comparative intent. Specifically, they're comparing the goals or methods of their study with the cited work. 

Looking at the predefined classes, CoCoGM is for comparing goals or methods. Since the authors are explaining how their hyperspectral imaging differs from the multispectral method cited, it fits into this category. They're not comparing results directly or supporting their findings with the cited work; they're setting up their method as an advancement over the previous technique.

So, the most appropriate label here would be CoCoGM because the citation is used to compare the research methods and goals of the cited work with their own.
