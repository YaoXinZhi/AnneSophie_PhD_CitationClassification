Alright, I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage is about a study on the effect of magnetic treatment on scale formation in hard water. The researchers mention that their previous work showed the prevention of scale formation but didn't explain the mechanism. They're now trying to understand the mechanism, citing their own previous study.

Next, I'll determine the general intent. The citation is used to justify why this current research is being conducted. They're pointing out that while they have results, the explanation is missing, hence the motivation for the new study.

Looking at the predefined classes, the closest fit is "Motivation" because they're using the citation to explain the need for their current research by highlighting a knowledge gap.

The citation is used to justify the current research by identifying a knowledge gap, so the rhetorical class is:

Motivation

#OUTPUT
Motivation
