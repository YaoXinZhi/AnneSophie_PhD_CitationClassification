Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let's start by looking at the context provided. The passage mentions that the citation is used to describe the use of magnetic water treatment devices in the USA since 1975. 

First, I'll extract the context. The sentence is: "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@." The citation here is simply providing information about when and where these devices started being used.

Next, I need to identify the general intent. The sentence is purely descriptive; it's stating a fact without any comparison, motivation, support, or criticism. It's just providing background information.

Looking at the predefined classes, the Neutral category fits here because the citation is used in a neutral, descriptive way without supporting, comparing, or criticizing any argument. The other classes like Support, CoCoGM, or Weakness don't apply because there's no comparison, motivation, or criticism involved. It's just stating a fact about the spread of these devices.

So, the most appropriate label is Neutral.
