Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by reading the passage carefully.

The passage says: "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@."

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The sentence is about the spread of magnetic water treatment devices in the USA starting from 1975. The citation is used to back up this statement.

Next, I'll identify the general intent. The citation here seems to be providing a factual statement without any comparison, motivation, or criticism. It's just stating a fact that the use of these devices has been spreading since a specific year.

Now, looking at the predefined rhetorical classes, the example given for "Neutral" is exactly this scenario: the citation is used in a neutral, descriptive way without supporting, comparing, criticizing, or motivating any specific argument. So, the citation is simply providing information without any additional context or intent beyond stating a fact.

Therefore, the most appropriate rhetorical class for this citation is "Neutral."
