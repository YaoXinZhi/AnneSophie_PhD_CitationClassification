Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to classify a citation in a scientific article passage into a specific rhetorical class. The citation is tagged as @@CITATION@@, and I need to determine the most appropriate label from the given list: Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Motivation, Future, Support, Similar, Usage, Weakness, Neutral.

First, I'll start by understanding the context provided. The user has given a passage and wants me to extract the context around the citation, identify the general intent, and then assign the specific rhetorical class.

Looking at the example provided, the passage is:

"In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@."

In this case, the citation is simply providing a factual statement about the spread of magnetic water treatment devices in the USA since 1975. There's no indication of comparing it to another study, supporting a claim, or highlighting any weaknesses. It's a neutral mention to provide background information.

Now, applying the steps:

Step 1: Extract the context. The context is the sentence mentioning the spread of magnetic water treatment devices since 1975, citing the source.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation is used to provide a factual background without any comparison, support, or criticism. It's purely descriptive.

Step 3: Select the specific rhetorical class. Since the citation is used neutrally without supporting, comparing, or criticizing, the label should be Neutral.

I should also consider if there's any possibility of it being another class, like Usage or Support. However, Usage refers to methods or tools, which isn't the case here. Support would imply the citation is backing a claim, which it's not. Therefore, Neutral is the correct classification.
