Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me go through the process step by step.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage is: "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@." The citation is at the end of the sentence, so the context is about the spread of these devices in the USA since 1975.

Next, I need to identify the general intent of the citation. The sentence is providing a factual statement about the spread of magnetic water treatment devices. It's not comparing anything, supporting a claim, or pointing out a weakness. It's just stating a fact.

Looking at the predefined classes, "Neutral" seems to fit here because the citation is used in a descriptive way without supporting, comparing, criticizing, or motivating any specific argument. The sentence is simply providing background information.

So, the rhetorical class should be Neutral.
