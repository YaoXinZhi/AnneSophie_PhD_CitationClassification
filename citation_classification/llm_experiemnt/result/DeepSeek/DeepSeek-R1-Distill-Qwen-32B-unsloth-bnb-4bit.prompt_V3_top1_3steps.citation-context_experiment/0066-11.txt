Okay, I need to determine the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me start by understanding the context and the task.

The context provided is about a study on the hard calcite scale formed by hard water and its prevention using a magnetic field. The authors mention that their previous research showed the prevention but haven't explained the mechanism, so this work aims to understand it.

Looking at the predefined classes, I need to figure out which one fits best. The citation is referring to their own previous work to establish why they're conducting the current research. This is because they're pointing out a gap in their earlier study—the lack of an explanation—which motivates their current work. 

So, the general intent here is motivational. The specific class would be "Motivation" because they're justifying the need for their current research by highlighting a knowledge gap from their past work.

I don't think it's "Basis" because it's not establishing a foundational theory but rather a gap in their own previous findings. It's not a comparison or support for another study, so other classes like CoCoGM or Support don't fit. The key here is that they're motivating their current study by pointing out an unanswered question from their prior work.
