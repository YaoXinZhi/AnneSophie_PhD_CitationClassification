Okay, I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let's start by looking at the context provided.

The passage mentions that the taxonomic status of the species described in the cited work is problematic. It suggests that some species may not develop on Pyrus. So, the author is pointing out that the cited work has issues or limitations in its findings.

Next, I should map this to the predefined classes. The context is critical because it's pointing out a problem with the cited work. The rhetorical class for this would be 'Weakness' since the citation is used to question or point out limitations.

I don't think it's any other class like 'Support' or 'CoCoRes' because the author isn't supporting the cited work or comparing results. Instead, they're highlighting a flaw.

Weakness
