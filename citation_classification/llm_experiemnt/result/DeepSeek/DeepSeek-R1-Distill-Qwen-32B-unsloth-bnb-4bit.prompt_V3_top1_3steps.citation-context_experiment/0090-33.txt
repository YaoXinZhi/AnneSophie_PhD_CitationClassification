Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by reading the context carefully.

The passage says: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@."

Hmm, I need to extract the context around the citation. The key part here is that the experimental setup was described in detail before, and they're citing a previous work. So the context is about referring to a method or setup from another study.

Next, I should identify the general intent. The citation is pointing to a previous description of their experimental setup. That sounds like they're using the cited work as a reference for their methods. So the intent here is probably related to usage, since they're referring to a method or setup used in their current study.

Looking at the predefined classes, Usage is the one that fits here. Usage refers to citing a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup from another work that's directly used in the current study. In this case, the authors are saying they described their setup in detail before, so they're citing that previous work where the setup was first detailed.

I don't think it's any of the other classes. It's not a comparison (CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY), motivation, future direction, support, similarity, weakness, or neutral. It's clearly about using a previous method, so Usage is the best fit.
