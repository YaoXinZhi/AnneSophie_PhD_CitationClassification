Alright, I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the authors found fast multiplication rates and high concentrations of two strains in young leaves and roots, referencing Wei et al., 2004. However, they also note conflicting results from another study by Saracco et al., 2006, which is the citation in question. So, the context is about contrasting results between two studies.

Next, I need to identify the general intent. The passage is comparing results from two different studies. Wei et al. reported high concentrations, while Saracco et al. found conflicting results. This is a direct comparison of findings, so it falls under a comparative intent.

Looking at the specific rhetorical classes, the options are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, etc. Since the citation is comparing two studies' results, it's a comparison of explanations or claims. That points to CoCoXY.

So, the rhetorical class for @@CITATION@@ here is CoCoXY because it's comparing two cited studies to show conflicting results.
