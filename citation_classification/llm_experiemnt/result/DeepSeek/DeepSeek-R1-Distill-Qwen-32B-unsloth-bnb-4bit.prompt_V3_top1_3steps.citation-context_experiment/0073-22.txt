Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me go through the steps one by one.

First, I need to extract the context discussing the citation. The passage is about the multiplication rates of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains in young leaves and roots of infected daisy plants, citing Wei et al., 2004, and conflicting results from another study. The sentence mentions that conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima, citing @@CITATION@@.

So, the context is comparing two studies: one that found high multiplication rates and another that found conflicting results. The citation is part of this comparison.

Next, I need to identify the general intent. The passage is comparing two cited studies, so it's a comparative intent. Now, looking at the specific rhetorical classes under comparative, there are CoCoGM, CoCoRes, and CoCoXY.

CoCoXY is used when comparing two cited studies with each other, not with the citing paper. In this case, the passage is comparing Wei et al. and another study, so it's CoCoXY.

Therefore, the rhetorical class is CoCoXY.
