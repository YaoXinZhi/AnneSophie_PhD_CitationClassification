Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific article passage. Let me go through the steps one by one.

First, I need to extract the context discussing the citation. The passage is about plant health and mentions a study where a phytoplasma strain was reported in young leaves and roots of daisy plants. It also notes conflicting results described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima, citing @@CITATION@@.

Next, I should identify the general intent of the citation. The context is comparing two studies: one where fast multiplication rates were found in certain parts, and another where conflicting results were found in a different plant. The citation is used to show that there's a discrepancy between these two studies. 

Now, looking at the rhetorical classes, this seems like a comparison between two cited works. The example given for CoCoXY is when two cited studies are compared with each other, not with the citing paper. In this case, the passage is comparing the results of Wei et al. and Saracco et al., pointing out that their findings conflict. So, the citation is used to compare the explanations or claims of these two studies.

Therefore, the rhetorical class should be CoCoXY because it's comparing two cited works to highlight conflicting results.
