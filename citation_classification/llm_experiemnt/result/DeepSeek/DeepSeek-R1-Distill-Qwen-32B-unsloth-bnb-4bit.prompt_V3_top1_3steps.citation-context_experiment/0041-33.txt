Okay, I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me start by understanding the context provided. The passage mentions that the citation is about the use of magnetic water treatment devices in the USA since 1975. The example given is a neutral statement, just providing information without any supporting, comparing, or criticizing the cited work.

So, looking at the definitions, the Neutral class is for when the citation is used descriptively without any specific argument or intent. Since the passage is simply stating a fact about the spread of these devices without any further analysis or comparison, it fits the Neutral category. There's no motivation, support, or comparison involved here. It's just a factual reference.

Therefore, the appropriate rhetorical class for this citation is Neutral.
