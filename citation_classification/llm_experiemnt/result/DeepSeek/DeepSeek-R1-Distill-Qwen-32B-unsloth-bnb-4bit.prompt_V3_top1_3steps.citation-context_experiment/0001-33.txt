Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by reading the passage carefully.

The passage says: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@."

Alright, so the context here is about the experimental setup. The authors are referencing a previous work where they had detailed the setup. The key here is that they're pointing to a method or tool used in their current study.

Looking at the predefined classes, I need to match this to one of them. The example given for 'Usage' is when a citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup that is directly used in the current study. That seems to fit here because the authors are using the cited work's experimental setup in their current research.

So, the general intent is to reference a tool or method used. Therefore, the rhetorical class should be 'Usage'.
