Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me go through the steps.

First, I extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the authors found a specific pathogen in a plant and reference the citation. They're comparing their findings with previous research, noting that the pathogen was previously identified in another plant species. 

Next, I identify the general intent. They're pointing out a similarity between their results and those of the cited work. The citation supports their finding by showing that the same pathogen has been observed elsewhere, which adds credibility to their results.

Looking at the rhetorical classes, "Similar" is used when the citation points out a similarity in results or findings. Since the authors are highlighting that their discovery aligns with previous studies, this fits the "Similar" category.
