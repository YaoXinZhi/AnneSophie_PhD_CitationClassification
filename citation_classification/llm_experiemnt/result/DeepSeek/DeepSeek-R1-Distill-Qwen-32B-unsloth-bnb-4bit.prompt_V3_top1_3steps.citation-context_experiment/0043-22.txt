Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me start by understanding the task.

First, the context provided is a passage from a scientific article. I need to extract the part that discusses the citation @@CITATION@@. The passage is about the multiplication rates and conflicting results regarding phytoplasma in different plants. The sentence mentions that conflicting results were described in a study, citing @@CITATION@@.

Next, I have to identify the general intent of the citation. The example given in the context is that conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima, citing the study. So, the citation is used to compare two studies' results.

Looking at the predefined rhetorical classes, the one that fits here is CoCoRes, which is used when the citation compares the results or findings of the cited work with another cited study. The example given for CoCoRes is exactly this kind of comparison between two studies' results.

So, putting it all together, the citation is used to compare conflicting results from two studies, which falls under CoCoRes.
