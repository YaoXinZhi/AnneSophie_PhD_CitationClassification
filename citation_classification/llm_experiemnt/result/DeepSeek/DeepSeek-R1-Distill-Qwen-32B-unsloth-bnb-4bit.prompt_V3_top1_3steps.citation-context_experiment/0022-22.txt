Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by understanding the context and the task.

First, the passage is about plant health, specifically mentioning the usage of magnetic treatment to prevent hard calcite scale formation. The authors are referencing their previous work to explain why they're conducting this new study. They mention that while their previous research showed that magnetic fields can prevent scale formation, the mechanism behind it isn't understood yet. So, this current work aims to explore that mechanism.

Looking at the definitions, the general intent here seems to be Motivational because they're citing their past work to justify why this new research is necessary. They're pointing out a gap in knowledgeâ€”the lack of an explanation for their previous findings. That fits under Motivation as it's identifying a need for further research.

I should also consider if it could be another class. Could it be Basis? Well, Basis is about intellectual foundation, but here they're not building on previous work as a foundation but rather pointing out a gap. Support? No, because they're not confirming their current findings with the citation. Usage? They're not using a method from the cited work. So, Motivation seems the best fit.
