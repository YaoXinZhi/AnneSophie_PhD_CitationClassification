Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me go through the steps carefully.

First, I'll look at the context provided. The passage says that the citation is used to point out that eighteen species were described from China, but the taxonomic status is problematic, and some may not develop on Pyrus. 

Step 1: Extract the context. The context mentions that the citation describes species collected on pear, but their taxonomic status is problematic. So the focus is on the cited work's findings and their limitations.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The passage is pointing out that the cited work's results are problematic or unclear. This seems to be a critical or analytical intent because it's questioning the cited work's conclusions.

Step 3: Select the specific rhetorical class. The options are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Motivation, Future, Support, Similar, Usage, Weakness, Neutral. Since the context is criticizing the cited work's taxonomic status as problematic, the appropriate class is Weakness.

I think that's it. The citation is used to highlight a flaw or limitation in the cited study.

Weakness
