Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me go through the steps as outlined.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage is about plant health, specifically discussing the multiplication rates and concentration of two strains of 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' in infected daisy plants. It mentions that conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima, citing @@CITATION@@.

Now, looking at the general intent. The context is comparing two studies: one that reports high multiplication rates and another that describes conflicting results. The citation is used to show that there's a discrepancy between studies. This seems like a comparison between two cited works rather than comparing with the current paper.

Looking at the predefined classes, the specific rhetorical class for comparing two cited studies is CoCoXY. The example given for CoCoXY is exactly this kind of situation where conflicting results from different studies are highlighted.

So, the general intent is Comparative, and the specific class is CoCoXY because it's comparing two cited studies to show conflicting findings.
