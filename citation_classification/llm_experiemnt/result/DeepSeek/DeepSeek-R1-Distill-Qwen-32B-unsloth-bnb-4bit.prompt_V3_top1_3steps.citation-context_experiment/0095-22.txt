Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by understanding the task. The user wants me to classify the citation into one of the predefined categories based on how it's used in the context.

First, I'll look at the passage provided. The context is about plant health, specifically discussing the use of magnetic fields to prevent scale formation. The sentence says, "Our previous research @@CITATION@@ has shown that the formation of the hard calcite scale on the surfaces exposed to hard water can be successfully prevented with the applied magnetic field." 

Alright, so the citation is referring to their own previous research. The intent here is to establish that their current work builds upon this earlier finding. They're not comparing methods or results with others; instead, they're using their past work as a foundation for the current study.

Looking at the categories, "Basis" seems appropriate because it's about referencing the intellectual foundation of the current research. The example given for Basis is almost identical to this context, where previous research is cited to introduce the current study's purpose.

I don't think it's any of the other categories. It's not a comparison (so not CoCoGM, CoCoRes, or CoCoXY), nor is it motivational or future-oriented. It's not supporting or similar to another study, nor is it usage of a method or pointing out a weakness. It's purely foundational.

So, the most appropriate label here is "Basis."
