Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by reading the passage carefully. The passage says, "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@@."

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The main point here is that the current study's finding is supported by another study. The citation is mentioned right after stating that their finding is supported by recent investigations. So the context is about supporting their results with another study's findings.

Next, I need to identify the general intent. The citation is used to confirm or back up their own results, which suggests a supportive intent. Looking at the predefined classes, Support is about citing work that confirms or supports the current findings.

Now, checking the specific class definitions. The Support class is when the citation is used to support the citing authors' work. The example given is similar, where another study's findings back up the current results. In this case, the cited work supports the idea that insect hosts affect bacterial assembly, just like the current study's findings.

I don't think it's any other class like CoCoRes because it's not comparing results directly but rather supporting them. It's not about methods, motivation, or usage. So the most appropriate label here is Support.
