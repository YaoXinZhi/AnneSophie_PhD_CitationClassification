Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me start by understanding the task. The context is a passage from a scientific article, and the citation is embedded within it. My job is to determine the rhetorical class of that citation based on how it's used in the passage.

First, I'll read the passage carefully to extract the context around the citation. The passage is about the use of magnetic water treatment devices in the USA. It mentions that their use has been spreading since 1975 and cites a reference. The sentence structure is straightforward: it's stating a fact about the spread of these devices and providing a citation for that information.

Next, I need to identify the general intent of the citation. The passage isn't comparing this with other studies, nor is it supporting or motivating its own research. It's simply providing a factual statement about when the use of these devices started to spread. So, the intent here is descriptive.

Looking at the predefined rhetorical classes, "Neutral" is used when the citation is mentioned in a neutral, descriptive way without any supporting, comparing, criticizing, or motivating arguments. Since the citation is just providing a factual piece of information without any additional analysis or comparison, "Neutral" seems appropriate.

I should also consider if any other classes might fit. For example, "Usage" is when the citation refers to a method or tool used in the current study, but here it's about the spread of devices, not their usage in a study. "Support" would be if the citation was backing up a claim, but that's not the case here. Similarly, "Motivation" or "Future" aren't applicable because there's no discussion of why the research is being done or future directions.

Therefore, the most appropriate rhetorical class for this citation is "Neutral."
