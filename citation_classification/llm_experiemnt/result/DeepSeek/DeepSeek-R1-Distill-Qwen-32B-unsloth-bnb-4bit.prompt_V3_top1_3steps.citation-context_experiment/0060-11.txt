Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I'll look at the context provided. The passage says: "The taxonomic status of these species is problematic and some may not develop on Pyrus @@CITATION@@." The citation is right after a statement that criticizes the taxonomic status of certain species, suggesting that some might not develop on Pyrus.

Now, looking at the general intent. The sentence is pointing out that the cited work's findings are problematic. It's not just stating a fact but is actually questioning the validity or accuracy of the cited research. So, this seems critical.

Next, I'll map this to the predefined classes. The options are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Motivation, Future, Support, Similar, Usage, Weakness, Neutral. The sentence is criticizing the cited work, so it's pointing out a weakness or limitation in their findings. Therefore, the rhetorical class should be Weakness.

I don't think it's any of the other classes because it's not comparing methods or results, supporting the current work, or anything like that. It's directly pointing out a flaw in the cited study.

Weakness
