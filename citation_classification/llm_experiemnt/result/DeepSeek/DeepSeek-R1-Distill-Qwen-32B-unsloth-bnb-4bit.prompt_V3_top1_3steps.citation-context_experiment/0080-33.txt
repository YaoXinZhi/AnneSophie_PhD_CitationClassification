Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I'll extract the context. The passage says: "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@@."

So, the main point here is that the authors' finding about insect hosts affecting bacterial communities is supported by other studies. They mention that in fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governs bacterial assemblages, which supports their own findings.

Next, I need to identify the general intent. The citation is used to support the authors' results, so it's supportive. Now, looking at the specific classes, Support is when the citation confirms the work of the citing authors. In this case, the authors are pointing out that their findings align with previous research, which fits the Support category.

I don't think it's Similar because they're not just pointing out a similarity; they're actively using the citation to back up their own results. It's not Usage because they're not using a method or tool from the cited work. It's definitely not Weakness since they're not criticizing the cited work. So, the best fit is Support.
