Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific article passage. Let's start by understanding the context. The passage mentions that the citation is used to compare two studies regarding conflicting results about a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima. 

So, the first step is to extract the context. The key part is that there are conflicting results between the cited works. One study reports fast multiplication rates and high concentration, while another describes conflicting results for a different phytoplasma. The citation is used to highlight this discrepancy.

Next, I need to identify the general intent. Since the citation is comparing two studies' findings, it's a comparative intent. Now, looking at the specific rhetorical classes, CoCoRes is about comparing results, but in this case, it's comparing two cited studies with each other, not with the citing paper. That makes it CoCoXY, which is used when comparing two cited works.

So, the label should be CoCoXY because it's comparing explanations or claims between two studies cited in the passage.
