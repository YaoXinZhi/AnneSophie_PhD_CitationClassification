Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by understanding the context.

The passage is about the use of magnetic fields to prevent hard calcite scale formation. It mentions that previous research showed this prevention but didn't explain the mechanism. The current work aims to understand this mechanism.

Looking at the context, the citation is used to establish that the phenomenon exists, which is the foundation for the current research. It's not comparing methods, supporting a claim, or pointing out weaknesses. It's simply stating prior work that this study builds upon.

So, the general intent is Foundational. From the predefined list, the appropriate label is Basis.
