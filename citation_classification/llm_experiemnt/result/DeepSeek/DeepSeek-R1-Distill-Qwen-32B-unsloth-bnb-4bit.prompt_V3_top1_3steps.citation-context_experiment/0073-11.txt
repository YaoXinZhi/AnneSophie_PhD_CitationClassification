Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the context is about the classification of plant pathogens into different groups based on their genomic and phenotypic characteristics. The passage mentions that the authors used a method similar to a previous study, and they reference @@CITATION@@ for that. 

Step 1: Extracting the context. The relevant part is that the authors used a method similar to a previous study and cited @@CITATION@@. The key point here is that they're pointing out a similarity between their method and the cited work.

Step 2: Identifying the general intent. Since they're pointing out that their method is similar to the cited study, this seems to be a similarity in methods or approach. So the general intent is supportive, as they're showing that their work aligns with previous research.

Step 3: Selecting the specific rhetorical class. The predefined classes include 'Similar', which is used when the citation points out a similarity between the cited work and the current paper. In this case, the similarity is about the method used, so 'Similar' fits here.

I think that's it. The citation is used to show that their method is similar to a previous study, which supports their approach by aligning it with established methods.
