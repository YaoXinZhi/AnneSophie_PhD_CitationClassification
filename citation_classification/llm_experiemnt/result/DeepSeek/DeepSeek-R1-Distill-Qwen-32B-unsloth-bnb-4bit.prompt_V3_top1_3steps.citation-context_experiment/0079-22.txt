Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the context provided is a passage from a scientific article. The task is to determine the rhetorical class of the citation. The passage mentions that the citation is used to compare or contrast two studies with each other, not with the current paper. The example given is about conflicting results regarding phytoplasma in different plant species. 

Looking at the definitions, CoCoXY is for when the citation is used to compare or contrast two cited studies. In this case, the passage is discussing conflicting results from two different studies, so it's comparing them. 

I should also consider other classes to make sure I'm not mixing them up. For example, CoCoRes is about comparing results with the citing paper, but here it's comparing two cited works. So CoCoXY fits better. 

Therefore, the rhetorical class is CoCoXY.
