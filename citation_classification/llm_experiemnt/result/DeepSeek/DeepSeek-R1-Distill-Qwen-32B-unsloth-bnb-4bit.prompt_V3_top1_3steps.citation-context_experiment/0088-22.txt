Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me go through the steps one by one.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage is about how the formation of hard calcite scale on surfaces exposed to hard water can be prevented with a magnetic field. The authors mention that their previous research showed this prevention but haven't explained the mechanism yet. They're now trying to understand it. The citation is used when they refer to their own previous work.

Next, I need to identify the general intent. The citation here is explaining why they're conducting this researchâ€”because they saw an effect but don't know why. So it's about motivation, specifically identifying a knowledge gap.

Looking at the predefined classes, Motivation is the right category because it's justifying why the current research is being done by pointing out an unanswered question from their prior work.

I don't think it's any other category like Support or Basis because they're not confirming their results or establishing a foundation. It's more about why they're doing the study now.

The citation is used to justify the current research by highlighting a knowledge gap from previous work, which fits the Motivation category.

**Answer: Motivation**
