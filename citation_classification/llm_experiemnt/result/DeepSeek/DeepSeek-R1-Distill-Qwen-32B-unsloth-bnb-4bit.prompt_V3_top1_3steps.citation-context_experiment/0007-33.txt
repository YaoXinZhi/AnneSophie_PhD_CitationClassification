Okay, I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the context is a sentence that says, "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." My task is to extract the context and understand the intent of the citation.

Looking at the sentence, it's clear that the authors are referring to a previous work where the experimental setup was detailed. They're using this citation to reference a method or tool that they're using in their current study. So, the citation is pointing to a method or setup that they're adopting.

Now, I need to identify the general intent. The options are foundational, comparative, motivational, supportive, technical, critical/analytical, or descriptive. In this case, the citation is about a method used, so it's technical.

Next, looking at the specific rhetorical classes, the one that fits here is "Usage." The citation refers to a method or tool from the cited work that is directly used in the current study. The example given for Usage is exactly this scenario: citing a previous work that describes the experimental setup used in the current research.

I don't think it's any of the other classes because it's not comparing methods, supporting a result, or pointing out a weakness. It's purely about using a previously described setup, which falls under Usage.
