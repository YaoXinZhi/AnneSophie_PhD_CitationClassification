Okay, I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me start by extracting the context around the citation.

The passage says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@."

So, the context is about comparing the results of the current study with previous experiments. The key words here are "results obtained," "substantially differ," and "results of the experiments." This indicates that the authors are directly contrasting their findings with those of the cited work.

Now, looking at the general intent, this seems to be a comparison of results. Comparing results is one of the comparative intents, which falls under the CoCoRes category. The other options don't fit as well: it's not about motivation, support, or usage. It's specifically about contrasting findings, so CoCoRes is the most appropriate.

I don't think it's CoCoGM because that's about goals or methods, not results. Similarly, it's not CoCoXY because that's comparing two cited studies, not the current work with a cited one. So, CoCoRes is the right choice here.
