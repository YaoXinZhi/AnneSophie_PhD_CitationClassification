Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me go through the steps as outlined.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage says: "Eighteen species, collected on cultivated and wild pear, were described from China @@CITATION@@. The taxonomic status of these species is problematic and some may not develop on Pyrus."

Looking at this, the citation is about species described from China. The next sentence mentions that the taxonomic status is problematic, implying that there are issues with the cited work's findings.

Next, I need to identify the general intent. The sentence after the citation points out a problem with the taxonomic status, suggesting criticism or questioning of the cited study's results. That makes me think it's a Critical/Analytical intent.

Now, looking at the specific rhetorical classes, the one that fits here is "Weakness," as the citation is used to point out limitations or flaws in the cited work.

So, putting it all together, the rhetorical class for this citation is "Weakness."
