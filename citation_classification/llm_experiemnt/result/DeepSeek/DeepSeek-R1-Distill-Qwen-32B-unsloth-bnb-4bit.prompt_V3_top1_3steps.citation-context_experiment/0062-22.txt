Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in this passage. Let's go through the steps.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the citation discusses the presence of 18 species of pear psyllids in China, but notes that the taxonomic status is problematic, implying some may not develop on Pyrus. 

Next, I should identify the general intent. The author is pointing out a weakness in the cited work by saying the taxonomic status is unclear or problematic. 

Now, mapping this to the predefined classes, this seems like the "Weakness" category because the citation is used to highlight a limitation or flaw in the cited study.

The citation is used to point out a limitation in the cited work, indicating a problematic taxonomic status. 

**Answer:** Weakness
