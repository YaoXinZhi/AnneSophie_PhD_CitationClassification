Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me start by carefully reading the context provided.

The context is: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@."

Hmm, I need to break this down. The sentence is talking about the experimental setup and mentions that it was described in detail in a previous citation. So, the authors are referring to a prior work where they had explained their setup.

Looking at the predefined classes, I should see which one fits best. The options are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Motivation, Future, Support, Similar, Usage, Weakness, Neutral.

The sentence is about using a method or setup from a previous study. The authors are not comparing their results or methods with others, nor are they supporting or motivating their current work with this citation. They're simply stating that the setup was detailed in a prior paper, which suggests they're using the previous work's setup in their current study.

Looking at the 'Usage' class, the definition says it's when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup used in the current study. The example given is exactly like this: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@."

So, this fits the 'Usage' category because they're referencing a prior method or setup that they are using in their current work.
