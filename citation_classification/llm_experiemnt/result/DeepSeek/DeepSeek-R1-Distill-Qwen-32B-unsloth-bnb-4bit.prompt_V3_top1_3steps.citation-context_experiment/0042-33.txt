Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by reading the passage carefully.

The passage says: "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@@."

Alright, so the authors are talking about their finding regarding insect hosts affecting bacterial assembly. They mention that this is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations, specifically citing another study about fleas and ticks where the host governed bacterial assemblages. 

Looking at the context, the citation is used to back up their own findings. They're saying that their results align with what others have found in similar studies. So, the purpose here is to support their work with existing research.

Now, looking at the predefined classes, 'Support' is when the citation is used to confirm or back up the citing authors' work. The example given for 'Support' is very similar: citing another study that aligns with their findings, which is exactly what's happening here.

I don't think it's 'Similar' because 'Similar' is more about pointing out a similarity rather than supporting the findings. 'Support' is more about confirming the results. It's also not 'CoCoRes' because they aren't directly comparing their results with the cited work; they're just saying their finding is supported by it.

So, the most appropriate label here is 'Support'.
