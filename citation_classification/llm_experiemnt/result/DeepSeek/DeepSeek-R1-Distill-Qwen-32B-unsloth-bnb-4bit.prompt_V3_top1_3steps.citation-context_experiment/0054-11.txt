Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me go through the steps.

First, I'll extract the context. The passage says that the study found that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly, referencing @@CITATION@@. It mentions that this finding is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations in fleas and ticks, where the host governed bacterial assemblages.

Now, identifying the general intent. The citation is used to back up their finding with similar results from other studies. So it's supporting their work.

Looking at the predefined classes, the most appropriate seems to be "Support" because they're confirming their results with another study's findings.
