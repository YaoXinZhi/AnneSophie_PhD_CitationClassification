Okay, I need to determine the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let's start by extracting the context.

The passage mentions that the citation discusses the multiplication rates and conflicting results of a phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima. The authors are pointing out that while some studies show high rates, others describe conflicting findings. 

Looking at the definitions, CoCoXY is used when comparing two cited studies with each other. In this case, the authors are contrasting the results from different studies, so it's a comparison of explanations or claims between the cited works. 

So, the rhetorical class here is CoCoXY.
