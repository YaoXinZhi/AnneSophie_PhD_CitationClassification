Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific article passage. Let me start by understanding the context and the task.

First, the task is to assign a rhetorical class to the citation based on how it's used in the passage. The predefined classes are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Motivation, Future, Support, Similar, Usage, Weakness, and Neutral.

Looking at the example provided, the passage says: "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@@."

So, the citation is used right after the sentence that mentions support from other investigations. The key part is "is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria." The authors are pointing out that their finding is consistent with other studies, specifically citing the work of other researchers.

In the example, the authors mention their own finding and then say it's supported by recent investigations, which are cited. This indicates that the citation is being used to back up their results, showing that their findings align with existing research.

Now, looking at the definitions:

- Support: The citation is used to support the work, result, or finding of the citing authors. The example given for Support is when a study's results are consistent with previous research, which is exactly what's happening here.

So, the citation is being used to support the authors' findings by referencing similar studies. Therefore, the rhetorical class should be Support.

I don't think it's any of the other classes because it's not comparing methods (CoCoGM), results (CoCoRes), or explanations (CoCoXY). It's not a foundational work (Basis), nor is it motivating future work or pointing out weaknesses. It's simply supporting their own findings with prior research.
