Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by extracting the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the study by @@CITATION@@ found that the use of magnetic fields can prevent hard calcite scale formation on surfaces exposed to hard water. The current work aims to explain the mechanism behind this phenomenon, building on the previous research.

Now, looking at the general intent, the citation is used to justify why this current research is being conducted. It points out that while the previous study showed that magnetic fields prevent scaling, the mechanism isn't understood yet. So, the current research is motivated by filling this knowledge gap.

Next, mapping this to the predefined classes, the Motivation category fits because the citation identifies a knowledge gap that the current study aims to address. The example given for Motivation is similar, where previous research showed a phenomenon but didn't explain it, prompting further investigation.

I don't think it's any of the other classes like Support or Basis because it's not confirming a result or providing foundational theory. It's more about why the research is necessary now. So, the appropriate label is Motivation.
