Okay, I need to determine the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the context mentions that the cited work (Saracco et al., 2006) reported conflicting results about the phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima. The passage is comparing two studies: one by Wei et al., 2004, and another by Saracco et al., 2006. The key point is that the results are conflicting.

Looking at the definitions, CoCoXY is about comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies, not necessarily with the citing paper. Here, the citation is used to point out the conflicting results between the two studies. So, it's a comparison between the two cited works.

Other options like CoCoRes involve comparing results with the current paper, but here it's between two other studies. So, the correct class is CoCoXY.
