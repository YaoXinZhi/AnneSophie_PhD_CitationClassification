Alright, I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I'll look at the context provided. The passage says, "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@." The citation here is simply providing a fact about when and where the use of these devices started. It's a straightforward statement without any indication of comparison, support, motivation, or criticism.

Next, I need to identify the general intent. The citation isn't being used to compare methods or results, nor is it supporting or contradicting any claims. It's just stating a historical fact. So, the intent seems to be descriptive.

Now, looking at the predefined classes, "Neutral" is the category where the citation is used in a neutral, descriptive way without supporting, comparing, criticizing, or motivating any specific argument. This fits because the citation is merely providing background information without any further analysis or comparison.

I don't see any elements of comparison, support, motivation, or criticism here. It's purely informative, so the most appropriate label is Neutral.
