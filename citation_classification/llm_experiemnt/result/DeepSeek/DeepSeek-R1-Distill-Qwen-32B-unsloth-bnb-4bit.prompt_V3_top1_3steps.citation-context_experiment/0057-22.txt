Alright, I need to determine the rhetorical class of the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me go through the steps carefully.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the taxonomic status of the eighteen species is problematic, and some may not develop on Pyrus. The citation is given right after this statement, so it's referring to the description of these species.

Next, I'll identify the general intent. The passage is pointing out that the taxonomic status is problematic, which suggests criticism or questioning of the cited work. This points towards a critical or analytical intent.

Now, selecting the specific rhetorical class. Since the citation is used to highlight a limitation or issue with the cited work, the appropriate class is Weakness.
</think>

The citation is used to criticize the taxonomic status described in the cited work, pointing out its problematic nature.

Weakness
