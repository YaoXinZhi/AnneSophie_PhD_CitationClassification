Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to classify the citation in the given passage. Let's start by looking at the context provided. The passage says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@."

So, the key part here is that the current work's results are being compared to the results of previous experiments. The phrase "substantially differ from" indicates a direct comparison between the findings of two studies. 

Now, looking at the predefined classes, the one that stands out is CoCoRes, which is used when the citation is comparing or contrasting the results or findings of the cited work with the current paper. The example given for CoCoRes is almost identical to this scenario, where the results of the present work are compared to a previous study.

I don't think it's any of the other classes like CoCoGM (goals/methods) or CoCoXY (comparing two cited studies) because it's specifically about results. It's not a motivation, support, or weakness either. So, the most appropriate label here is CoCoRes.
