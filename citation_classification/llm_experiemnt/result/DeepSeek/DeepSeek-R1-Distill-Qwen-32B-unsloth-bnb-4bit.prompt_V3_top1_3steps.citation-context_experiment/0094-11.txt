Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me go through the steps one by one.

First, I need to extract the context discussing the citation. The passage is about the use of magnetic water treatment devices in the USA since 1975, and it's cited as @@CITATION@@. The context is pretty straightforwardâ€”it's a factual statement about the spread of these devices.

Next, I need to identify the general intent of the citation. The sentence is simply stating a fact without any additional commentary or comparison. It's just providing information about when and where the use of these devices started. There's no indication that the citation is being used to support, compare, motivate, or critique anything. It's just a neutral mention.

Now, looking at the predefined rhetorical classes, I need to match this context. The options are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Motivation, Future, Support, Similar, Usage, Weakness, Neutral. Since the citation is used to provide a neutral fact without any argumentative or comparative purpose, the most appropriate class here is Neutral.
