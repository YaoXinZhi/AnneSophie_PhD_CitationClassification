Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me start by understanding the process.

First, I should extract the context discussing the citation. The passage is about the multiplication rates and conflicting results in studies on phytoplasma. It mentions two studies, one by Wei et al. (2004) and another by Saracco et al. (2006), and then refers to conflicting results in another study @@CITATION@@.

Next, I need to identify the general intent. The context is comparing results from different studies. The first two studies report high rates in certain parts, while the cited study shows conflicting results elsewhere. This seems like a comparison between the cited works, not directly with the current paper.

Now, looking at the rhetorical classes, CoCoXY is for comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies. Since the passage is contrasting the results of Wei et al. and Saracco et al. with another study, it fits CoCoXY.

So, the label should be CoCoXY.

The citation is used to compare conflicting results between studies, fitting the CoCoXY category.

CoCoXY
