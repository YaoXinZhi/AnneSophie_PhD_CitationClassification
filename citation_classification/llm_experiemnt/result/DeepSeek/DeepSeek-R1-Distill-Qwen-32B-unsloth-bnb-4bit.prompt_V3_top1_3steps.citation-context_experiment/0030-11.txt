Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let's start by understanding the task. The user provided a detailed process, so I should follow each step carefully.

First, I need to extract the context discussing the citation. The passage is within backticks, so I'll look for that. The context given is: "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@." 

Next, I have to identify the general intent of the citation. The sentence is stating a fact about the spread of magnetic water treatment devices in the USA since 1975, citing a source. The citation here is simply providing information without supporting, comparing, motivating, or criticizing anything. It's a neutral statement.

Looking at the predefined rhetorical classes, the most appropriate one seems to be Neutral because the citation is used descriptively without any specific argument or comparison. The example provided for Neutral matches this scenario exactly, where the citation is just adding factual information without any particular intent beyond description.

I don't see any elements of comparison, support, motivation, or criticism here. It's purely informative. So, the rhetorical class should be Neutral.
