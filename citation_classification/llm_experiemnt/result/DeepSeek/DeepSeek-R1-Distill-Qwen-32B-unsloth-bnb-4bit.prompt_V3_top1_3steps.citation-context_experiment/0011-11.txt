Alright, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by carefully reading the passage to understand the context.

The passage says, "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@." Hmm, okay, so the sentence is providing a fact about the spread of magnetic water treatment devices in the USA since 1975, and it's citing a source for that information.

Now, I need to break this down step by step. First, I'll extract the context. The context here is about the spread of magnetic water treatment devices in the USA since 1975, and the citation is supporting this statement.

Next, I have to identify the general intent of the citation. The sentence is simply stating a fact without comparing, supporting, or motivating anything else. It's just providing information that's backed by a citation. So the intent seems to be descriptive rather than argumentative or comparative.

Looking at the predefined rhetorical classes, I need to see which one fits best. The options are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Motivation, Future, Support, Similar, Usage, Weakness, Neutral.

- Basis: This is for foundational work. The citation here isn't introducing a new foundation but just stating a fact.
- CoCoGM/CoCoRes/CoCoXY: These are for comparisons, which isn't happening here.
- Motivation: This is about justifying why the research is being done, which isn't the case here.
- Future: Suggesting future research, which isn't happening.
- Support: Citing to support a claim. Here, it's just stating a fact, so maybe?
- Similar: Pointing out similarities, which isn't the case.
- Usage: Referring to methods or tools, which isn't the case here.
- Weakness: Criticizing the cited work, which isn't happening.
- Neutral: Used in a neutral, descriptive way without supporting or comparing.

Wait, the example for Neutral is exactly this kind of situation: "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@." The citation is just providing a factual statement without any argumentative intent. So it's a Neutral citation.

I think that's the correct classification because the citation is simply adding a fact without any comparison, support, or motivation. It's just stating that the use has been spreading since 1975, citing a source for that information.
