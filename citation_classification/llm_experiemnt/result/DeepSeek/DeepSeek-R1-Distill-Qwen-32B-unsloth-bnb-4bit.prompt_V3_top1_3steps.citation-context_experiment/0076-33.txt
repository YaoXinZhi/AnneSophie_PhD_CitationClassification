Alright, I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by understanding the context. The passage mentions that the citation is used to point out a similarity between the cited work and the current paper, specifically regarding the factors influencing bacterial assemblages in different insects. 

Next, I'll look at the general intent. The citation is highlighting a similarity in results or patterns, which falls under the Supportive category. Now, looking at the specific rhetorical classes, the example given under Similar is about supporting findings with cross-taxon investigations. 

So, the citation is supporting the current paper's findings by pointing out a similar result from another study. That makes it a Support case rather than Similar, because it's not just noting a similarity but using it to back up their own results.

The citation is used to support the current paper's findings by pointing out a similarity in results from another study. This supports their argument, so the label is Support.
