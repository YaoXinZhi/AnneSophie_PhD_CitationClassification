Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the passage says: "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@@."

Step 1: Extract the context. The sentence mentions that their finding is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations. They are pointing out that similar findings exist in other studies on fleas and ticks, citing the work.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation is used to back up their own findings, showing that other studies have similar results. This seems supportive.

Step 3: Choose the specific rhetorical class. Looking at the definitions, "Support" is when the citation confirms or supports the current work's findings. Here, the citation is used to support their conclusion about insect hosts affecting bacterial assembly. It's not a comparison of methods or results, nor is it a motivation or a weakness. It's directly supporting their own findings with similar results from others.

So, the most appropriate label is "Support."

The citation is used to support the current paper's findings by referencing similar results from other studies. 

**Support**
