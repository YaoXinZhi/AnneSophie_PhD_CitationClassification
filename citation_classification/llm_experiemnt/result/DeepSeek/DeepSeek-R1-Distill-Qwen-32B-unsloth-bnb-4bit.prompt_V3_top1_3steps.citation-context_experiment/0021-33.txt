Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let's go through the steps one by one.

First, I should extract the context discussing the citation. The passage says: "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@@."

So the context is about supporting a finding. The authors mention that their finding is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations, specifically citing another study.

Next, I need to identify the general intent. The citation is used to back up their own results, so the intent is supportive.

Now, looking at the predefined classes, Support is when the citation supports or confirms the work of the citing authors. The example given for Support is exactly this scenario: citing another study that supports their findings.

So the appropriate label here is Support.

The citation is used to support the authors' findings by referencing another study's results, which align with theirs.

Support
