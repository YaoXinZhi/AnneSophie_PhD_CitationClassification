Alright, I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me go through the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Extract the context discussing the citation. The context is: "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@@."

So, the main point here is that the current study's finding is supported by other investigations. The citation is being used to back up their results.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation is supporting the current work's findings. So, the intent is supportive.

Step 3: Select the specific rhetorical class. Looking at the definitions, 'Support' is when the citation is used to confirm or back up the citing authors' work. The example given for Support is similar, where another study's findings align with the current study's results. In this case, the cited work supports the current findings about insect hosts affecting bacterial assembly.

So, the appropriate label is 'Support'.
