Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by understanding the context. The passage is about a study on the formation of hard calcite scale on surfaces exposed to hard water and how magnetic fields can prevent it. The researchers mention that their previous work showed this prevention but didn't explain the mechanism, so they're conducting this new study to understand it better.

Now, the citation @@CITATION@@ is referenced in the sentence: "Our previous research @@CITATION@@ has shown that the formation of the hard calcite scale on the surfaces exposed to hard water can be successfully prevented with the applied magnetic field." 

Looking at the context, the citation is being used to justify why the current research is being conducted. They're pointing out that while their previous work demonstrated the prevention, there's a gap in understanding the mechanism, which is the motivation for their new study. So, the general intent here is motivational.

Next, I need to map this to the specific rhetorical classes. The options under Motivational are Motivation and Future. Since the citation is used to identify a knowledge gap and explain why this new research is necessary, it falls under Motivation.

I should make sure I'm not confusing it with other classes. It's not a comparison (so not CoCoGM, CoCoRes, etc.), nor is it supporting their current findings or pointing out weaknesses. It's purely about justifying the need for the current study based on previous work. So, the correct label is Motivation.

The citation is used to justify the current research by identifying a knowledge gap, which fits the Motivation class.

Motivation
