Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me go through the process step by step.

First, I need to extract the context discussing the citation. The passage mentions that the study by @@CITATION@@ found that a small aphid gut binding peptide interferes with virus uptake and binds to other aphid species, suggesting broader applicability. 

Next, I'll identify the general intent. The citing paper is using this citation to suggest future research directions. They mention the peptide's potential applicability, which implies that it could be a lead for further studies.

Now, looking at the specific rhetorical classes, "Future" is the one that fits here. The citation is used to hint at where research could go next, not to compare, support, or motivate the current study directly.

The citation is used to suggest future research directions based on the findings of the cited work.

Future
