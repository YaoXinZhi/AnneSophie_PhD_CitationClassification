Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific article passage. Let me start by understanding the context provided.

The passage is about the hard calcite scale on surfaces exposed to hard water and how magnetic fields can prevent it. The authors mention their previous research, @@CITATION@@, which showed that magnetic treatment can prevent scale formation. However, they also note that the explanation for this phenomenon isn't yet provided, and their current work aims to understand the mechanism behind it.

Now, I'll go through the steps. First, I need to extract the context around @@CITATION@@. The context is that the previous research showed the effectiveness of magnetic treatment but didn't explain why it works. The current study is trying to address this gap.

Next, I'll identify the general intent. The citation is referring to their own previous work to justify why they're conducting the current research. They're pointing out that while the treatment works, the mechanism isn't understood, which is a knowledge gap. This seems like a motivation for their current study.

Looking at the predefined classes, the Motivation category fits here because the citation is used to identify a knowledge gap that the current research aims to fill. The authors are justifying their work by referencing their previous findings and the existing gap in understanding.

I don't think it's Basis because they're not laying the foundation of their research but rather pointing out a gap. It's not a comparison (CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY) since they're not comparing methods or results with another study. It's also not Support or Similar because they're not confirming results but rather explaining why they're doing the study. Usage isn't applicable here because they're not using a method from the cited work. Weakness isn't the case either since they're not criticizing their previous work, just noting an unexplored aspect. Neutral doesn't fit because they're using the citation to motivate their current research.

So, the most appropriate label is Motivation.

The citation is used to identify a knowledge gap in the previous research, motivating the current study's purpose.
