Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific article passage into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. The passage is about plant health, specifically discussing the impact of certain treatments on plant growth and yield.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the citation discusses the use of magnetic treatment on plants, noting that it led to a significant increase in growth and yield without any negative effects. The authors of the current paper state that their findings are consistent with this previous work.

Next, I need to determine the general intent of the citation. Since the current paper's results align with the cited work, it seems the authors are using the citation to support their own findings. This suggests a supportive intent.

Looking at the predefined classes, "Support" is the most appropriate here. The authors are confirming their results by referencing the cited study, which shows a similar positive outcome. They aren't comparing methods or results, nor are they pointing out weaknesses or future directions. It's a straightforward support for their findings.

So, the rhetorical class should be "Support."

The citation is used to support the current study's findings by referencing a previous work that showed similar positive results. Therefore, the rhetorical class is:

Support
