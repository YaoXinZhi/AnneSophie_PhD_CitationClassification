Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let's start by looking at the context provided.

The passage says: "This approach was validated in a series of controlled experiments @@CITATION@@, and the results were compared with those obtained using conventional methods @@CITATION@@."

Hmm, the citation here is mentioned in the context of comparing results. The experiments' results are being compared with conventional methods. So the citation is used to contrast or compare findings between two studies.

Looking at the definitions, CoCoRes is when the citation is used to compare results or findings. That fits because the passage is comparing the results of the cited work with another method. So the general intent is Comparative, specifically CoCoRes.
