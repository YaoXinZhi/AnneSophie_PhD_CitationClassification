Alright, let's try to figure out the rhetorical class for the given citation. First, I need to understand the context in which the citation is used. The passage mentions that the cited work has reported conflicting results regarding the multiplication rates of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains in different parts of infected daisy plants. The authors are pointing out that while some studies show high rates in young leaves and roots, others describe conflicting findings for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima.

So, the context is about comparing two different studies. The first study (Wei et al., 2004) found high rates in young leaves and roots, while the second (Saracco et al., 2006) found conflicting results in another plant. The citation here is used to compare these two studies, highlighting that their findings are in contrast with each other.

Looking at the definitions, CoCoXY refers to comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies, not necessarily with the citing paper. In this case, the authors are comparing the results of two different studies to show conflicting findings. They aren't comparing their own work to either study but are instead discussing the discrepancy between the two cited works.

Therefore, the rhetorical class here is CoCoXY because it's a comparison of the explanations or claims between two cited studies.
