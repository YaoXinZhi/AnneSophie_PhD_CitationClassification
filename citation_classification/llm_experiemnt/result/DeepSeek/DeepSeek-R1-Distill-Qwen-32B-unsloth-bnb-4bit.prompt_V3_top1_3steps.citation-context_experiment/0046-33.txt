Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by carefully reading the passage and understanding the context.

The passage is about the development of a novel biocontrol agent, a bacterium called X, which produces a compound Y that inhibits the growth of a plant pathogenic fungus, Z. The authors mention that this is the first report of such a compound and that they are in the process of isolating and characterizing Y. They then cite a source that has identified a structurally similar compound in another bacterium, S, and note that this supports their hypothesis about the mechanism of action of Y.

Now, I need to break this down step by step. 

Step 1: Extract the context discussing the citation @@CITATION@@. The relevant part is: "this is the first report of such a compound [...] We are currently isolating and characterizing Y. @@CITATION@@ has identified a structurally similar compound [...] which supports our hypothesis [...]"

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation is pointing out a similarity between their work and the cited study. They mention that the cited work identified a similar compound, which supports their hypothesis. This suggests that the citation is used to show a similarity in findings.

Step 3: Select the specific rhetorical class. Looking at the definitions:

- Similar: the citation points out a similarity in results or findings between the cited work and the current paper. In this case, the structurally similar compound supports their hypothesis, indicating a similarity in the compounds' mechanisms.

So, the appropriate label here is "Similar".

The citation is used to highlight a similarity in findings, supporting the current hypothesis.

**Similar**
