Okay, I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let's start by understanding the context. The passage mentions that the citation refers to a study where the taxonomic status of some species is problematic, and some may not develop on Pyrus. The author is pointing out that there's an issue with the classification or identification of these species. 

Looking at the definitions, the rhetorical classes include things like Basis, Support, Weakness, etc. Since the author is highlighting a problem with the cited work, it seems like they're pointing out a limitation or flaw in that study. That would fit under the 'Weakness' category because they're criticizing or questioning the cited work's findings. 

I don't think it's 'CoCoGM' or 'CoCoRes' because they're not comparing their own methods or results with the cited work. It's more about pointing out a specific issue in the cited paper. Also, it's not 'Motivation' because they're not justifying why they're doing their research. They're directly addressing a problem in the cited study. 

So, the most appropriate label here is 'Weakness' because the author is pointing out a limitation in the cited work.
