Alright, I need to determine the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific article passage. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the citation reports conflicting results about the multiplication rates of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains in different plant parts. It also notes that conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima.

Next, I'll identify the general intent. The citation is comparing two studies that have conflicting results, not necessarily contrasting with the current paper's findings. It's pointing out that different studies have different outcomes regarding phytoplasma multiplication.

Now, mapping this to the predefined classes. The example given for CoCoXY involves comparing two cited studies with each other, not with the citing paper. Since the passage is discussing conflicting results between two cited works, this fits the CoCoXY category.
