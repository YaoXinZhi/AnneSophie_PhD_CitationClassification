Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific article passage. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@."

So, the context is comparing the current study's results with those from a previous study. The key point here is that the current results are different from the cited work's results.

Next, I need to identify the general intent. Since the passage is comparing results, the intent is Comparative. Looking at the options, Comparative falls under CoCoGM, CoCoRes, or CoCoXY.

Now, to select the specific rhetorical class. The example given for CoCoRes is when the citation is used to directly compare or contrast results. In this case, the current work's results are being contrasted with the cited experiments. So, it's a direct comparison of results, not methods or explanations.

Therefore, the appropriate label should be CoCoRes.
