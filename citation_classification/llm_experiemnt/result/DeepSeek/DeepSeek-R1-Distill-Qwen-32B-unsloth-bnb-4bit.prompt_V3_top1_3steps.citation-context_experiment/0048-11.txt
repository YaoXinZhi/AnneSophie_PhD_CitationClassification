Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the context provided is: "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@." 

Step 1: Extract the context discussing the citation. The sentence is straightforwardâ€”it mentions that the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 in the USA, citing a source. The citation here is providing a factual statement without any additional commentary or analysis.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation is simply stating a fact about the spread of magnetic water treatment devices. It's not comparing anything, supporting a claim, or motivating further research. It's just providing a neutral piece of information.

Step 3: Select the specific rhetorical class. Looking at the definitions, "Neutral" is used when the citation is descriptive without supporting, comparing, criticizing, or motivating. Since the citation is just stating a fact without any further argument or analysis, "Neutral" seems to be the appropriate label here.
