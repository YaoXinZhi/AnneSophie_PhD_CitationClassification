Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by reading the passage carefully.

The passage says: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." So, the authors are referring to a previous work where the experimental setup was detailed. 

Now, I need to extract the context. The context here is that the current study is using an experimental setup that was already described in another paper. They're not comparing their results or methods, nor are they supporting or criticizing the previous work. They're simply stating that they used a setup that was previously documented.

Next, I have to identify the general intent. The citation is referring to a method or setup used in the current study. The authors are pointing out that they used a method described elsewhere, which falls under the usage category. They're not using it to compare, support, or motivate their own work; they're just referencing where they got their method from.

Looking at the predefined classes, "Usage" is the one that fits here because the citation refers to a method or experimental setup used in the current study. The authors are not comparing, supporting, or critiquing the cited work, but merely using it as a reference for their setup.

So, the most appropriate label is "Usage."
