Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to classify a citation in a scientific article passage into a specific rhetorical class. I'm given a passage with a citation marked as @@CITATION@@, and I need to determine which rhetorical class it belongs to based on the context and the predefined list of classes.

First, I'll start by extracting the context around the citation. The passage provided is about the effect of magnetic treatment on water scale formation. The sentence mentions that previous research has shown the prevention of hard calcite scale using a magnetic field, but the explanation of the phenomena isn't yet offered. The current work aims to understand the mechanism.

Next, I need to identify the general intent of the citation. The citation is referring to previous research that demonstrated the effectiveness of magnetic fields in preventing scale formation. The current study is building upon this by trying to explain the mechanism behind it. This seems to be using the citation to justify why this research is being conducted, pointing out a knowledge gapâ€”the lack of an explanation.

Looking at the predefined classes, "Motivation" fits here because the citation is used to identify a knowledge gap, which justifies the current research. The other classes don't seem to apply: it's not a comparison, support, or usage of a method, nor is it pointing out a weakness or similarity. It's clearly setting up the rationale for the current study.

So, the most appropriate rhetorical class for this citation is "Motivation."
