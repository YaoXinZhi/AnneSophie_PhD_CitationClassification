Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by understanding the task. I have to extract the context around the citation, identify the general intent, and then assign a specific label from the predefined list.

First, I'll look at the passage provided. It says, "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@." The citation here is talking about the spread of magnetic water treatment devices in the USA since 1975. 

Now, I need to extract the context. The sentence is descriptive, stating a fact about the spread of these devices. There's no indication of comparison, support, motivation, or any other specific intent beyond just stating this information.

Next, identifying the general intent. The sentence isn't using the citation to compare methods or results, nor is it supporting or criticizing anything. It's simply providing background information. So, the intent seems neutral.

Looking at the predefined classes, the most appropriate one here is "Neutral." The citation is used descriptively without any supporting, comparing, or critical tone. It's just stating a fact about the spread of magnetic devices, so "Neutral" fits best.
