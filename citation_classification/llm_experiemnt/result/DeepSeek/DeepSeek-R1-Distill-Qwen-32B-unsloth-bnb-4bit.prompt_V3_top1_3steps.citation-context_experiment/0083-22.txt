Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me go through the steps as outlined.

First, I'll extract the context discussing the citation. The passage says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@."

Looking at this, the context is about comparing the results of the current study with those of the cited work. The key phrase here is "substantially differ from the results," which indicates a comparison of findings.

Next, I need to identify the general intent. Since the citation is used to compare results, the general intent is Comparative. Now, looking at the specific rhetorical classes under Comparative, we have CoCoGM, CoCoRes, and CoCoXY.

CoCoRes specifically refers to comparing results or findings directly. The example given is similar to our context: comparing results of experiments. So, the citation is used to contrast the current results with those from the cited paper.

Therefore, the most appropriate label here is CoCoRes.

CoCoRes
