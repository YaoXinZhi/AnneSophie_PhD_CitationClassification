Alright, I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. The passage mentions that the citation is from a study where researchers found conflicting results about a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima. 

First, I need to understand the context. The passage is comparing two studies: one where fast multiplication rates were reported in certain plants and another where conflicting results were found in a different plant. The citation is used to highlight this discrepancy between the two studies.

Looking at the definitions, the relevant classes are Comparative. Specifically, CoCoXY is when the citation compares or contrasts two studies with each other, not with the citing paper. Here, the citation is showing conflicting results between two studies, which fits CoCoXY.

Other classes like CoCoRes involve comparing results with the citing paper, but here it's comparing two cited works. So, the correct class is CoCoXY.

The citation is used to compare two studies with conflicting results, fitting the CoCoXY class.

CoCoXY
