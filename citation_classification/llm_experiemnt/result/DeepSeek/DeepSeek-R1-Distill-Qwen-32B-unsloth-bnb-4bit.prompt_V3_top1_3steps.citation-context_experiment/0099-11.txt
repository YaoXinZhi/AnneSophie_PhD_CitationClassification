Okay, so I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific article passage into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. Let me go through the process step by step.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the study found phytoplasma in daisy plants, and the citation is used to note conflicting results with another study. The key part is "although conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima @@CITATION@@."

Next, I need to determine the general intent. The context is comparing two studies where one reports high concentrations and the other describes conflicting results. This suggests a comparison between two cited works, not directly with the current paper.

Looking at the rhetorical classes, CoCoXY is about comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies. Since the citation is used to highlight a conflict between two studies, it fits into CoCoXY.

So, the most appropriate label is CoCoXY.
