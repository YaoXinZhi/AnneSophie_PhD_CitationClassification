Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me go through the steps carefully.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage is: "The taxonomic status of these species is problematic and some may not develop on Pyrus @@CITATION@@." 

Looking at this, the sentence is pointing out that the taxonomic status is problematic and some species might not develop on Pyrus. The citation is attached to this statement. 

Now, I need to determine the general intent of the citation. The sentence is critical of the cited work because it's pointing out that the taxonomic status is problematic and questioning whether some species develop on Pyrus. This seems like a criticism or pointing out a limitation in the cited study.

Next, I'll look at the predefined rhetorical classes. The one that fits here is "Weakness," which is used when the citation is pointing out limitations or flaws in the cited work. 

So, the rhetorical class should be "Weakness."
