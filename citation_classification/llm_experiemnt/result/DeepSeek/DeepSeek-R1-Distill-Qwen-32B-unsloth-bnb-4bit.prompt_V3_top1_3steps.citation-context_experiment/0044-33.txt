Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by understanding the task. I have to extract the context, identify the general intent, and then assign the most appropriate label from the predefined list.

First, I'll look at the passage provided. It says, "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@@."

So, the context here is about a study's findings. The authors are discussing their finding that insect hosts influence bacterial community assembly. They mention that this finding is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations, specifically citing another study. The citation is used to back up their own results, showing that their conclusion aligns with other research.

Looking at the general intent, this seems to be a supportive use. The citation is used to confirm their findings, showing that their work is consistent with other studies. So, the general intent is Supportive.

Now, mapping this to the specific rhetorical classes, the Support class is when the citation supports, confirms, or corroborates the citing authors' work. The example given for Support is similar: a finding supported by previous research. In this case, the authors are explicitly stating that their finding is supported by the cited work, which fits the Support category.

I don't think it's any of the other classes. It's not a comparison of methods or results with their own (so not CoCoGM or CoCoRes), nor is it a comparison between two other studies (so not CoCoXY). It's not foundational, motivational, future, similar, usage, weakness, or neutral. It's directly supporting their own findings with another study.
