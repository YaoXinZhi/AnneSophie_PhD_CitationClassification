Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in the given passage. Let me start by reading the passage carefully. 

The passage says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@."

Alright, so the key part here is that the results of the current study are being compared to the results of a previous study cited. The word "substantially differ" indicates a contrast between the two sets of results. 

Looking at the definitions, the rhetorical class CoCoRes is used when the citation is comparing or contrasting results or findings between the current paper and the cited work. In this case, the current work's results are being directly contrasted with those of the cited study. 

I don't think it's any of the other classes because it's not about motivation, support, or usage. It's specifically about comparing results, so CoCoRes fits best here.
