Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me start by understanding the task. I need to assign a rhetorical class to the citation based on how it's used in the passage. The classes are things like Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, etc. 

First, I'll look at the context provided. The user hasn't given a specific passage, so I'll have to imagine a typical scenario. Let's say the passage is something like: "Previous studies have shown that plant diseases can be controlled using biological methods @@CITATION@@. This approach is gaining popularity due to its eco-friendly nature." 

Step 1 is to extract the context. The relevant part here is that the citation is supporting the statement about the popularity and effectiveness of biological methods. 

Step 2 is to identify the general intent. The citation is being used to back up the claim, so it's supportive. 

Looking at the classes, Support is the one where the citation confirms or supports the citing authors' work. So, the intent is Support. 

Is there any other class that might fit? Maybe Similar if it's pointing out a similarity, but here it's more about confirming the effectiveness. So, Support seems right. 

I don't think it's Basis because it's not laying the foundation but rather supporting a point. It's not a comparison, so CoCo classes don't apply. It's not Motivation or Future either. 

So, the final label should be Support.
