Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by understanding the context.

The passage says, "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." Hmm, the key here is that the authors are referring to a previous description of their experimental setup. They're using the citation to point to where the details were already laid out. 

Looking at the predefined classes, "Usage" seems to fit here because it's about using a method or setup from a previous study. The authors aren't comparing their results or methods, nor are they supporting or criticizing the cited work. They're simply directing readers to where the method was previously detailed. 

So, the citation is used to reference a method or setup, which aligns with the "Usage" class.

The citation refers to a previous detailed description of the experimental setup, indicating the use of a method from a prior work.
