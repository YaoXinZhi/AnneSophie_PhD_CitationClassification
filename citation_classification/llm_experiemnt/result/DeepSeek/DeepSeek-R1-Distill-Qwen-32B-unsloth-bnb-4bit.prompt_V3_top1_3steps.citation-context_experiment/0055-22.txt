Alright, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in this passage. Let me go through the steps.

First, I'll look at the context given. The passage is about a study on the effect of magnetic treatment on scale formation in hard water. They mention that their previous research showed the prevention of scale formation but didn't explain the mechanism. Now, they're conducting this new study to understand the mechanism.

The citation @@CITATION@@ is referencing their own previous work. The intent here is to establish why they're doing this current research. They're pointing out that while they've seen the effect, the mechanism isn't understood, hence the motivation for the new study.

Looking at the rhetorical classes, Motivation fits because they're justifying the current research by identifying a knowledge gap. They're not comparing, supporting, or criticizing; they're explaining the reason behind their work.

So, the label should be Motivation.

The citation is used to justify the current research by identifying a knowledge gap, thus the rhetorical class is:

**Motivation**
