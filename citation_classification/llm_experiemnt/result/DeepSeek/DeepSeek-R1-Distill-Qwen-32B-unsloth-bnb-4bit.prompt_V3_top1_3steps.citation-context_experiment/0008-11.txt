Alright, let's try to figure out how to classify this citation. The user provided a passage where the citation is tagged as @@CITATION@@. The task is to assign a rhetorical class to this citation based on the context and predefined categories.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage says: "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@@."

Looking at this, the authors are discussing their findings about insect hosts affecting bacterial communities. They mention that their results are supported by other studies on insect-associated bacteria, specifically citing another study that found arthropod hosts influence bacterial assemblages in fleas and ticks, while other factors didn't.

Now, the general intent here seems to be supporting their own findings. They're pointing out that their results align with previous research, which adds credibility to their work.

Next, looking at the predefined categories, "Support" is when the citation is used to confirm or back up the current paper's results. The example given for Support is similar: a finding supported by previous research.

So, the citation is being used to support the authors' findings, showing that their results are consistent with other studies. Therefore, the appropriate rhetorical class is "Support."
