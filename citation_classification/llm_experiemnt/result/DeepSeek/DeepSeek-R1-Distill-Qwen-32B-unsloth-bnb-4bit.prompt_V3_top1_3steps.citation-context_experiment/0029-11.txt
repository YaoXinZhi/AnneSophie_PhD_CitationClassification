Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific article passage. Let me start by understanding the context. The passage says, "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." 

Step 1: Extract the context. The context here is that the current study is referring to a previous detailed description of their experimental setup. 

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation is pointing to a method or setup used in the current study. It's about how they conducted their experiments, referencing a prior work that detailed this setup.

Step 3: Select the specific rhetorical class. Looking at the definitions, "Usage" refers to citing a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup used in the current study. Since the passage is directly mentioning that the setup was described in a previous work, it falls under Usage.

So, the label should be Usage.
