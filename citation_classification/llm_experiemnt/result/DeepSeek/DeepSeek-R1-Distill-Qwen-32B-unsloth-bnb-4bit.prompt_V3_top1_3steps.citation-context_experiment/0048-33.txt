Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let's start by understanding the task.

The context provided is a passage from a scientific article. The citation is tagged as @@CITATION@@, and I need to extract the context around it, identify the general intent, and then assign the most appropriate rhetorical class from the predefined list.

First, I'll look at the context. The passage mentions that the citation refers to a study showing the multiplication rates and high concentration of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains in infected daisy plants. However, it also notes conflicting results from another study on a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima.

So, the context is about two studies: one reports high concentrations, and another reports conflicting results. The citation is used to highlight that there's a discrepancy between these two studies. The authors are pointing out that while one study found high concentrations, another found conflicting results, which suggests a comparison between the two cited works.

Looking at the rhetorical classes, the options are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Motivation, Future, Support, Similar, Usage, Weakness, Neutral.

In this case, the citation is comparing two studies with each other, not with the citing paper. The example given for CoCoXY is exactly this scenario: when two cited studies are compared with each other. The passage uses the citation to show conflicting results between two studies, which fits under CoCoXY.

So, the general intent is a comparison of explanations or claims between two cited studies. Therefore, the rhetorical class should be CoCoXY.
