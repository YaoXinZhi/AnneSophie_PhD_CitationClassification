Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by understanding the context and the task.

First, the passage is about the use of magnetic fields to prevent hard water scaling. It mentions that previous research showed this prevention but didn't explain the mechanism, so the current work aims to understand it.

Step 1: Extract the context. The relevant part is that the citation refers to previous research which showed the prevention but didn't explain the mechanism. The current study is motivated by this gap.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. This seems to be about justifying why the current research is being conducted, pointing out a knowledge gap. So, the general intent is Motivational.

Step 3: Select the specific rhetorical class. From the options, Motivation is the one that fits because it's justifying the research by identifying an open question or knowledge gap.

So, the rhetorical class should be Motivation.
