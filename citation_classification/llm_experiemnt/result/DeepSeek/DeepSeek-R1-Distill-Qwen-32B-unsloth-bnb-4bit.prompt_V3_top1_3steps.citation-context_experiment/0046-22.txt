Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let's start by understanding the context. The passage says that the authors found a specific phenomenon in their study, and then they reference a citation that describes a similar phenomenon in another plant species. 

First, I'll extract the context. The key part is that the citation is pointing out a similarity between their findings and another study. The authors are saying that their results are similar to what was found in a different plant species, using the citation as evidence of this similarity.

Next, I need to determine the general intent. Since they're highlighting that their results are similar to another study, this seems to be a supportive or comparative intent. The citation isn't being used to criticize or motivate; instead, it's showing that their findings align with existing research.

Looking at the predefined classes, the options that fit are "Support" or "Similar." "Support" is when the citation confirms the authors' work, while "Similar" points out a similarity in results or observations. In this case, the authors explicitly mention that their finding is supported by another study, which indicates a similarity in results across different plant species.

Therefore, the most appropriate rhetorical class here is "Similar" because the citation is used to show that the current findings align with those of another study, emphasizing the consistency across different contexts.

The citation @@CITATION@@ is used to highlight a similarity in findings between the current study and another, indicating that the phenomenon observed is consistent across different plant species.

**Step-by-step Explanation:**

1. **Context Extraction:** The citation is used to show that a phenomenon observed in the current study is similar to findings in another plant species, as described in the cited work.

2. **General Intent:** The intent is to demonstrate a similarity in results between studies, supporting the current findings by showing they are consistent with existing research.

3. **Rhetorical Class Selection:** The appropriate class is "Similar" because the citation points out a similarity in results between the current study and another, not just supporting the current work but specifically noting the alignment of findings across different contexts.

**Answer:** Similar
