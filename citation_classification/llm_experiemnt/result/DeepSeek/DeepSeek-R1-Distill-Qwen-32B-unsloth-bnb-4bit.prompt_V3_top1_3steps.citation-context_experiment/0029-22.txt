Alright, I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the context is about the impact of magnetic treatment on the formation of hard calcite scales. The sentence mentions that their previous research showed that magnetic fields prevent scale formation, but the mechanism isn't explained yet, so they're conducting this new study.

Now, looking at the citation, it's cited in the motivation part. They're using it to explain why they're doing this current research because the previous work didn't address the mechanism. So the intent is to justify the current study by pointing out a knowledge gap.

From the definitions, Motivation is when the citation is used to justify why the research is being conducted, like identifying a gap or an open question. The example given is similar: citing previous research that showed a phenomenon but didn't explain it, thus motivating the current study.

So, the rhetorical class here is Motivation.
