Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me go through the steps one by one.

First, I'll extract the context discussing the citation. The passage says, "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@@."

So the context is about supporting a finding with another study. The authors mention their own finding and then reference another study that supports it.

Next, I need to identify the general intent. Since the citation is used to back up their own results, the intent is supportive. Looking at the options, Support and Similar are possible. Support is when the citation confirms the work, while Similar points out a similarity. Here, it's more about confirmation rather than just similarity.

So the specific rhetorical class is Support. The example given for Support is similar, where a previous study's findings are used to back up the current results.

The citation is used to support the current findings by referencing a previous study. 

**Support**
