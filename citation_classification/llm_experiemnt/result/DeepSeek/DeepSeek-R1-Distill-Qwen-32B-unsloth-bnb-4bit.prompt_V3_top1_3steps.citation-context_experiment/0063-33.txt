Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me go through the steps.

First, I'll extract the context. The passage says that the citation is about 18 species described from China, collected on cultivated and wild pear. It also mentions that the taxonomic status is problematic, and some may not develop on Pyrus.

Next, I need to identify the general intent. The sentence points out that the taxonomic status is problematic and some species might not develop on Pyrus. This seems like the author is criticizing or pointing out limitations in the cited work.

Looking at the predefined classes, the one that fits is "Weakness," which is used when the citation is criticizing or pointing out flaws in the cited work. The example given for Weakness is similar, where the taxonomic status is problematic.

So, putting it all together, the rhetorical class here is Weakness.

Weakness
