Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me go through the steps carefully.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage says: "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@@."

Looking at this, the main point is that the authors are supporting their own findings by referencing another study. They mention that their results are consistent with recent investigations, specifically pointing out that in fleas and ticks, the host governs bacterial assemblages, unlike rodent hosts or environmental factors.

Next, I need to identify the general intent. The authors are using the citation to back up their own results. They're saying that their finding is supported by other research, which fits into the 'Supportive' category.

Now, looking at the specific rhetorical classes under 'Supportive', there's 'Support' and 'Similar'. 'Support' is when the citation directly confirms the work or findings of the current paper. 'Similar' is when the cited work shows a similarity in results or patterns.

In this case, the authors are explicitly stating that their finding is "supported by" other investigations. They're using the citation to confirm their results, so it's more about support rather than just noting a similarity.

Therefore, the rhetorical class here is 'Support'.

The citation is used to support the authors' findings by referencing another study that confirms their results.
