Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by understanding the context and the steps I need to follow.

First, the task is to classify the citation into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. The passage provided is about plant health, specifically mentioning the usage of magnetic fields to prevent calcite scale formation. The sentence in question is: "Our previous research @@CITATION@@ has shown that the formation of the hard calcite scale on the surfaces exposed to hard water can be successfully prevented with the applied magnetic field. The explanation of the phenomena is not yet offered and the purpose of this work is to try to understand the mechanism of the beneficial influence of the magnetic treatment."

So, the citation here is referencing the authors' own previous work. The context is that their previous study demonstrated that magnetic fields can prevent calcite scale formation, but the mechanism behind it hasn't been explained yet. The current work aims to address this gap.

Looking at the steps, I need to extract the context, identify the general intent, and then assign the specific rhetorical class.

Step 1: Extract the context. The passage mentions that the previous research showed the effectiveness of magnetic fields in preventing scale formation. However, the mechanism isn't understood, which is the motivation for the current study.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation is used to explain why the current research is being conductedâ€”because there's a knowledge gap in understanding the mechanism. So the general intent is Motivational.

Step 3: Assign the specific rhetorical class. The options under Motivational are Motivation and Future. The citation here is justifying why the current research is necessary, pointing out a knowledge gap. So it's Motivation, not Future, because Future would imply suggesting directions for future research, which isn't the case here.

Wait, but let me double-check. The example for Motivation is when the citation is used to identify a knowledge gap. Here, the previous research showed an effect without explaining it, so the current work is motivated by this gap. That fits Motivation.

Alternatively, could it be Support? No, because Support is when the citation confirms the current work's findings, which isn't the case here. The current work is building on the previous result to explain it, not supporting it.

So, the correct class should be Motivation.

The citation is used to identify a knowledge gap in understanding the mechanism behind the effect observed in previous research, motivating the current study. 

**Motivation**
