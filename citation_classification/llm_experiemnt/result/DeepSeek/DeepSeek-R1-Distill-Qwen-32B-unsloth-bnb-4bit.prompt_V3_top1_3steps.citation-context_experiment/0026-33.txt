Okay, I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I'll look at the context provided. The passage mentions that the citation is discussing the multiplication rates and conflicting results regarding a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima. It's comparing reports from Wei et al. (2004) and Saracco et al. (2006) with the cited work.

Step 1 is to extract the context. The key part is that conflicting results are described for a phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima, referencing the citation. So the context is about comparing two studies' findings.

Step 2 is to identify the general intent. The citation is used to compare conflicting results from two studies. That falls under a comparative intent, specifically comparing explanations or claims between two cited works.

Step 3 is to select the specific rhetorical class. Looking at the definitions, CoCoXY is used when comparing two cited studies with each other, not with the citing paper. The example given in CoCoXY is exactly this scenario: conflicting results between two studies. 

So the most appropriate label is CoCoXY.
