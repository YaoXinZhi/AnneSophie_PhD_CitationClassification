Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in the given passage. Let me start by understanding the context and the task.

The passage provided is about a study on plant health, specifically looking at how the presence of certain bacteria affects the growth of wheat roots. The authors mention that they used a method described in another study by Smith et al. (2020) to analyze the root length. 

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The key part is that the method from Smith et al. was used for measuring root length. This indicates that the current study is applying a specific technique or approach that was previously established.

Next, I need to determine the general intent of the citation. Since the authors are referring to a method they used, this seems to fall under the "Usage" category. They're not comparing their results, supporting their findings, or motivating their research based on this citation. Instead, they're directly using a tool or method from another study.

Looking at the predefined classes, "Usage" refers to when a citation is used for a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup. In this case, the citation is about a method used in the current study, so it fits perfectly.

I don't think it's any of the other classes like Support or Basis because they're not using it to back up their results or establish foundational theory. It's purely about the method they adopted.

So, the rhetorical class here should be "Usage."
