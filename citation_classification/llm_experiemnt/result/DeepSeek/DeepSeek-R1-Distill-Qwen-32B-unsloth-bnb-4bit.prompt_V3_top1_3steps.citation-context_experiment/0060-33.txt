Okay, I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me start by extracting the context.

The context provided is: "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@@."

So, the passage is talking about their findings regarding insect hosts affecting bacterial community assembly. They mention that this finding is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations, specifically citing another study where arthropod hosts governed bacterial assemblages in fleas and ticks, while rodent hosts and environmental conditions didn't.

Now, looking at the general intent. The citation is used to back up their own findings. They're saying their result is consistent with another study, which means they're supporting their work with prior research.

Looking at the predefined classes, the one that fits here is 'Support'. The example given for Support is when the citation is used to confirm the work of the citing authors, which is exactly what's happening here. They're using the cited work to support their own findings.

I don't think it's 'Similar' because 'Similar' is about pointing out a similarity between the cited and current work, but here they're directly supporting their findings with another study. It's more about confirmation than just similarity.

So, the most appropriate label is 'Support'.
