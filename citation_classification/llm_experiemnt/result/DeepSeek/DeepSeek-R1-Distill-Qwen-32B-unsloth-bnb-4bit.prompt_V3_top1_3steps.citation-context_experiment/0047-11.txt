Alright, I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage says, "The taxonomic status of these species is problematic and some may not develop on Pyrus @@CITATION@@." So, the context is about the taxonomic issues of certain species, specifically that their status is problematic and some might not develop on Pyrus.

Next, I should identify the general intent. The sentence is pointing out a problem or limitation in the cited work. It's not comparing methods, supporting the current work, or introducing a foundational concept. Instead, it's criticizing the cited study by stating that their taxonomic findings are problematic.

Looking at the predefined classes, the one that fits here is "Weakness" because the citation is used to point out limitations or flaws in the cited work. The example given for Weakness is similar: "The taxonomic status of these species is problematic and some may not develop on Pyrus @@CITATION@@." This directly aligns with the passage provided.

So, the rhetorical class should be Weakness.

Weakness
