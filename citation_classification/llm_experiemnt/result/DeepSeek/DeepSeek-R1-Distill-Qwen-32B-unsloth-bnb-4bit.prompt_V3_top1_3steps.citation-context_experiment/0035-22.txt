Alright, I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage says: "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@@." 

So, the authors are talking about their finding related to insect hosts affecting bacterial communities. They mention that their results are supported by recent cross-taxon investigations, specifically citing another study.

Next, I'll identify the general intent of the citation. The authors are using the cited work to back up their own findings. They're saying that their results are consistent with what others have found in similar contexts. This suggests that the intent is supportive.

Now, looking at the predefined classes, the most appropriate one here is "Support." The citation is used to confirm or corroborate the current study's results. The example given for Support is similar, where a previous study's findings align with the current research.

I don't think it's any of the other classes. It's not a comparison of methods or results (CoCoGM or CoCoRes), nor is it introducing a foundational concept (Basis). It's not pointing out a weakness or suggesting future work either. It's clearly supporting the current findings with prior research.
