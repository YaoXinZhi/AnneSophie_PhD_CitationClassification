Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in the given context. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I'll look at the context provided. The passage is about the use of magnetic water treatment devices in the USA, starting from 1975, and the citation is mentioned right after that statement. The sentence is: "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@."

Step 1: Extract the context. The context here is about the spread of magnetic water treatment devices in the USA since 1975. The citation is used to back up this fact.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation is providing a source for the information about the spread of these devices. It's not comparing anything, nor is it motivating or suggesting future work. It's simply stating a fact and citing where this information comes from.

Step 3: Select the specific rhetorical class. Looking at the definitions, "Neutral" is when the citation is used in a descriptive way without supporting, comparing, etc. The citation here is just providing a reference for a factual statement, so it's neutral.
