Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by understanding the context.

The passage is about a study where the authors observed that the application of magnetic fields to hard water prevents the formation of hard calcite scales. They mention that this observation was made in their previous work, which is cited here. The current study aims to understand the mechanism behind this beneficial effect.

Step 1: Extract the context. The relevant part is that the previous research showed the prevention of scale formation, and now the authors are trying to explain why it happens. So the citation is referring to their earlier study that established the phenomenon they're now investigating.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation is used to justify why this current research is being done. They're pointing out that while the effect was observed before, the mechanism isn't understood, hence the motivation for the current study.

Step 3: Assign the specific rhetorical class. Since the citation is used to identify a knowledge gap and justify the current research, it falls under the "Motivation" category.
