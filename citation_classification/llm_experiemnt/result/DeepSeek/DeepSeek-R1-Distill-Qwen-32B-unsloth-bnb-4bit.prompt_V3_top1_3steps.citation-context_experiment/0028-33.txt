Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to assign a rhetorical class to the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific article passage. The passage is about plant health, specifically focusing on how certain treatments affect plant diseases.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The sentence is: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." This seems straightforward. The authors are referencing a previous work where they detailed their experimental setup.

Next, I need to identify the general intent of this citation. The sentence is indicating that the method or setup used in the current study was previously described. This doesn't seem to be about comparing results, motivating the study, or supporting a claim. Instead, it's pointing to a resource or tool that was used in their research.

Looking at the predefined rhetorical classes, the one that stands out here is "Usage." This category refers to when a citation is used to reference a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup that's directly used in the current study. In this case, the authors are clearly referring to their previous work for the setup they used, which fits perfectly under "Usage."

I don't think it's any other category like "Support" because they're not using the citation to back up a result or finding. It's more about the method itself. "CoCoGM" or "CoCoRes" would involve comparing methods or results, which isn't the case here. Similarly, "Basis" would imply foundational research, but the citation is more about the setup than the theoretical underpinning.

So, after considering all the options, "Usage" is the most appropriate rhetorical class for this citation.
