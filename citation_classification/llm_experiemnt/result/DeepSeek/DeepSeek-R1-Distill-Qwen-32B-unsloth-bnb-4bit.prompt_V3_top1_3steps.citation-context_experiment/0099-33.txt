Alright, I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me go through the steps carefully.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage is about the occurrence of the pathogen Xylella fastidiosa in olive trees. It mentions that the pathogen was first detected in 2013 in Puglia, Italy, and has since spread to other regions. The citation is attached to the statement about the spread to Corsica and France in 2015.

Next, I need to identify the general intent of this citation. The sentence is providing information about the spread of the pathogen, citing a source that reports this occurrence. The purpose here is to support the fact that the pathogen spread beyond Italy, using the cited work as evidence.

Looking at the predefined classes, the most fitting one seems to be "Support." The citation is used to confirm or back up the statement about the spread of Xylella fastidiosa, indicating that the cited work provides evidence for this occurrence.

I don't think it's Comparative since there's no comparison being made. It's not Motivational or Future as it's not justifying the research or suggesting future directions. It's also not a Usage or Weakness case. It's simply supporting the factual information presented.
