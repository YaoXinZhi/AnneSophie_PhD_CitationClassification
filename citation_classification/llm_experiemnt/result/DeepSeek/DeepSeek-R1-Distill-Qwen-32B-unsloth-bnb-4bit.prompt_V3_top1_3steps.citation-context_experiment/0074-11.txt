Okay, I need to determine the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by extracting the context around the citation.

The passage says: "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@."

Step 1: Extracting the context. The sentence is simply stating a fact about the spread of magnetic water treatment devices in the USA since 1975, citing a source.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation is providing a factual statement without any comparison, motivation, support, or criticism. It's just describing a trend.

Step 3: Selecting the rhetorical class. Since the citation is used neutrally to present a fact without supporting, comparing, or critiquing, the appropriate label is Neutral.
