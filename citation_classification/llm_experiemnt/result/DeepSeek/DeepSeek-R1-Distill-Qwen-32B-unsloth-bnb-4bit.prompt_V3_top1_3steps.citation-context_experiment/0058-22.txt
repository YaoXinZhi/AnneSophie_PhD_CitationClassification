Okay, I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the citation refers to studies on the multiplication rates and high concentration of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains in infected daisy plants. It also notes conflicting results for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima.

Now, identifying the general intent. The passage is comparing two studies: one where the results support high multiplication rates and another where there are conflicting results. This seems like a comparison between two cited works, not necessarily with the current paper's findings.

Looking at the specific rhetorical classes, CoCoXY is for comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies. Since the passage is contrasting the findings of Wei et al. and Saracco et al., this fits the CoCoXY category.
