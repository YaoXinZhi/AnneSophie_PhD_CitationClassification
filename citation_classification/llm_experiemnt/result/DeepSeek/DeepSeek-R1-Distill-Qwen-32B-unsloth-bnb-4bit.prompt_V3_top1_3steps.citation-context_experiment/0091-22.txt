Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me go through the steps carefully.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage says: "Previous studies have shown that magnetic treatment can prevent the formation of hard calcite scales in hard water systems @@CITATION@@. This work builds upon those findings to explore the underlying mechanisms."

Alright, so the context is about previous studies that showed magnetic treatment can prevent scale formation, and the current work is building on that. The citation is referring to these studies.

Next, I need to identify the general intent. The current paper is using the citation to justify why they're conducting their research. They're pointing out that previous work has shown a certain effect, and now they want to understand the mechanism behind it. That sounds like it's providing motivation for their study.

Now, looking at the specific rhetorical classes, "Motivation" is when the citation is used to justify the current research, like identifying a knowledge gap or open question. The example given for Motivation is similar: previous research showed something, and the current work is trying to explain why. So this fits the Motivation category.

I don't think it's any of the other classes like Basis because it's not establishing the intellectual foundation but rather justifying the current study's purpose. It's not a comparison or supporting their results, so it's not Support or CoCo. It's not a technical usage of a method either. So the most appropriate label here is Motivation.
