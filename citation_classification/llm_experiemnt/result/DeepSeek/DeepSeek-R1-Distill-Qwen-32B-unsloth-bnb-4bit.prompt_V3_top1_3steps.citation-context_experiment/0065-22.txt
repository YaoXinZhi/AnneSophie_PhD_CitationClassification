Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by reading the passage carefully.

The passage says: "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@." 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The sentence is about the spread of magnetic water treatment devices in the USA since 1975, and the citation is tagging the source of this information.

Next, I should identify the general intent of the citation. The sentence is simply stating a fact about the spread of these devices without any comparative, supportive, or critical language. It's just providing information without any argument or comparison.

Now, looking at the predefined classes, the Neutral class is used when the citation is descriptive without supporting, comparing, criticizing, or motivating any specific argument. Since the passage is just stating a fact without any of those elements, Neutral seems appropriate.

I don't think it's any of the other classes like Basis because it's not establishing a foundation. It's not a comparison (CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY), nor is it motivational, future-oriented, supportive, similar, a usage reference, or pointing out a weakness. It's just a neutral statement citing a source for the information.

So, the most appropriate label here is Neutral.
