Okay, so I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. Let me start by understanding the context and the task.

The passage provided is about a study on the impact of magnetic treatment on water scaling. The authors mention that their previous work showed the effectiveness of magnetic fields in preventing scale formation but noted that the mechanism wasn't understood. They then state that this new work aims to explore that mechanism, citing their previous study.

Looking at the context, the citation is used to explain why they're conducting this new research. It's pointing out that while their previous work showed an effect, the underlying reason wasn't clear, hence the motivation for the current study.

Now, considering the rhetorical classes, the key here is that the citation is justifying the need for the current research by highlighting a knowledge gap. That fits under the "Motivation" category because it's explaining why the study is necessary.

I don't think it's "Basis" because it's not foundational; it's more about the motivation to do this specific study. It's also not a comparison, so CoCo classes don't apply. Similarly, it's not supporting, similar, usage, weakness, or neutral. It's clearly about motivating the current research by pointing out an unresolved issue from their prior work.

The citation is used to justify the current research by highlighting a knowledge gap from previous work.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Context Extraction:** The passage discusses a study on magnetic treatment's effect on water scaling. The authors reference their previous work, which showed effectiveness without understanding the mechanism, motivating their new research.

2. **General Intent:** The citation is used to identify a knowledge gap, justifying the current study.

3. **Rhetorical Class:** This aligns with "Motivation" as it explains why the research is conducted.

**Answer:** Motivation
