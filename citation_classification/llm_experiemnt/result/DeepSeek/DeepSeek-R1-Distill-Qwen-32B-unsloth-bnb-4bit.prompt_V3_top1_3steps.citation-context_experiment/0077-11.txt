Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the context provided is about the movement of a plant pathogen through a plant's phloem. The passage mentions that the pathogen's movement is influenced by various factors, including the plant's age and the pathogen's strain. It also states that this movement is a key factor in the spread of the disease and references a study by @@CITATION@@ that found the pathogen's movement is influenced by the plant's phloem structure.

Now, I need to determine the intent behind citing this study. The passage is explaining the importance of the pathogen's movement and uses the citation to support this explanation. It's not comparing the study's methods or results with another study, nor is it suggesting future research or pointing out a limitation. Instead, it's using the cited work to back up the statement about the influence of phloem structure on pathogen movement.

Looking at the rhetorical classes, Support is when the citation is used to confirm or back up the citing authors' work. In this case, the citation is supporting the idea that phloem structure affects pathogen movement, which is a key point in the passage. There's no indication of comparison, motivation, or criticism here, so Support seems to be the most appropriate class.
