Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage says: "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@." This seems to be a neutral statement just providing information about when the use of these devices started in the USA. There's no indication that the citation is being used to support a point, compare methods, or criticize previous work.

Next, I'll identify the general intent. The sentence is simply stating a fact about the spread of magnetic water treatment devices. It doesn't seem to be trying to motivate further research, support a claim, or compare with another study. It's just a descriptive statement.

Looking at the predefined classes, the most appropriate one here is "Neutral." The citation is used to provide a factual statement without any supporting, comparing, or critical intent. It's just describing when the use began in the USA.
