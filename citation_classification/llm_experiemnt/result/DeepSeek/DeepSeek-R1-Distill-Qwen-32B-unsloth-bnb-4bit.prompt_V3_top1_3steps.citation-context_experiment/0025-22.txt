Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me start by understanding the task.

First, I have to extract the context around the citation. The passage provided is about the classification of plant viruses into monophyletic groups based on their coat protein genes. It mentions that the work of Adams et al. (2015) is the basis for this classification. 

Next, I need to identify the general intent of the citation. The context says that Adams et al.'s work is "the basis for this classification," which suggests that their research is foundational to the current study. They're using Adams et al.'s work as the starting point or foundation for their own classification.

Now, looking at the predefined classes, the most appropriate one here is "Basis" because the citation is directly referencing the foundational work that supports the current research. It's not comparing methods or results, nor is it supporting, motivating, or critiquing the cited work. Instead, it's clearly stating that Adams et al.'s work is the intellectual foundation for their classification.

I don't think it's any other class because the context isn't about comparing results or methods, nor is it pointing out weaknesses or suggesting future research. It's purely about establishing the basis for their work.

The citation is used to establish the foundational work that underpins the current study's classification. 

**Basis**
