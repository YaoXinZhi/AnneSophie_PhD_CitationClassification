Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me go through the steps.

First, the context provided is: "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@." 

Step 1: Extract the context. The sentence is straightforwardâ€”it's stating that magnetic water treatment devices have been spreading in the USA since 1975, and the citation is just a reference to this fact.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation is used to provide a factual statement without any comparison, motivation, support, or criticism. It's just a neutral mention of when the spread started.

Step 3: Select the specific rhetorical class. The predefined list includes Neutral, which fits here because the citation is used descriptively without any argumentative intent. It's just stating a fact and citing the source without using it to support, compare, or criticize anything.

So, the label should be Neutral.
