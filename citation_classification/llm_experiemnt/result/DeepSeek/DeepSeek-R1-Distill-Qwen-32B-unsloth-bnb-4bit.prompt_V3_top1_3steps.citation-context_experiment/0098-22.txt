Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a scientific article citation passage and wants me to classify the cited work into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. 

First, I need to understand the context of the citation. The passage is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@."

Looking at this, the author is comparing their current results with those from a previous study. The key word here is "differ," which indicates a comparison between results. 

Next, I should identify the general intent. Since the author is contrasting their findings with another study's results, this falls under a comparative intent. 

Now, looking at the specific rhetorical classes, the options under comparative are CoCoGM, CoCoRes, and CoCoXY. CoCoRes specifically refers to comparing results or findings. The passage directly contrasts the results of two experiments, so CoCoRes is the most appropriate here.

I don't see any elements of motivation, support, or weakness. It's purely a comparison of results without any additional context like justification or criticism. 

Therefore, the correct classification is CoCoRes.
