Okay, I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by understanding the context and the task.

The task is to assign a rhetorical class to the citation based on how it's used in the passage. The predefined classes are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Motivation, Future, Support, Similar, Usage, Weakness, and Neutral.

First, I should extract the context around the citation. The passage is about plant health, specifically mentioning the use of magnetic fields to prevent hard water scaling. It cites a previous study that showed the effectiveness of magnetic treatment but noted that the mechanism wasn't explained. The current work aims to understand this mechanism.

So, the citation is used to explain why the current research is being conducted. It points out a knowledge gapâ€”the mechanism isn't understood yet. This is a motivation for the current study.

Looking at the classes, Motivation is when the citation justifies why the current research is being done, like identifying a knowledge gap. The example given for Motivation fits this scenario: a previous study showed results, but the mechanism isn't explained, so the current work is motivated to address that gap.

I don't think it's Support because the current work isn't confirming the previous results but rather building on them. It's not a comparison, so CoCo classes don't fit. It's not Usage because they aren't using a method from the cited work. It's not Weakness because they aren't criticizing the previous study. It's definitely not Neutral because they are using it to justify their work.

Therefore, the rhetorical class is Motivation.
