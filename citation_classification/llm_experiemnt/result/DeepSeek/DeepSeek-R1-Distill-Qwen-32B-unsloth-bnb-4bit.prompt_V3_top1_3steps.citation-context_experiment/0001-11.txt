Okay, so I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the passage provided. It says, "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." My task is to figure out what the citation is doing here.

Step 1: Extract the context. The context is the sentence itself. It mentions that the experimental setup was described in detail previously, citing the source. So the citation is referring to a previous description of their experimental setup.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The sentence is referring to a method or setup that was used in a previous study. The authors are pointing to where they previously detailed their experimental setup. So this seems to be about using a method from a prior work.

Looking at the general intents, the one that fits is "Technical," which is about using a method, tool, dataset, or setup from another work. So the general intent is Technical.

Step 3: Assign the specific rhetorical class. The predefined classes include Usage, which is exactly about referring to a method or setup used in the current study. The example given for Usage is similar: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." That's exactly the case here.

So putting it all together, the citation is used to refer to the method or setup used in the current study, which falls under the Usage category.
