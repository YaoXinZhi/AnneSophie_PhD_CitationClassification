Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let's go through the steps.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the study by @@CITATION@@ reports the presence of a specific pathogen in a plant species. It also notes that the authors found the same pathogen in another plant species, supporting the study's findings.

Next, I'll identify the general intent. The citation is being used to back up the current study's results, so it's supportive.

Now, looking at the specific classes, Support is the most appropriate because the citation confirms the findings of the current research.

The citation is used to support the findings of the current study by confirming the presence of the pathogen, indicating a supportive intent.

**Answer:** Support
