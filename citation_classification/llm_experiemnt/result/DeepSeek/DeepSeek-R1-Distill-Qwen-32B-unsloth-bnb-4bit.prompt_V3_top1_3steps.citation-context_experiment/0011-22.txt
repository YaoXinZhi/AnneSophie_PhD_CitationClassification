Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me go through the process step by step.

First, I'll look at the context provided. The passage is about a study where the authors compared the effects of magnetic treatment on hard water scale formation. They mention that their previous research, cited as @@CITATION@@, showed that magnetic fields could prevent scale formation. However, the mechanism behind this effect wasn't explained, which is why they're conducting this new study.

Now, I need to extract the context discussing the citation. The key part is that the previous research demonstrated the effectiveness of magnetic fields but didn't explain how it worked. The current study aims to address this gap.

Next, identifying the general intent. The citation is used to highlight a knowledge gap. The authors are pointing out that while their previous work showed results, the mechanism wasn't understood, hence motivating their current research. This falls under the Motivational category.

Looking at the predefined classes, Motivation is the label for when a citation justifies why the current research is being conducted, such as identifying a knowledge gap or open question. The example given for Motivation is very similar, where previous research showed results but didn't explain the mechanism, leading to the current study.

So, putting it all together, the citation is used to explain why this new research is necessary because the previous work didn't address the mechanism. Therefore, the rhetorical class is Motivation.

The citation is used to justify the current research by identifying a knowledge gap in understanding the mechanism behind magnetic treatment's effectiveness.

**Motivation**
