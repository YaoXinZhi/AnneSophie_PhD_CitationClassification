Okay, I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me start by understanding the task. The user provided a passage where a citation is tagged, and I have to classify that citation into one of the predefined rhetorical classes.

First, I should extract the context around @@CITATION@@. The passage says, "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@." So the citation is supporting a statement about the spread of magnetic water treatment devices in the USA starting in 1975.

Next, I need to identify the general intent. The citation is providing evidence to back up the statement about the spread of these devices. It's not comparing methods or results, nor is it motivating future research or pointing out a weakness. It's simply stating a fact with a reference, so the intent is descriptive.

Looking at the predefined classes, the closest match is "Neutral" because the citation is used in a descriptive way without supporting, comparing, or criticizing anything. It's just providing a factual reference.

So, the rhetorical class for this citation is Neutral.
