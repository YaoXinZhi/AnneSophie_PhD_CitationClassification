Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by understanding the context and the task.

First, the passage is about plant health, and the citation is part of a scientific article. My job is to determine the rhetorical class of this citation. The possible classes are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Motivation, Future, Support, Similar, Usage, Weakness, and Neutral.

Looking at the passage, it mentions that the citation discusses the multiplication rates and concentration of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains in young leaves and roots of infected daisy plants. It also notes conflicting results for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima. 

So, the context here is comparing two studies. One study reports high rates in daisy plants, while another describes conflicting results in a different plant. The citation is being used to point out that there's a discrepancy between these two studies. 

In the definitions, CoCoXY is when the citation compares or contrasts two cited studies with each other, not with the citing paper. That seems to fit here because the passage is comparing the results of two different studies cited in the same sentence. 

I don't think it's any other class like Support or Weakness because it's not supporting or criticizing the current work but rather comparing two cited works. It's also not about usage or motivation. So, the most appropriate class is CoCoXY.
