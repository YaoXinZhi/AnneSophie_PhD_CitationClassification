Okay, so I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. Let me go through the steps as outlined.

First, I'll extract the context discussing the citation. The passage is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@."

Looking at this, the context is about comparing the results of the current work with those of the cited study. The key part is "substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted..." which indicates a comparison between two sets of results.

Next, I need to identify the general intent. Since the citation is comparing results, the general intent is Comparative. From the list, Comparative can be further broken down into CoCoGM, CoCoRes, or CoCoXY. 

Now, I have to determine which specific class it fits. The passage is comparing the results of the current work with those of the cited study. The example given for CoCoRes is a direct comparison of results, which matches this scenario. The other options like CoCoGM (goals or methods) or CoCoXY (comparing two cited studies) don't fit here because the comparison is between the current work and the cited study, not their goals or two other studies.

So, the most appropriate rhetorical class is CoCoRes.
