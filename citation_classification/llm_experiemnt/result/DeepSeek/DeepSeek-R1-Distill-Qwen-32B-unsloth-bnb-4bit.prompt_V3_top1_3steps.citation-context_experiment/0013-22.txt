Okay, I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by understanding the context and the task.

First, the task is to classify the citation into one of the predefined rhetorical classes: Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Motivation, Future, Support, Similar, Usage, Weakness, or Neutral. 

The passage given is: "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@."

Step 1 is to extract the context discussing the citation. The context here is about the spread of magnetic water treatment devices in the USA since 1975. The citation is just providing a reference for this statement.

Step 2 is to identify the general intent. The citation is used to provide information about the spread of these devices without any comparison, support, motivation, or criticism. It's just a factual statement.

Looking at the definitions, Neutral is when the citation is used in a neutral, descriptive way without supporting, comparing, criticizing, or motivating any specific argument. This fits because the citation is simply stating a fact about the spread of the devices without any further analysis or comparison.

So, the rhetorical class should be Neutral.
