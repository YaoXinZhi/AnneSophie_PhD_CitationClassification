Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by extracting the context around the citation. The passage is about plant health, specifically mentioning studies on the multiplication rates and conflicting results of a phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima. The citation is used to highlight these conflicting results.

Next, I need to identify the general intent. The citation is pointing out that there are conflicting results between two studies. This suggests that the authors are comparing the findings of these two cited works. They aren't comparing their own results with others or using the citation to support their own findings. Instead, they're showing that different studies have different outcomes on the same topic.

Looking at the rhetorical classes, CoCoXY is used when comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies without involving the citing paper. Since the passage is discussing conflicting results from two studies cited together, this fits CoCoXY. The authors are not directly comparing their work to either study but are noting the discrepancy between the two cited works.

So, the appropriate label here is CoCoXY.
