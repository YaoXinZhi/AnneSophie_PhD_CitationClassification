Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific article passage. Let me go through the steps carefully.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the citation is about the introduction of magnetic water treatment devices in the USA since 1975. The sentence is: "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@."

Next, I need to identify the general intent of this citation. The sentence is a factual statement about the spread of magnetic water treatment devices. It's providing information without any comparison, support, criticism, motivation, or technical usage. It's just stating a fact.

Now, looking at the predefined rhetorical classes, the Neutral class fits here. The citation is used descriptively without supporting, comparing, or motivating any specific argument in the current paper. It's simply providing background information.

So, the appropriate label should be Neutral.
