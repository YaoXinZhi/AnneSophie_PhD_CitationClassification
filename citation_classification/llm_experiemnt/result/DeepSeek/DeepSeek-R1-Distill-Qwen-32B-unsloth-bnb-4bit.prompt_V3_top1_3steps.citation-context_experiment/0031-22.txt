Okay, I need to determine the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me start by understanding the context provided.

The context is a scientific article passage where the citation is mentioned. The passage says: "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@@."

So, the authors are talking about their finding that insect hosts influence bacterial communities. They mention that this finding is supported by recent studies (cross-taxon investigations) on other insect-associated bacteria. The example given is about fleas and ticks, where the arthropod host affects bacterial assemblages, unlike rodent hosts and environmental factors.

Now, I need to figure out the intent behind citing @@CITATION@@ here. The authors are using the cited work to back up their own findings. They're saying that their results align with what others have found in similar contexts. The citation is being used to confirm or corroborate their findings, which means it's providing support.

Looking at the predefined classes, the Support category is when the citation is used to support or confirm the work of the citing authors. In this case, the cited work supports the authors' findings about the influence of insect hosts on bacterial communities.

I should make sure it's not Similar, which points out a similarity between studies, but here the focus is on supporting the current findings rather than just noting a similarity. Also, it's not Usage since they're not using a method or tool from the cited work. It's definitely not Weakness because they're not criticizing the cited work.

So, the most appropriate label here is Support.
