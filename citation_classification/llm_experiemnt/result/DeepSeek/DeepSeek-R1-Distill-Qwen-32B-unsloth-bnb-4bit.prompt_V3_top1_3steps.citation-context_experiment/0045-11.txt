Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to classify the citation in the given context. Let me go through the steps one by one.

First, I need to extract the context discussing the citation @@CITATION@@. The passage is about a study where the authors found that the application of magnetic fields reduces scale formation in hard water. They reference a previous study that showed similar results. The context is: "Our previous research @@CITATION@@ has shown that the formation of the hard calcite scale on the surfaces exposed to hard water can be successfully prevented with the applied magnetic field."

So, the authors are citing their own previous work to show that they've already demonstrated the effectiveness of magnetic fields in preventing scale formation. Now, in this current study, they're looking into the mechanism behind this effect.

Next, I need to identify the general intent of the citation. The authors are using the citation to support their current work by referencing their own prior findings. This seems to be a supportive intent because they're confirming that their current research builds on established results.

Now, looking at the specific rhetorical classes, the most appropriate one here is "Support." The citation is used to confirm that their previous work has already shown the effectiveness, which supports their current investigation into the mechanism.

I don't think it's "Basis" because they're not establishing a foundational theory but rather confirming prior results. It's not a comparison, so "CoCoGM," "CoCoRes," or "CoCoXY" don't fit. It's also not motivational, future-oriented, similar to another study, a usage of a method, a weakness, or neutral. It's clearly supporting their current work by referencing their own previous findings.

The citation is used to support the current research by referencing prior findings, confirming the effectiveness of magnetic fields in preventing scale formation, which supports the investigation into the mechanism.

**Answer:** Support
