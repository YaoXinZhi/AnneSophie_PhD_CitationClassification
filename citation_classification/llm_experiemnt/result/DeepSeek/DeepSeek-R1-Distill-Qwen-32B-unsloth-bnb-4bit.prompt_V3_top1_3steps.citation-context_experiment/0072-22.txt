Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific article passage. Let's start by looking at the context provided.

The passage mentions that the citation is discussing the "taxonomic status of these species" and points out that some may not develop on Pyrus. The key words here are "problematic" and "some may not develop." This indicates that the author is pointing out limitations or issues in the cited work.

Looking at the predefined classes, the one that fits this scenario is "Weakness." This class is used when the citation is criticizing or pointing out flaws in the cited work. The example provided for Weakness also involves questioning the taxonomic status, which aligns with what's happening here.

So, the citation is highlighting a weakness in the previous study, making "Weakness" the appropriate label.

Weakness
