Alright, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let's start by understanding the context provided.

The context is about a study where the authors observed that applying magnetic fields can prevent the formation of hard calcite scales in hard water. They mention that their previous research showed this effect but didn't explain the mechanism. Now, they're conducting this new work to understand why the magnetic treatment works.

Looking at the sentence: "Our previous research @@CITATION@@ has shown that the formation of the hard calcite scale on the surfaces exposed to hard water can be successfully prevented with the applied magnetic field. The explanation of the phenomena is not yet offered and the purpose of this work is to try to understand the mechanism of the beneficial influence of the magnetic treatment."

The citation is referring to their own past work, which demonstrated the effectiveness of magnetic fields in preventing scale formation. The current paper is building on this by seeking to explain the mechanism behind it. So, the purpose of citing their previous work is to establish a foundation for their current research. They are showing that there's a known effect (scale prevention) but that the underlying reason isn't understood, hence the motivation for their current study.

In the step-by-step process, the general intent is Foundational, which corresponds to the Basis class. The citation is used to introduce the intellectual foundation of their current research, showing that their work builds upon established findings. They are not comparing methods or results, nor are they supporting their own findings or pointing out weaknesses. It's purely establishing the basis for their new research.

So, the rhetorical class here is Basis because the citation is setting up the foundation for their current study by referencing prior work that established the phenomenon they're now seeking to explain.
