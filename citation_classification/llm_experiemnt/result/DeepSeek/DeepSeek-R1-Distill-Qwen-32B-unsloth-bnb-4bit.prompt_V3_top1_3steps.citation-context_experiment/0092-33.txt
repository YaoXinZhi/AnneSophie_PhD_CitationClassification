Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage says: "The experimental setup was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." So the citation is referring to a previous study where the experimental setup was detailed.

Next, I need to determine the general intent of the citation. Since the current paper is using the experimental setup from the cited work, it seems like they're referencing a method or tool used in their study.

Looking at the predefined classes, the Usage category refers to when a citation is used to refer to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup that is directly used in the current study. In this case, the citation is clearly pointing out that the experimental setup was used from the previous work.

I don't think it's any other category because they're not comparing, supporting, or critiquing the cited work. They're simply stating that they used the setup described there. So the most appropriate label here is Usage.
