Alright, I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let's start by understanding the context. The passage is about a study that used a specific method to detect plant pathogens in mango trees. They mention that this method is a standard one, which suggests it's commonly accepted or widely used in the field.

Next, I need to determine the general intent of the citation. Since the citation is pointing out that the method is standard, it's likely supporting the validity or reliability of their approach. They're not comparing it to another method or pointing out weaknesses; instead, they're confirming that their method is widely recognized.

Looking at the predefined classes, "Support" seems appropriate here because the citation is used to back up the method used in the current study. The example given for Support is when a citation confirms previous research, which aligns with this case.

I don't think it's "Usage" because they're not just using the method from the cited work; they're referencing it to support their choice. It's also not "Basis" because the cited work isn't foundational but rather a standard practice. There's no comparison involved, so "CoCoGM" or "CoCoRes" doesn't fit. It's definitely not a "Weakness" or "Neutral" because they're affirming the method's validity.

So, putting it all together, the citation is used to support the methodology, making "Support" the correct rhetorical class.

The citation @@CITATION@@ is used to support the methodology by referencing a standard method, confirming its validity.
