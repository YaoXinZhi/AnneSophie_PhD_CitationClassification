Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in this plant health context. Let's start by breaking down the passage. The sentence is about how the formation of hard calcite scale on surfaces exposed to hard water can be prevented with a magnetic field, and the current work aims to understand the mechanism behind this. The citation is mentioned in the context of their previous research showing this prevention. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The key part is that the authors refer to their own previous work to justify why they're conducting this new research. They're pointing out that while the magnetic field prevents scaling, the mechanism isn't understood yet. This sets up the motivation for their current study.

Next, identifying the general intent. Since they're citing their own work to explain why this research is necessary, it's about justification. That points towards the Motivation category. They're identifying a knowledge gap—the mechanism isn't explained—so their current research is motivated by this need.

Looking at the specific rhetorical classes, Motivation fits because it's used to justify the current research by highlighting a gap or open question. They're not comparing methods or results, nor are they supporting or criticizing previous work. It's purely about why they're doing this study now.

So, putting it all together, the citation is used to explain the motivation behind their research, pointing out an unaddressed mechanism. Therefore, the rhetorical class is Motivation.
