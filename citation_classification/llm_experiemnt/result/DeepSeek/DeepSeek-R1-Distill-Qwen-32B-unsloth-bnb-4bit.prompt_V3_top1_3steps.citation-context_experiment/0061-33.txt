Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me go through the steps one by one.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage says: "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@@."

So, the context is about supporting a finding with another study. The authors found that insect hosts affect bacterial communities, and they're citing another study that supports this finding with similar results in fleas and ticks.

Next, I need to identify the general intent. The citation is used to back up their own finding, so it's supportive. Looking at the predefined classes, that would fall under either Support or Similar.

Now, the specific rhetorical class. The example given for Support is when the citation confirms the work or findings. Here, the cited work supports their own findings by showing similar results in a different context (fleas and ticks instead of insects). So it's more about supporting their conclusion rather than just pointing out a similarity.

Therefore, the most appropriate label is Support.
