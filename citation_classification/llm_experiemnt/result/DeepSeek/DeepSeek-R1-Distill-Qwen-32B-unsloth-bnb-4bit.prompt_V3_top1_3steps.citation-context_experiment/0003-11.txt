Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me go through the steps carefully.

First, I'll extract the context discussing the citation. The passage says: "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@@."

So, the context is about supporting a finding. The authors are saying that their finding is supported by other recent studies, specifically mentioning that in fleas and ticks, the arthropod host influenced bacterial assemblages, while other factors didn't.

Next, I need to identify the general intent. The citation is used to support their own finding, so the intent is supportive. Looking at the predefined classes, Support is the category for citations used to confirm or support the citing authors' work.

Now, selecting the specific rhetorical class. The example given for Support is when the citation supports the authors' work, which matches exactly what's happening here. The authors are citing another study to back up their own results.

So, putting it all together, the rhetorical class should be Support.
