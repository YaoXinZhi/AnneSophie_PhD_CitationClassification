Okay, I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let's start by understanding the context.

The passage says: "Our previous research @@CITATION@@ has shown that the formation of the hard calcite scale on the surfaces exposed to hard water can be successfully prevented with the applied magnetic field. The explanation of the phenomena is not yet offered and the purpose of this work is to try to understand the mechanism of the beneficial influence of the magnetic treatment."

So, the citation is referring to the author's own previous work. The context mentions that their previous research showed a certain result, and now they're building on that by trying to understand the mechanism behind it. This seems to be justifying why they're conducting the current research because there's a gap in understanding the mechanism.

Looking at the definitions, the Motivation class is used when the citation justifies why the current research is being done, like identifying a knowledge gap. The passage fits this because they're pointing out that while their previous work showed a result, the explanation is still lacking, hence motivating the new study.

I don't think it's Basis because it's not establishing the foundation but rather building on their own work. It's not a comparison, so CoCo classes don't apply. It's not supporting or similar either. The intent is clearly to motivate the current research by pointing out a gap, so Motivation is the right class.
