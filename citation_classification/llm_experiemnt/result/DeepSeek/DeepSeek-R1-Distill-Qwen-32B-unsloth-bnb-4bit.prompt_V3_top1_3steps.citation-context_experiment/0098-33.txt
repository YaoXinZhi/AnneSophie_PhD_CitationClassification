Okay, I need to determine the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by extracting the context. The passage mentions that the citation discusses the fast multiplication rates and high concentration of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains in young leaves and roots, but also notes conflicting results for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima. 

So, the context is about comparing results from different studies. The citation is used to point out conflicting results between two studies. This means the author is comparing the explanations or claims made by these two cited works. 

Looking at the definitions, CoCoXY is when the citation compares two studies with each other, not with the current paper. The example given is similar, where conflicting results are mentioned between two studies. 

Therefore, the rhetorical class here is CoCoXY.
