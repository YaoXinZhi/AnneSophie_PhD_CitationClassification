Okay, I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let's start by understanding the context.

The passage says, "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@." This is a statement about the spread of a technology in the USA without any additional commentary or comparison. It's just stating a fact.

Looking at the definitions, "Neutral" refers to citations used in a descriptive way without supporting, comparing, criticizing, or motivating any specific argument. Since the passage is simply providing information without any further analysis or intent, the citation is neutral.

So, the rhetorical class here is Neutral.
