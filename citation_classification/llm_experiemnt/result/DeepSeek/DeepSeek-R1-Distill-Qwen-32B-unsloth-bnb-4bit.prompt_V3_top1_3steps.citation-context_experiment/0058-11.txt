Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by reading the context provided.

The passage is about plant health, specifically mentioning that "Plant parasitic nematodes are one of the most destructive groups of plant pathogens." It then cites a source, @@CITATION@@, which is referenced in the sentence: "This is supported by recent studies @@CITATION@@ that have shown their impact on crop yield and global food security."

First, I need to extract the context discussing the citation. The sentence mentions that the impact of plant parasitic nematodes on crop yield and food security is supported by recent studies cited. So the context is about supporting the statement with evidence from other studies.

Next, I should identify the general intent of the citation. The sentence uses the citation to back up the claim that these nematodes are destructive. The word "supported" indicates that the cited work is used to confirm or back up the current assertion. So the general intent seems to be supportive.

Now, looking at the predefined rhetorical classes, the Support category is when the citation is used to support or confirm the work, result, or finding of the citing authors. The example given for Support is when a previous study's results are consistent with the current findings, which aligns with this case because the citation is used to back up the claim about the impact of nematodes.

I don't think it's any of the other categories. It's not a comparison (so not CoCoGM, CoCoRes, or CoCoXY), nor is it foundational (Basis) because it's not introducing a new concept. It's not motivational or suggesting future research, so Motivation or Future don't fit. It's not pointing out a weakness in the cited work or a similarity, so Weakness or Similar aren't appropriate. It's not a method or tool usage either, so Usage isn't correct. Lastly, it's not neutral because it's being used to support a point, not just to mention it.

Therefore, the most appropriate label is Support.

The citation is used to support the claim about the impact of plant parasitic nematodes, confirming the assertion with recent studies.

**Support**
