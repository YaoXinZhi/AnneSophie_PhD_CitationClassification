Alright, I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by reading the context carefully.

The passage says, "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@." So, the citation is providing a fact about the spread of these devices in the USA starting from 1975. 

Looking at the definitions, the citation isn't supporting the current work, nor is it comparing or contrasting with other studies. It's just stating a historical fact without any evaluative language. 

So, this seems to fit the "Neutral" category because it's a descriptive mention without any supporting, critical, or motivational intent.
