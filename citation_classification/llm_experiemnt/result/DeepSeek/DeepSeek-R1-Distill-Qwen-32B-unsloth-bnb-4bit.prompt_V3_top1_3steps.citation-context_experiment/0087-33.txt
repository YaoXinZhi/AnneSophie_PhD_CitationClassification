Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in the given passage. Let me go through the steps as outlined.

First, I need to extract the context discussing the citation @@CITATION@@. The passage is about the multiplication rates and conflicting results regarding phytoplasma in different plant species. The citation is mentioned in the context of conflicting results, specifically comparing findings from two studies: one where high concentrations were found in certain plants, and another where conflicting results were reported for a different phytoplasma.

Next, I need to identify the general intent of the citation. It seems like the authors are comparing two studies to highlight the discrepancies in their findings. They're not using the citation to support their own results or to motivate their research. Instead, they're pointing out that there's inconsistency between the studies.

Looking at the predefined classes, the most relevant ones here are CoCoRes and CoCoXY. CoCoRes is when the citation is used to compare results, and CoCoXY is when two cited studies are compared with each other. In this case, the passage is comparing the results of two different studies (Wei et al., 2004 and Saracco et al., 2006) to show conflicting outcomes. So, it's a comparison between the two cited works, not between the citing paper and another study.

Therefore, the rhetorical class should be CoCoXY because it's comparing two cited studies to each other, pointing out their conflicting results.
