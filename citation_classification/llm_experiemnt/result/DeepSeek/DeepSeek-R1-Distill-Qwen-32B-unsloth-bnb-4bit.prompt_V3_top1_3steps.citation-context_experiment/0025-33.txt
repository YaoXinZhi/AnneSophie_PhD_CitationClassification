Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm supposed to classify a citation in a scientific article passage into one of several predefined rhetorical classes. The citation is marked as @@CITATION@@, and I need to figure out the context, intent, and then assign the correct label.

First, I'll read through the context provided. The passage mentions that the citation is discussing the multiplication rates and conflicting results regarding phytoplasma in different plant species. It specifically contrasts the findings of Wei et al., 2004 and Saracco et al., 2006 with another study. The key here is that the citation is comparing two studies to each other, not directly to the current paper.

Looking at the definitions, CoCoXY is for when the citation compares or contrasts two studies with each other. The example given is similar, where conflicting results from two studies are mentioned. In this case, the citation is pointing out conflicting results between Wei et al. and Saracco et al., which fits the CoCoXY category because it's comparing explanations or claims from two different studies.

I considered other options like CoCoRes, which compares results with the current paper, but here it's comparing two cited works. So, CoCoXY is the most appropriate.
