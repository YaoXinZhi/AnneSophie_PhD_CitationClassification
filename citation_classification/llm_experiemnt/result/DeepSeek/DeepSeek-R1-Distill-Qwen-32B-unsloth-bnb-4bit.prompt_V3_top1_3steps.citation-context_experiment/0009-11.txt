Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by understanding the context. The passage is about the application of magnetic fields to prevent hard calcite scale formation. The authors mention that their previous research showed this prevention but haven't explained the mechanism yet. They're now trying to understand why it works. 

So, the citation here is referring to their own previous work. The intent seems to be explaining why they're doing this current research. They're pointing out a gap in their previous findingsâ€”specifically, that while they've observed the effect, they haven't figured out how it happens. This is a motivation for their current study. 

Looking at the rhetorical classes, Motivation fits here because they're justifying their research by highlighting a knowledge gap. They're not comparing methods or results with others, nor are they supporting their current findings. It's more about why they're conducting the study now. 

I think the correct label is Motivation.
