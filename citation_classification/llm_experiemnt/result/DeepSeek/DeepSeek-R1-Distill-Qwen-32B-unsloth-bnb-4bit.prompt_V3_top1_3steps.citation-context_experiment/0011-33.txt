Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me start by understanding the task step by step.

First, I have to extract the context around the citation. The passage is about the impact of magnetic treatment on calcite scale formation. It mentions that previous research showed the prevention of scale formation but didn't explain the mechanism. The current work aims to understand this mechanism, citing @@CITATION@@.

Now, I need to identify the general intent. The citation is referring to prior research that established the phenomenon but didn't explain it. This seems foundational because it's setting the stage for the current study. The authors are building on this previous work, so it's about the intellectual foundation.

Next, I have to select the specific rhetorical class. Since the citation is about the basis of their research, the appropriate label would be "Basis." It's not a comparison, support, or motivation beyond establishing the foundation.

So, putting it all together, the citation is used to introduce the foundational research that the current study builds upon. Therefore, the rhetorical class is Basis.
