Okay, let's start by looking at the context given. The user provided a task where I need to classify the rhetorical classes for a citation tagged @@CITATION@@ in a plant health context. First, I need to follow the steps outlined.

Step 1 is extracting the context around @@CITATION@@. But wait, the user hasn't provided the actual passage. Hmm, that's an issue. Wait, maybe I missed the passage? Let me check again. Oh, the user's input doesn't include the citation context here. They just outlined the task and definitions. Wait, that's a problem because I need the specific sentence where the citation is located. Without the passage, I can't analyze the context. Oh no! 

Wait, perhaps there's an error in the question setup. The user might have forgotten to include the passage. Since I can only see the task description but no actual text with @@CITATION@@, I can't proceed properly. Maybe I should ask for the passage first? But the user says "please strictly follow this format" and to not provide any explanations. 

Hmm, but in the problem statement given, the user provided an example. Wait, the user might have pasted the example task but not the real input. Wait, actually looking back at the user's message, under the task, it's written "Below are the fined-grained...". Wait, perhaps there is no example citation in this question. 

Wait maybe I need to check again. Wait in the user's input, the task is to output the top three rhetorical classes for @@CITATION@@ given the passage, but in the provided message, there's no actual citation context with @@CITATION@@. Wait the user's input just contains the instructions and definitions. The example given (the output example) shows how the output should be formatted. Without the actual citation's context, I can't classify it. 

Therefore, maybe there's a mistake here. But since I have to follow the user's instructions, perhaps they intended to provide a context that's missing here. Wait, in the initial problem statement, maybe I missed something? Let me re-read the user's entire query again.

Looking again: The user starts by saying "You are a classifier..." and gives the steps. Then under Context, they say "You are a classifier. For the citation marked @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific passage, output the top three..." But looking at the user's input, the actual passage isn't provided. So the example passage and citation context are missing. 

This is a problem. Without the specific text where the citation is placed, I can't extract context or determine intent. But perhaps there was a past example in the initial message? Wait, in the "CONTEXT" section, it says "the given scientific passage", but the problem includes the task without any passage with @@CITATION@@. 

Hmm, this seems like an error in the user's input. Since I can't proceed without more information, maybe I should output an error message, but the user said not to provide any explanations beyond the reasoning and JSON. Wait the user's final instruction says "Return only the top three rhetorical classes". Wait, but if there's no context, I can't do that. 

Wait, maybe there's an example provided in the user's message that I missed? Looking at the definitions, they have examples. For instance, the example under Basis shows that the citation introduced and validated the IAT. But the user wants me to process a specific citation in their scenario, which they didn't provide here. 

Alternatively, perhaps the example given in the Basis definition is actually the input for me to use? Let me check again. Under the "Basis" example, the citation is introduced: “@@CITATION@@ introduced and validated the IAT…” but in the example, the citation isn't about plant health specifically, but maybe that's just an example. However, the user's task is in plant health domain. 

Wait, perhaps this question is a test, and the user provided an example, expecting me to apply it. For instance, using the example provided under Basis to see if I can classify it. Wait, in the user's instructions, they said "You are a classifier...", and the predefined classes are listed. The example under basis is the first example. Wait, but maybe the user's actual task here is that this is an example, but they want testing the system? Maybe the task here is to process the Basis example given. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to paste a citation context but missed it. Given that, I'll have to proceed with the information given. Wait, maybe the example in the Basis section is the given context. Let me recheck the example:

The Basis example says: “@@CITATION@@ introduced and validated the IAT by studying biases...”

Suppose this is the example passage provided in the user's input (though perhaps it's only an example in the definition). Maybe the user expects the assistant to analyze their own example for Basis, but the question might be to process this example. Wait, in the user's problem description, they might have included the example from the Basis section as the input context. Since there is no actual context given, perhaps the user made a mistake.

Alternatively, since I was told to act as though I have to process this request, maybe I have to assume the example given is the test case? Let me think. The user's question may have an error, but proceeding as best as I can:

Suppose the citation context is: "Our previous research @@CITATION@@ has shown that the formation...".

Wait, but actually, the Motivation example is that. For Motivation example. The user's instructions specify that the example given under Motivation is:

Our previous research @@CITATION@@ has shown that the formation of the hard calcite scale... 

So in that example, the citation is for Motivation, right? Because it's using the previous work to justify the current research's purpose. 

Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to answer with the example given in the Basis section? For instance, the example under Basis is:

"Basis: ... 'introduced and validated the IAT.. so we replicated their results'". 

So if that's the citation's context, then Basis would be the top.

Alternatively, maybe the user expects me to use one of the examples given in the class definitions for testing? Since the task was "given scientific article citation passage", but no passage is given except examples.

Wait, in the user's provided task, they might have intended to include a citation passage but forgot, so I need to inform them. But since they said not to provide explanations, I'm stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the actual test case is one of the examples in the class definitions, like the Basis example. Let's try processing the Basis example as if that's the given context.

Taking the Basis example's context:

"introduced and validated the IAT by studying biases that they consider nearly universal in humans and about which there is no social concern. We began by replicating these inoffensive results for the same purposes." 

Here, @@CITATION@@ refers to the foundational work that the current study is replicating, so the intent is Foundational → Basis. That's what Basis is.

So the task is to output the top three. For this example context, Basis is first, and likely no other classes apply except maybe Neutral. But since the example says "introduced and validated... replicated...", it's definitely Basis as the top. The other two might be Neutral if it just states that, but since they mention replication, Support (the cited work supports theirs), so maybe Support is second? Let's see:

Wait the Support example is "supported by previous research...", so in the Basis example's case, the current work is replicating the cited work's results, so they are supporting their own by using the cited basis. Or is it that the Basis is the foundational work, so the citation is Basis (Basis is more about intellectual foundation), so Support would be if they used it to back their results.

In this example, they are replicating the cited work's findings, which aligns with Basis as the primary. The other two might be Neutral if there's no criticism or comparison. Or maybe CoCoRes? No, because it's replication, not comparison of results. Hence the top three would be Basis, then maybe Neutral (since they just state the cited work's existence), and perhaps Support if they are saying their research is supported by replication.

Wait but the definition for Support says "the citation is used to support, or confirm the work..." of the citing authors. Wait, in the Basis example, they replicate and build upon the cited work, so that is foundational. Therefore, Basis is first. The other classes:

Motivation? No, because they aren't using it to motivate their work but as a basis.

Support: Maybe the citing authors are using the previous work to support their approach. So maybe Support is also applicable?

Alternatively, the example says "they introduced, we replicated"—so that's Basis. 

The top three would be 1. Basis, 2. Support (since the replication supports their own work?), 3. ?? Maybe Neutral.

Alternatively, the example under Support's context is "Our finding...is supported by previous research...", which is similar to the Basis example's conclusion, but in the example for Support, the citation supports their new finding. But in Basis's example, the citation is the foundation for what they did. So perhaps Support is secondary here?

Alternatively, perhaps the primary is Basis, then Neutral as the secondary if there's no explicit support, but the example states "replicating these results"—so they use it support their own validity. Hence Support?

Wait, the example under Basis explicitly says it's a Basis case, so the top should be Basis. The other two could be Neutral or Support. Let me see definitions again:

Basis: intellectual foundation of current research. 

Support: to support their own work.

Because the example says "we replicated their results for the same purposes"—so their own research is based on the cited work's foundation, so Basis is first. The second might be Support since they're using it to validate their approach. But actually, replication could be part of being a basis. The support would be if they use previous results to back their own findings. Here, the Basis example's case is replicating, so maybe that's part of the basis. 

Alternatively, maybe another example from the definitions. Take the Future example: it's suggesting future research based on the citation, which is different. 

Wait, perhaps the user's actual intention is to test whether I can classify the Basis example correctly. In that case, the top three would be:

1. Basis

2. Support? Because they replicate it, which supports the method.

Wait the definition for Basis is about the foundation, and Support is when they use the citation to support their work's results. So in the Basis example, when they say "We began by replicating these inoffensive results for the same purposes." Their own work is building on it, so that's Basis. The replication might be part of the foundation. 

Alternatively, maybe the support is because they are using the previous work as their support for the method. So both are possible. Then third maybe Neutral, since no other comparison or weakness is mentioned. 

Thus the top 3 would be:

1. Basis

2. Support

3. Neutral

Alternatively, if support isn't applicable here, maybe the second is Motivation? No, because Motivation is when you use it to motivate the current work, like identifying a problem. 

Alternatively, the example given for Basis has the current work being an extension of the cited work, so Basis is first. There's no comparison, so not CoCo. No critical, so Weakness is out. So next would be Support, but is replication considered support? The definition says "support, or confirm the work". Since they replicated, then the cited work's method is supported by their own replication, but the other way around: they use it as the basis. Maybe the Support is if the prior work supports their finding, not the other way around.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Since the user's example explicitly under Basis says that example is "Basis", then the answer for that example would be Basis as the first. The question might be expecting that when presented with that instance.

Alternatively, maybe the user intended to present a different context, but since there is none, I can't do anything else. Given that, perhaps the correct answer for the Basis example is:

1. Basis  
2. Support  
3. Neutral  

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if there's no secondary intent, maybe Neutral and then something else? Maybe the second and third are Neutral and Motivation? Wait, in the basis example, they are replicating for the same purposes—so the current work's purpose is motivated? No, because it's the same purpose, so it's basis. 

Alternatively, the second is maybe not applicable, so the second and third are other classes, but since only three are needed, perhaps that's it. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the user's input, and the actual citation example given by the user is another. Since I have to work with what I have, perhaps I need to proceed with Basis as the top.
