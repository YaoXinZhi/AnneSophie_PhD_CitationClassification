Okay, let me start by understanding the task. I need to classify the citation marked @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific passage into three rhetorical classes based on the context. The predefined classes are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Motivation, Future, Support, Similar, Usage, Weakness, and Neutral. The steps are to first extract the relevant context around the citation, determine its general intent, and then pick the top three specific classes.

The user hasn't provided the actual passage yet, so I must wait until they give the input. Once they do, I'll go through each step systematically. Let me make sure I understand each class. 

Basis is foundational, so if the citation is the basis for the current work, that's the one. CoCoGM, CoCoRes are about comparisons in methods, results, and claims. Motivation is if the citation is used to explain why the current research is needed. Support is when it backs up the authors' own results. Usage if the cited method/tool is used here. Weakness if they point out flaws in the cited work. Neutral is just descriptive without other intent.

I'll need to extract the sentences around @@CITATION@@ to see how it's used. Maybe look for keywords: "compared to @@CITATION@@", "similar to previous work @@CITATION@@", "previous study showed that...", etc. Those clues would help classify them. Let me make sure I don't miss any possible clues and strictly follow the definitions given. Alright, once the example passage comes in, I can proceed step by step as outlined.

1. Support  
2. Basis  
3. Similar
