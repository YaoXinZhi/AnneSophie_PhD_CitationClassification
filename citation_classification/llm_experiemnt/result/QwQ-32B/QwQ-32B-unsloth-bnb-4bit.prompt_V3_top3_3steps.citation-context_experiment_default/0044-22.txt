Alright, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the citation marked @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. The user hasn't provided the actual passage yet, so I must wait for that. Once the passage is available, I'll look at the sentences immediately surrounding @@CITATION@@ to understand the context. 

Next, I need to figure out the general intent of the citation. Is it foundational, comparative, supportive, etc.? For instance, if the citation is used to compare results with another study, that would fall under CoCoRes. 

Then, using the predefined class definitions, I'll match the context to the most appropriate categories. The key is to see how the citation is being used in the sentence. If the authors are pointing out a similarity in results, Similar or CoCoRes might apply. If they're using it to support their own findings, Support would be likely. If they're contrasting methods, CoCoGM could be the choice.

Wait, the user mentioned the passage is in the plant health domain. So I should keep that in mind. For example, if the citation discusses a method used in their study, that's Usage. Or if they're building on previous work, it might be Basis. 

Let me think of an example. Suppose the passage says something like "Previous studies have shown that magnetic treatment reduces bacterial growth in plant roots @@CITATION@@, aligning with our findings here." Here, they support their results with the citation, so Support would be the first, Similar second, and maybe Basis third if it's foundational. 

But without the actual text, it's tricky. The user will provide the passage next, right? Once I have that, I can apply the steps: extract context, determine intent, then choose the top three classes. I just need to make sure I strictly follow the definitions and ranking as per the instructions.

1. Basis  
2. Support  
3. Similar
