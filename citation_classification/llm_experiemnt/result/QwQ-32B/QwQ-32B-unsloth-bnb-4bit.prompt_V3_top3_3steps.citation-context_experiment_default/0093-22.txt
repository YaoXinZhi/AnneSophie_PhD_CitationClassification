Okay, I need to figure out the top three rhetorical classes for the citation marked @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let's start with step 1, extracting the relevant context. The user provided the context as:

"The authors observed that the application of magnetic treatment significantly reduced bacterial growth in water systems, a result that aligns with previous findings @@CITATION@@. However, unlike studies using chemical inhibitors @@CITATION@@, magnetic treatment does not introduce harmful byproducts."

Alright, so the citation here is part of the first part: "aligns with previous findings @@CITATION@@." The second citation refers to chemical inhibitors, which is different. The first citation is about alignment with previous results.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The sentence says the current study's result "aligns with previous findings" cited. That suggests the citation is supporting their result, so the general intent is Supportive. From the list, Supportive could be Support or Similar. Let me check definitions again. The Support class is when the citation supports the citing authors' work. Here, the current work is aligning with the cited study, so it's using the citation to support their own result. That fits Support. 

But wait, could it be Similar? Because they are pointing out a similarity between their result and the cited work. The example for Similar is when there's a similarity in results, etc. The example given for Similar is: "our finding... is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations... @@CITATION@@", which is similar to the current case. Wait, the example for 'Support' is: previous research also found this, so using it to support their results. The example for Similar is when the two works are similar in results, not necessarily the same as supporting. The key here is that "aligns with previous findings" indicates that the cited study's results are similar to theirs, so maybe Similar is more accurate. Hmm, need to parse this.

Looking back at the definitions:

- Support: "to support, or confirm the work, result, or finding of the citing authors." So here, the cited work's findings support the current authors' results by showing agreement.

- Similar: "point out a similarity between the cited work and the citing paper... similarity can concern results, patterns, etc."

So both could apply here. The example for Support says: "All subscales were consistent with previous research, particularly that of @@CITATION@@... as before..." which resembles the current case of alignment. So "aligns with" here is supporting their result by citing prior work that found the same thing. So Support would be the primary. 

But let's check the Similar example: "our finding... is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations... @@CITATION@@", which is exactly what the example for Similar says. Wait, no, the example given for Support is "participants did not distinguish between personal interests and values..." which is similar. 

Wait, the example for Support says: "participants did not distinguish between personal interests and values as reasons for disputes, nor between competence and methods." The example is that their findings are consistent with the cited work. So the cited work's findings support their own, so Support is the correct class here. Thus, general intent is Supportive, so the specific classes could be Support, maybe Similar?

The next step is to rank the top three. Let's see the possible options.

So the citation is about previous findings that align with the current study's result. That's a support for their result, so Support is primary. Is there another class? Maybe Similar because it's pointing out the similarity. But the question is whether they are just stating similarity, which would be Similar, or using the citation to support their result, which is Support. The line is a bit blurry here. Let me check definitions again:

Support's example is when their findings are consistent with previous research (so citing to support their result by agreeing). So in the given example here, the current authors say their result aligns with previous findings, so they're using the citation to support their findings, so Support is correct.

Alternatively, Similar is when similarity is the main point. For instance, "similar to previous studies, we found...", perhaps. But in the example for Support, the wording is about consistency, which is similar to the scenario here. 

So the first choice is Support. 

What about second and third classes? Let's see: maybe Neutral? But the citation isn't just a neutral mention; it's actively being used to show agreement. 

Could there be another one? For instance, if the citation is foundational, but here it's not the basis for the current study, but rather supporting their findings. So Basis is not relevant here. 

Alternatively, Future, Motivation, etc., don't apply here. The other citation in the paragraph is about chemical inhibitors (unlike their method), but that's a different comparison. 

So the top classes would be Support, then maybe Similar as second? Wait, let me think again: "aligns with previous findings" implies similarity in results, so Similar could also fit. The Support class is for when the citation's work supports the current findings. Are these two classes overlapping here?

Looking at the definitions again: 

Support: "the citation is used to support, or confirm the work, result or finding of the citing authors."

So the cited work supports the citing authors' current findings. 

Similar: "point out a similarity between the cited work and the citing paper." The cited work has similar results, so they are pointing out that their results are similar. 

Hmm, so both could apply. Which takes precedence? The example for Support says "previous research, particularly that of @@CITATION@@ also using...", so the example does fit the scenario here. The current case: "aligns with previous findings" would align more with Support because it's using the prior work to back up the current result. 

Alternatively, the Similar class example's scenario is when two works show similar results, which is the case here. But the example given for Similar is when the citing paper's finding is "supported by" others, which uses 'supported by', which matches the Support definition. 

Wait, looking at the example for Similar:

The example is "In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@@", and the citing work says "our finding... is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations...". That example is used in the Similar class's example? Wait, no, the Similar example's text says: 

Wait, checking the example given for Similar: 

"The peptide also bound to gut epithelia of two other aphid species suggesting potential broader applicability @@CITATION@@", but that example is for 'Future'. Wait, no. Let me check again. 

Wait, the user provided examples:

Looking back, for Similar: 

Example: "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@@", so here, the citation is to a study that found similar results (host governed bacterial assemblages), supporting their own finding. But in this example, the cited citation is under the Similar class. Wait, the example is presented as an example for Similar. But why isn't it Support?

Wait, maybe I misread. Let me recheck:

The user wrote:

- Similar: example: "Our finding ... supported by recent cross-taxon investigations...", which is cited. 

But the description says Similar is when pointing out similarity. The example sentence says the cited work supports the finding, which would be Support. Hmm, confusion here. There's inconsistency in the examples. Wait no, looking again:

Wait, in the Similar example's explanation:

"The similarity can concern results, patterns, phenomena, or general observations."

The example given is the same as the Support example? Wait, no. Wait the example for Support is:

Example: “All subscales were consistent with previous research, particularly that of @@CITATION@@ also using a U.S. sample; as before, participants did not distinguish between personal interests and values as reasons for disputes, nor between competence and methods.”

So Support: they are using the citation to support their results with prior research's consistency.

In the Similar example: 

"The peptide also bound to gut epithelia of two other aphid species suggesting potential broader applicability @@CITATION@@", no that's Future's example. 

Wait, let me re-express the Similar example:

Wait the example under "Similar" is actually:

“Their finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxa investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent hosts and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@@.”

Wait, this example might actually be a typo, because in the instructions above, the example for 'Similar' is:

“Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@@.”

Ah, the example uses the word 'supported', but is under the Similar class. That suggests that "supported by" here is considered a similarity. But that seems conflicting. But according to the defined classes:

The Similar example is using "supported by" but under the Similar class. Wait, the user might have made a mistake, but we have to go by the definitions. Let me recheck definitions again:

The problem is the example for Similar uses "supported", but is listed under Similar. However, the definition says "the citation is used to point out a similarity between the cited work and the citing paper."

So in this example, the author's finding is supported (as in, similar results exist) so it's using the citation to note that there's a similarity in results. Hence, the example is under Similar even though the wording suggests support. 

Confusion arises because the same phrasing can be interpreted differently. So maybe in this case, the example from the user shows that when the author says their findings are supported by the cited work's results, it's both Support and Similar. 

But we need to choose the best fit. 

In the given task's example for Similar, the example sentence says "supported by", but it's under Similar. That may mean that "supported by" in that context is considered a Similar classification. Wait no, that can't be. The user's instructions may have conflicting examples. 

Alternatively, perhaps I should rely on the definitions. The user's Similar class definition says it's about pointing out similarity in results etc., while Support is using the citation to support the authors' work. 

In our problem case, the sentence is "The authors observed... aligns with previous findings @@CITATION@@", which is a straightforward claim that the result is in line with the cited work. 

The primary intent here is to demonstrate that the current result is consistent with prior work, which supports the validity of their current finding. Thus, this is a case of using the citation to support their own result, so Support is the primary. 

Alternatively, Similar is about the similarity itself, so it's a possible secondary choice. The third might be Neutral, but I don't think so, because it's clearly being used to support. The other class could be Basis? If the cited work was foundational to the current study, but here it's just about aligning results, so Basis would not apply. 

The next possible class could be Neutral as a third option? Not quite, because it's an active support. 

Wait, let me see the predefined list again for step 3 possible options. The third could be Support, Similar, or maybe Basis? No. 

Alternatively, maybe the second class is 'Similar' because the alignment shows similarity. 

Third possible is... perhaps 'Basis'? Not really. 

Alternatively, the third might be 'CoCoRes' if they were comparing results? Wait, but here they are not contrasting, just aligning. 

Alternatively, the general intent is Supportive, leading to Support then Similar. 

So the top three would be 1. Support, 2. Similar, and 3. Maybe Neutral? Or another class. Wait but Neutral is when it's just mentioned without any comparison. 

Wait the other possible classes not considered: Basis, CoCoGM, etc. Here it's not comparing with another cited work (it's comparing with their own, but not other cited), so CoCo classes (like CoCoRes) are when comparing with cited and citing papers? 

Wait, in CoCoRes, it's comparing between cited work and citing paper's results. Since they are saying their result aligns (matches) with the cited work's, that is a comparison of results, so CoCoRes's description says "directly compare or contrast the results". So aligning is a comparison? So perhaps the comparison of their results with previous results? So CoCoRes could apply here. Wait but the user's CoCoRes example is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments..." which is a contrast. 

The definition says compare or contrast. So aligning would still be a comparison. 

Wait, so in that case, using the citation as a prior result that their result is compared with (even though it's the same direction), so this could be CoCoRes. 

Hmm, now this complicates things. The citation could be seen as a comparison of results where their results align with cited results. 

So then, the rhetorical classes might include CoCoRes. 

Because in CoCoRes, the author compares their study's results with the cited work. 

Wait that would mean the initial thought of Support or Similar might be incorrect, and instead the correct class is CoCoRes. 

Wait let me read CoCoRes's example again:

"The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets @@CITATION@@", which is contrasting. So comparison (even if not contrasting) would apply. 

So if the citing paper is saying "our results are similar to the cited work", then that is a comparison of results, thus CoCoRes. 

In this case, the user's example for CoCoRes is a contrast, but the definition says "directly compare or contrast results". So comparing similarity would still fall under CoCoRes. 

So then, the first class would be CoCoRes, since it's a direct comparison of the results. 

Support and Similar are other options. So now I need to reassess which is correct.

The problem is the definitions can be a bit ambiguous. Let's re-express:

If the authors say "Our result aligns with previous findings @@CITATION@@", then they are directly comparing their current result to that of the cited work's, stating that they align. That is a comparison of results, so that would be CoCoRes. 

However, the CoCoRes example was a contrast, but the definition includes comparisons as well as contrasts. 

On the other hand, the Support class is when the cited work's findings support the current authors'. So if the cited work's prior finding of reduced bacterial growth (hypothetically) supports that the current method works, then they are providing support for their result.

So this brings two possible interpretations.

But the key is that the Support class is when the cited result is used to support the current one. CoCoRes is comparing their results. Which is primary?

Alternatively, maybe both Support and CoCoRes are applicable. 

Wait in the example given for Support in the instructions, the authors' work is consistent with prior research, which is similar to our case. In that example, the citation is under Support. 

Therefore, the example provided by the user in the Support definition uses the same structure as our problem case. So in that example, the answer is Support. 

Hence, following the user's example, the correct classification would be Support first. 

But according to the definitions, the CoCoRes definition says "directly compare or contrast the results or findings of the cited work with those of the citing paper." 

In our case, the alignment is a comparison of the results. 

Therefore, according to the definition, CoCoRes could apply because they are comparing their results with cited, noting similarity. 

However, the user's example for Support has the same scenario (consistency), and they classified it as Support, so in that case, Support would be correct here. 

Therefore, perhaps the initial thought of Support is correct, and the alternative thought of CoCoRes is conflicting. 

Given that in the Support example from user, which matches our case, the classification is Support, then that's the primary. 

Thus, the top three classes would be: 

1. Support 

Then, since the alignment shows similarity, second could be Similar. 

What's the third? Perhaps Neutral is not. 

Looking again, if there is a case of "aligns with", which also indicates that the cited work and theirs have similar results, maybe Similar is a secondary. 

Alternatively, could there be a Basis? No. 

The third possible could be CoCoRes? But if the first is Support, then second would be CoCoRes? 

Hmm, need to clarify. 

Alternatively, maybe the user's classification example for Support shows that in such cases it is Support, not CoCoRes. 

So following that example's lead, choosing Support as primary, and maybe Similar as secondary. 

Third option might be Basis? No, unless the cited work was foundational. The example here could be Support, similar, and maybe neutral. But Neutral is not applicable here as the citation is clearly used to support. 

Alternatively, maybe CoCoGM or other? 

No. 

Alternatively, perhaps the third option is Neutral? Unlikely. 

Wait the third option could be another: if they are merely stating prior results without judgment, maybe. But I think the correct top three are Support, Similar, then maybe Neutral, but maybe Basis? No. 

Alternatively, maybe the third is CoCoRes, but I think the key is that in the example given by user for Support, it's classified as Support. Therefore here, we should follow same. 

So step 3 ranking: 

Top three would be Support, Similar, then Basis? Or CoCoRes? 

Wait another angle: 

The first step's extracted context is "The authors observed that the application of magnetic treatment significantly reduced bacterial growth in water systems, a result that aligns with previous findings @@CITATION@@." 

Here the citation's purpose is to back up their result by showing prior results are consistent. That is, providing support. So the primary is Support. 

Second, because it's pointing out similarity in results, Similar is possible. But is that a separate class? The Similar class's main point is about similarity between the two papers, so that's a secondary possibility. 

Third, maybe Basis? No. Or possibly CoCoRes, but the user's example would have classified it as Support. 

Alternatively, maybe the third is CoCoRes, because it's a direct comparison, but given that the example uses 'Support', I think Support is primary. 

But the example given by the user for Similar was: "Our finding is supported by cross-taxon investigations... the citation is Similar." Wait no, that example was in the Similar class. Let me check again. 

The user provided for Similar:

Example: “Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxa investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@@.”

Wait in this example, the authors are using a cited study to support their own finding, yet the classification is Similar, which is confusing. The sentence says their finding is supported by the cited work, yet it is classified as Similar. 

Hmm, this indicates that perhaps there's a distinction between when supporting is the main point (Support class) versus pointing out similarity (Similar class). 

But that example uses the exact wording as in our problem scenario, but is classified under Similar. That complicates things. 

Wait the example sentence says, "is supported by recent cross-taxa investigations" but the citation is part of the Similar class. The explanation says Similar is when pointing out similarities. 

Ah, maybe because they're both talking about how insect hosts affect bacterial assemblages. So the citing paper's finding is similar to what the cited work found in another context. 

In this case, their own finding is similar to the cited's, so that's Similar. Whereas the example for Support (the first one I mentioned earlier) says "All subscales were consistent with previous research, particularly that of @@CITATION@@", which is also a similarity but classified as Support. 

So perhaps the difference is when the citation is used to support (to confirm their own result), whereas the other is just stating similarity. Or maybe both classes apply here. 

In our current problem scenario, "aligns with previous findings" is similar in intent to the Similar example's "supported by recent...", yet according to the user's classification that example is Similar. 

This is conflicting. However, following the user's example precisely, the example where prior findings are cited as support for the current result is classified as Support, while the other example (cross-taxa investigations) is classified as Similar. 

Wait no, let me check again. Wait in the user's "Similar" example, their own paper's findings are of "insect hosts affect bacterial assembly", and the cited work (the one in the citation) is about fleas and ticks also showing host effects. So the two studies have similar findings. 

In this case, the authors are citing a study that shows a similar result in another system, hence they're highlighting a similarity between their work and the cited work. 

In our problem's case: 

The current study's result aligns with "previous findings" in the citation. So it's similar to their work. So in that case, the citation is to a previous result which shows the same thing as the current study. 

So that scenario would be Similar, because the similarity is the point (i.e., the citation is to work that has a similar result, showing the finding isn't new but consistent). 

Wait but in the Support example from the user, where they have consistency with previous research, that was classified as Support. 

This inconsistency in the examples is confusing. 

Perhaps I need to strictly apply definitions instead of examples, but the definitions are overlapping.

Alternatively, the key difference between Support and Similar is that Support is when the citing authors are using the prior work to back up their current result, whereas Similar is when they are noting that their results are similar to others without necessarily using it for support.

Wait in the example for Similar by the user, the authors might not be trying to support their findings (like providing evidence), but just stating an observation that other studies found similar things too, highlighting its generality. 

Alternatively, perhaps the difference is in phrasing: "supported by" (Support) vs "similar to" (Similar). 

But in the problem statement, the phrasing is "aligns with", which is like similarity in results. 

Given the user's example where "supported by" is in a Similar classification, I must adhere to their classification. 

Wait, in the example given for "Similar", the example is:

The citation is part of "In fleas and ticks... rodent..." so the citation is part of the work that supports their finding. But the example is classified under Similar, so they consider that citing to show that others have found similar things as Similar. 

Thus, in our problem case, the same structure "result aligns with previous findings" would fall under Similar. 

In that case, the first class would be Similar, then Support, then?

Wait but the user's example for "Support" says "previous research... also using a U.S. sample", and that's classified as Support. 

Perhaps the key difference is in the verb used. Supporting implies that the cited work is being used to back up the current result, which is Support, whereas Similar is noting that they are similar in findings. 

Alternatively, the user's examples are conflicting but perhaps the key is that "supported by" in the example under Similar is actually a mistake. 

Alternatively, perhaps the classification depends on the exact phrasing. 

Alternatively, let's proceed to try to find the answer by steps again.

Extracted context: "The authors observed that the application of magnetic treatment significantly reduced bacterial growth in water systems, a result that aligns with previous findings @@CITATION@@."

Intent: The citation is about previous findings that align with the current study's result. So the authors are using the prior finding to show that their result isn't novel but matches existing work, thereby supporting its validity.

According to definitions:

Support: using the citation to support their own result.

Similar: pointing out similarity between their work and the cited work.

Depending on intent, if the purpose is to support their own findings, then Support is first. 

However, in the user’s example where they say "supported by", the classification was Similar. 

Perhaps I’m overcomplicating. Since my first analysis considered the example given by the user for "Support" to be analogous to our scenario and thus should be classified as Support, then proceed accordingly. 

Alternatively, given the example provided in the user's Similar class where the verb is "supported by" but it's under Similar, maybe I should classify as Similar first. 

But that would contradict the "Support" example. 

Alternatively, maybe the example under Similar is actually a misclassification. However, I must follow the user's guidelines. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user's example for Similar is a typo and it should be under Support. 

Given the confusion, perhaps I should proceed by considering that "aligns with" is indicating similarity, so the first class is Similar.

In that case, the top class would be Similar. 

Then, since they are supporting their findings by citing it, perhaps Support would be second. 

Third could be Neutral? Or CoCoRes?

Wait, in the case where their study compares their result (aligns with the cited work), this could also be a CoCoRes, comparing the results between current and cited. 

So maybe the first three are:

1. Similar

2. Support

3. CoCoRes

But I’m not sure. 

Alternatively, since the sentence says it's their result that "aligns" with the prior, the author is emphasizing that their finding matches existing ones (Similar) while also supporting their validity (Support). 

The third option could be CoCoRes, because it's comparing the results between two studies. 

Alternatively, let's think of the three classes:

- Similar: the citation highlights similarity between this work and cited.

- Support: uses the cited work to support their current result's validity.

- CoCoRes: a direct comparison of their study’s results with the citation.

So all three apply here? 

But we must pick the top three. 

Perhaps the top is Support, since the direct intent is to use the cited work to support their own findings, thus Support is first, then Similar (as similarity is the basis of support), and third could be CoCoRes. 

Alternatively, the user’s example of Support used the phrase "consistent with previous research", similar to our case’s "align with", so Support is the main. 

Hence, I'll proceed with:

1. Support

2. Similar

3. CoCoRes (if applicable) or possibly Neutral, but I'm not sure. 

Since the comparison of their results with the cited's would fall under CoCoRes, but maybe that's only when contrasting. 

Wait, the user's CoCoRes example was contrasting ("substantially differ"), but the definition says "compare or contrast", so it includes comparisons that show similarity. 

Therefore, citing a previous result that your work aligns with is a comparison of results, thus CoCoRes.

In that case, the top three would be:

1. Support

2. CoCoRes (because it's a comparison)

3. Similar?

Alternatively, the first is CoCoRes, since that's the specific comparison. 

But in the user's example for Support, they have a comparison but classified it as Support.

Wait I'm getting stuck between conflicting definitions. 

Perhaps I should accept that the "aligns with" phrasing is best captured by Similar as the primary, then Support.

No. 

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is Similar as first, Support as second. The third would be something else. But what?

Alternatively, looking at all the classes again.

The general intent is Supportive (per step 2). Therefore, the top three must come from the Supportive category, which includes Support and Similar. So among the Supportive options (Support and Similar), plus possibly others in the general intent.

But perhaps the third could be Neutral, but that's a different general intent. 

Wait according to step 2's instructions:

The general intent categories include Supportive (Support, Similar), so the top three must be from those. 

Therefore, possible options are Support and Similar. Need a third. 

Wait the general intent is Supportive, so the three must come from Support or Similar. But there are only two options, so perhaps the third could be an alternative? Or maybe the third is CoCoRes from the Comparative category, but that would be if the general intent were comparative. 

Hmm. 

Alternatively, the first three would be:

1. Support

2. Similar

3. Basis?

No. 

Wait, let me think again. 

Another approach:

The sentence is "The authors observed... , a result that aligns with previous findings @@CITATION@@", so the citation is indicating that their observation is consistent with prior work, serving to support its validity. Hence, the primary is Support.

The similarity is inherent in the support, so the first is Support. The second is Similar, since it's a similarity between their work and the cited. The third could be Neutral? No.

Alternatively, the third might be Basis? If the cited work's results are foundational to their current work, but not necessarily.

Alternatively, the top three are Support first, then Similar, then maybe Basis, but no connection.

Alternatively, the third might be Usage? No, because they aren't using a method from the cited work.

Therefore, the three are Support, Similar, and then CoCoRes (if applicable as a comparison of results). 

But since the user's example for Support includes a comparison and is classified as Support, then perhaps the top two are Support and Similar, third is CoCoRes? 

Alternatively, CoCoRes would be if comparing with the cited work and contrasting. Here they are in alignment, so maybe CoCoRes is not applicable. 

Hence, the top three are Support, Similar, and then possibly Basis? Or another.

Alternatively, since it's a comparison resulting in similarity, it's CoCoRes (Comparison of Results). So that's a valid class. 

Thus, I think CoCoRes is a valid third class here because it's comparing their results with the cited's and showing alignment, thus a comparison of results. 

So the three classes would be:

1. Support

2. CoCoRes

3. Similar 

Wait but the user's example of Support includes a comparison, so the ordering might prefer Support over CoCoRes. 

Hmm, this is tough. 

Alternatively, since the main intent is to support the current findings using the cited's results (Support), followed by the similarity (Similar), and third possibly Neutral or another. 

But since I have to pick three, I will proceed with:

1. Support

2. Similar

3. Neutral (but not sure if that's applicable)

Wait, maybe the third isn't necessary. Since step 3 says to provide three from the list, even if one is less confident. 

Alternatively, maybe the third is CoCoGM (comparison of goals/methods), but the context here isn't comparing methods. 

Thus, I'll commit to:

1. Support

2. Similar

3. CoCoRes

Alternatively, since aligning the results is a comparison, perhaps CoCoRes is the first, but given the example, maybe not. 

Given the conflicting thoughts, and the user's example where "supported by" is under Support, I'll go with that. 

Final answer: 

1. Support

2. Similar

3. CoCoRes
</think>

1. Support  
2. Similar  
3. CoCoRes
