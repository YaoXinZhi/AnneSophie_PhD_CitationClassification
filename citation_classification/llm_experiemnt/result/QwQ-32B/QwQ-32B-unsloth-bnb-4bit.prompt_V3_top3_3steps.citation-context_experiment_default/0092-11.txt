Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the top three rhetorical classes for the citation marked @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. First, I should start by looking at the context around the citation. The user mentioned that the citation is discussing the use of magnetic treatment on hard water to prevent calcite scale formation and that prior research showed it was effective but the mechanism wasn't explained yet. So the current work aims to understand that mechanism.

Step 1: Extract the context. The relevant part here is "The explanation of the phenomena is not yet offered and the purpose of this work is to try to understand the mechanism of the beneficial influence of the magnetic treatment." The citation here refers to their previous research which showed the prevention of scale, but the current study is about explaining why it works.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation here is talking about the motivation for their current study because it mentions that since the mechanism isn't known yet, that's why they're doing this research now. So the general intent would fall under "Motivational." 

Now, looking at the specific classes under "Motivational," the options are Motivation and Future. Since the citation is stating a gap (the explanation isn't known, hence current work's purpose), that's Motivation—it's giving the reason why this study was done. 

Next, the predefined classes. The previous work's result is used to justify the current research's necessity. The "Motivation" class is defined as justifying the research by identifying a knowledge gap, which fits here. 

Looking for other possible classes. Is there a comparison here? Not between other studies, just between before and now. The prior work didn't explain the mechanism, so the current is stepping in. That's more Motivation. 

Could it also be Basis? Basis is when it's foundational, but here it's pointing out that the current work is an extension due to a gap, not just building on it as foundation. 

Support? No, because the citation isn't supporting the current findings but motivating the need for this study. 

So top three would start with Motivation. 

The second might be Basis? Wait, if the prior study's result is foundational, then maybe? But the main point here is the motivation for this study by pointing out the gap. Basis would be if the current research is building on the previous, but the key word here is "the purpose of this work is" to address the gap. So maybe Motivation is primary, then maybe Basis as a second? Or is there a better option? 

Alternatively, is "Usage" a possibility here? The citation refers to a previous study they did, and using the prior work's findings to motivate their new study. But "Usage" refers to using a method or tool, which isn't the case here. 

Future: suggesting future directions? Not exactly here, since the current study is doing that now. 

So the next possibilities. If there's nothing else obvious, maybe the second and third could be "Basis" as the foundation, but the main intent is motivational. Alternatively, perhaps "Neutral"? Because the citation is just mentioning what was previously done without additional comparison? Wait, no, the context here is about the purpose, so it's more than just mentioning. So Neutral probably isn't right. 

Alternatively, does it fit "CoCoGM or CoCoRes?" But since it's comparing with their own prior work in terms of explaining the mechanism versus just showing the effect, that could be CoCoGM? The current study's method is different because it's trying to explain rather than just showing prevention. So comparing the goals between the previous and current work: yes! 

Wait, so "CoCoGM" is when comparing goals or methods between the cited work and their own. Here, "Our previous research showed... the explanation is not yet offered and the purpose of this work is to ... understand the mechanism." So their current work's goal is different from their cited work's goal. Thus this is a comparison of goals. Hence, CoCoGM would be applicable here. 

So now I have to check between Motivation and CoCoGM. Which is stronger? The example of CoCoGM given was where one method is proposed to "debiase" while the current focuses on showing biases. That's similar—comparing the goals of the cited work with their own. 

In the current example, the cited work (their own previous work) demonstrated the prevention via magnetic fields but not explaining the mechanism, so the current work's goal is different in that aspect. The example given for Motivation is the same structure: "our previous research showed X but the mechanism isn't known, so the purpose is to explain X." So in that case, that example would use "Motivation" as the rhetorical class, which matches the given example. 

Wait, the example given for "Motivation" in the instruction was: "Our previous research @@CITATION@@ has shown that formation of... can be prevented with applied magnetic field. The explanation... is not yet offered and the purpose of this work is to understand." The example in the instructions clearly shows that situation is for Motivation. 

So that's an exact match. So the primary should be Motivation. 

The second could be "Basis"? Because prior work's result (the prevention) is foundational for their current work which is to explain why prevention works. 

Or, since they are contrasting their goals, "CoCoGM" could also be applicable here. 

The question is whether the example given for Motivation uses Motivation, which it does. The citation's intent is to state the motivation for their current work, so the first class is Motivation. 

CoCoGM is also relevant because the current work's goals contrast with the previous one. The "most appropriate" would be Motivation. CoCoGM would be a secondary? Or maybe there's another. 

Wait the predefined options for "Motivational" are Motivation and Future. So in the example given by the user for Motivation, the citation is the previous work cited as the basis for the motivation, so the main class would be Motivation. 

The second possible class: perhaps Basis, since it's foundational to their current research. The prior work showed the effect, and current is explaining why it works; so their prior work is the basis. So Basis could be second. 

Or, is the basis a different case where the cited work is the foundation, like building on it in a way. 

Alternatively, maybe "Support" or "CoCoRes"? 

No, Support is when they support their current finding with the cited work. Here, the previous work's findings are not conflicting or supporting; they're complementary in purpose. 

So the hierarchy would be Motivation (1), CoCoGM (2), and perhaps Basis (3). 

Wait CoCoGM is "Comparison of goals or methods," which would apply here because they have a different goal now than before. 

Alternatively, if the current work's goal is an extension, comparing their current goals with the cited ones (which were to show effectiveness, not the mechanism), so CoCoGM is relevant. 

Alternatively, the primary is Motivation. Then, second would be Basis, and third CoCoGM?

Hmm. 

Alternatively, maybe the citation is cited to Motivate, and also it's the basis (since they rely on that previous work to show there's an effect, hence basis). 

So top three would be:

1. Motivation (because the main intent is to state why this study was done)

2. Basis (since the prior study's work is foundational in showing the effect, so the current is based on that)

3. CoCoGM (comparing the two's goals: prior was to show prevention, current to explain mechanism)

That seems plausible. 

Alternatively, since the citation itself refers to their own work that showed the prevention, which is prior work they are building upon, the Basis is appropriate for the foundation. 

So the three are Motivation, Basis, CoCoGM? The problem is that the user's example for Motivation already includes the prior work as the cited item for Motivation, so that's first. 

Alternatively, maybe the second is Neutral? Because the author is merely citing their prior research's result before moving forward. No, the context isn't neutral—there's a reason highlighted for the current work.

Alternatively, "CoCoXY" is when comparing two cited works with each other. Not applicable here.

Hmm. Let me try to see again the user's own example for Motivation: the example given is exactly this scenario. So that's first.

Basis is also a valid because the cited work's result is what the current research is based on. The current research wouldn't be done without that.

CoCoGM is the comparison of goals between current and previous.

So the top three would be Motivation (1), CoCoGM (2), and Basis (3) perhaps? 

Alternatively, Basis might not be in the top three. Let me check definitions:

Basis: refers to the intellectual foundation, like introducing the IAT and validating it. The current paper here is based on prior work showing the effect, so the mechanism is an extension. That's foundational. So, the cited work provides the basis for the current research. So Basis is one. But the primary intent here is Motivation. 

Alternatively, the example given in Motivation includes the citation as basis for motivation. The example's citation is the basis (foundation) but the main class is Motivation. So maybe Basis is a supplementary class, but not the strongest. 

Alternatively, in that example, the citation's role is to provide motivation because the mechanism wasn't explained, so their current work's motivation is to fill that gap. The basis would be if they are building upon it, but the primary role here is the motivation.

So in the step 3 ranking, the top three would be: 1. Motivation, 2. Basis, 3. CoCoGM. 

Wait, but maybe the comparison of goals (CoCoGM) is a closer fit. Since the current work's goal is different from the cited one's goal. 

The example of CoCoGM was when "complementary" work done differently. Here, the current work is complementary to their own previous work. So CoCoGM could be considered. 

But since the primary intent is that the prior work's result motivated them to do this study, the main category is Motivation, with the comparison of goals as secondary (CoCoGM) and the foundation (Basis) as the third. 

Alternatively, since Motivation and Basis are both applicable, but according to the steps, the first step is to pick general intent, which was motivational, so then looking into the specifics under Motivational which are Motivation and Future. Wait, the predefined for "Motivational" are Motivation or Future. So the user's example for Motivation is exactly this scenario, so the citation is Motivation. But in the example given by the user for the "Basis" class, the citation introduces the intellectual foundation (the IAT), so when the current paper is based on that, they use the same term. 

In our problem's context, the current paper's motivation is derived from the lack of explanation. The citation of their previous study is to state: "we showed X, but we don't know why, so now we study it." That is primarily Motivation. 

CoCoGM comes in because they are contrasting their current goal with the previous work's goal. 

Basis can also be applied here because their current research is built on the foundation that the effect exists. 

So the three best are:

1. Motivation 

2. CoCoGM 

3. Basis 

Alternatively, if Basis is considered the foundational aspect, but the example's own Motivation case includes Basis implicitly but the top class is Motivation. 

Alternatively, maybe Basis is not as relevant because the focus here is on the motivation rather than foundational. 

Hmm, the problem is the example provided for Motivation in the user's instructions includes the Basis as the citation, but the rhetorical class is Motivation, so maybe the primary is Motivation, next could be CoCoGM, then Neutral? 

Wait Neutral is if it's just mentioned without any argumentative purpose. But here it's clearly part of a motivational statement, so Neutral is out. 

The three top would:

1. Motivation (most relevant),

2. Basis (the previous work is foundational to the current study),

3. CoCoGM (comparison of goals between current and cited).

Another angle, perhaps. The citation is about their own previous research, so the author is acknowledging their own prior work as the basis before moving into explaining how they built upon it. So Basis would be one, but the primary is still Motivation. 

Alternatively, the main is Motivation, then two are CoCoGM and Basis. 

So I think the step-by-step answer would have to be:

1. Motivation (primary)

2. Basis (secondary, as the previous study is foundational)

3. CoCoGM (comparison of goals)

Wait, but the question is to output the top three, so maybe order matters. If Motivation is first, then the next two are Basis and CoCoGM. 

Alternatively, could there be another? Let me think again. The problem says to return three, and the user's example (for motivation class) was exactly the situation presented here, so Motivation must be first.

Second is either Basis or CoCoGM. 

The example given for Basis says the citation introduces a validated method. In our case, the prior work's validated prevention might be the basis for the current study's focus on mechanism. So Basis is applicable. 

CoCoGM is because the goals are being compared between cited and current work. 

Thus, the answer would be 1. Motivation, 2. CoCoGM, 3. Basis. 

Alternatively, maybe the Basis comes after Motivation. But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, since the Motivation example explicitly matches, and the example in the instruction for Motivation is exactly this scenario, then the first is Motivation. The second might be CoCoGM because it's explicitly contrasting their current goal with the cited. Third could be usage? Wait, the example also included the citation as the basis. 

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Since the example given by the user's example for Motivation is the same structure, the primary is Motivation. Then the second would CoCoGM as a second class because it's comparing the goals. Third could be Basis because the prior study is the basis for current research. 

Alternatively, in the user's Motivation example, is there comparison of goals? Not explicitly, but in the current case, the goals are different (previous was to show prevention, current to explain mechanism). Therefore, the current is contrasting its own goal with the cited work, so that's CoCoGM. So that's a second. 

Therefore, the three top would be Motivation (1), CoCoGM (2), Basis (3).

1. Motivation  
2. Basis  
3. CoCoGM
