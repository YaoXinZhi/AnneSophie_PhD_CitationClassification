Okay, let me figure out the rhetorical class for this citation. The sentence mentions that the psyllids were collected using a method described in the citation. The key part here is "The psyllids were then collected... brought to the laboratory for further analyses (CITSEG)". The citation here is referring to a previous work that details the method of collection using a mouth aspirator and glass tubes. 

Looking at the classes, the "Usage" class is for when a method, tool, or experimental setup from the cited work is directly used. Since the passage is describing the method they used and citing the previous work, it seems like they are indicating that they used the method described in Tedeschi et al. 2002. 

I should check other possibilities. "Support" is for supporting a claim, but here it's more about the method used. "Basis" would be if the research is founded on that work, but it's just a method here. "Neutral" is possible, but since they're referring to the method, "Usage" fits better. 

Yes, "Usage" is the right choice because they're using the cited work's method in their experiment.
