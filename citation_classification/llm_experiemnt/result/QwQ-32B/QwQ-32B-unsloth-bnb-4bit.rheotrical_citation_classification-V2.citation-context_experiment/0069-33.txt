Okay, I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in this passage. The passage talks about pear decline, a disease caused by a virus that affects pear varieties grafted onto certain rootstocks. The cited works (Blodgett et al., 1963; Shalla et al., 1963; Jensen et al., 1964) are mentioned in the context of explaining that the disease manifests in specific scion-rootstock combinations. 

First, let's look at the sentence structure. The citation is used to state that the disease is observed in certain grafted pear varieties. The surrounding text is providing information about the disease's presentation and its vector (the pear psylla). There's no mention of comparing methods, results, or contrasting with other studies here. It's more of a neutral statement presenting established facts about the disease and its vectors. 

The "Support" class is when the citation backs a claim made by the authors. Here, the authors are stating a fact about the disease's manifestation, and the citation is used to attribute that information to prior works. However, the example for Support mentions aligning with the authors' findings, which isn't exactly the case here. The example for Neutral is a descriptive use without supporting an argument. The citation here is just citing prior work that established the disease's characteristics. Since the passage is introducing the background without comparing or contrasting, the Neutral class might fit. Alternatively, maybe "Basis" if it's foundational? But Basis is when the cited work is the foundation for the current research. The passage is just stating prior findings, not necessarily the foundation of the current study. 

Alternatively, "Usage" if they used a method, but here it's just citing prior research. The Neutral example given is about a historical fact ("since 1975"), and the current citation is similar: stating prior research findings descriptively. The sentence structure here is similar to the Neutral example: "the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 (CITSEG)." The citation here is providing background information without any argumentative stance. 

So the answer should be Neutral.
