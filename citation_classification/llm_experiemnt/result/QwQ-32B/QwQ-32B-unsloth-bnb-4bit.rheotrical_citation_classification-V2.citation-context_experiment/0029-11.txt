Okay, I need to figure out which rhetorical class the citation (CITSEG) falls into here. Let me start by reading the passage again carefully.

The passage says: "Generally, infected trees are characterised by fewer, smaller and leathery leaves, reduced terminal growth, diminished fertility and fruit size and eventually, death of trees." A necrotic phloem ring at the graft union may develop type="bibr" target="#b16">(EPPO 2019;</ref> (CITSEG) . "In Austria, pear decline is widespread <ref type=""bibr"" target=""#b45"">(Steffek et al. 2011</ref>) and causes severe losses in intensive as well as extensive pear orchards."

Hmm, the part with (CITSEG) is in the middle of a sentence that's describing symptoms of infected trees and then mentions specifics about Austria. The citation (EPPO 2019) is cited right before (CITSEG) in the first part about the necrotic phloem ring. Wait, maybe I need to check if the (CITSEG) is actually citing Steffek et al 2011? Or is there more to the original text? Wait, the user wrote the text as: "…graft union may develop type="bibr" target="#b16">(EPPO 2019;</ref> (CITSEG) . "In Austria, pear decline is widespread <ref type=""bibr"" target=""#b45"">(Steffek et al. 2011</ref>)…" 

Wait, maybe the formatting is a bit messed up here. It seems like (CITSEG) is replacing one of the references here. Let me parse this again. The first part: "A necrotic phloem ring at the graft union may develop…" followed by (EPPO 2019; (CITSEG) before the next sentence. Then "In Austria, pear decline is widespread…" citing Steffek et al 2011. 

It looks like two in-text citations here. The first part says "may develop" and lists sources: EPPO 2019 and then (CITSEG). The second part cites only Steffek et al 2011. Since (CITSEG) is the placeholder, I need to see the context around it. 

The sentence with (CITSEG) is providing evidence about the symptoms of the disease and the presence of a necrotic phloem ring. The part stating "A necrotic phloem ring at the graft union may develop" is being supported by the citation (EPPO 2019) and (CITSEG). The next sentence about Austria's situation is from Steffek et al. 

So the (CITSEG) is part of the first citation cluster here. The first part lists two citations (EPPO 2019 and CITSEG) to support the statement about the necrotic phloem ring. So the rhetorical function here is likely to support the description of the symptoms and the ring's occurrence. 

Looking at the classes, Support is when the citation supports or confirms the author's claim. The statement is describing a characteristic (the necrotic phloem ring) and citing sources to back that up, so (CITSEG) would be supporting that claim. 

Another possibility: is (CITSEG) here perhaps pointing out a similar case? But the sentence is just stating a fact, not comparing it to another study. The Support class fits here because they are providing evidence for their description. 

Wait, the second sentence starts with "In Austria…" which is a separate statement citing Steffek et al. but the first part with (CITSEG) is part of the initial symptom description. Since both EPPO 2019 and (CITSEG) are being cited there, and the first part is descriptive, just backing up the symptoms. So Support makes sense here. 

Alternatively, maybe Usage? If they are using the method or something, but the context here isn't about methods. The citation is supporting the assertion that the necrotic ring may develop, so Support is better. 

Therefore the answer should be "Support".
