Okay, let's tackle this citation classification problem. The user provided a passage and wants to know which rhetorical class the citation (CITSEG) falls into. The options are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, Weakness.

Looking at the example text: "In direct PCR or the first amplification of semi-nested PCR, the universal phytoplasma primers P1/ P7" (CITSEG) "were used." The key here is that they're mentioning using specific primers from the cited work. The example given for the "Usage" class is when a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup is directly used. The primers are part of the experimental setup here. 

So, the citation is referring to the primers P1/P7 developed by the cited authors, which the current study is using in their PCR method. That fits the Usage category because they are directly utilizing a method or tool from the cited work. 

Checking other options: Support would be if they were using the citation to back up a claim, but here it's about the method used. Basis is more about foundational theory. Neutral is just descriptive but not in this case since they're actively using the primers. So the best fit is Usage.
