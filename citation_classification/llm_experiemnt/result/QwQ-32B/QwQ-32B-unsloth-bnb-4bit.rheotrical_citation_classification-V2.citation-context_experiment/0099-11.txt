Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants me to classify the citation (CITSEG) in the given passage into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. 

First, I need to understand the context of the citation in the passage. The passage is talking about pear decline symptoms and how they relate to scion varieties. The sentence with (CITSEG) says: "Blodgett and ale (CITSEG) noted that the frequency and severity of pear decline symptoms did not vary with the scion varieties..." Then it contrasts this with another study by Westwood et al. which found different results.

Looking at the rhetorical classes, I need to see which one fits here. The key part here is that the authors are comparing the results of Blodgett et al. with those of Westwood et al. The first study (CITSEG) says the scion varieties don't affect the symptoms, while the other found that Bartlett was more susceptible. 

The options are like CoCoRes, which is for comparing results. The example given for CoCoRes is about differing results between the cited work and the current study, but here it's between two cited works. Wait, the CoCoRes class is specifically for comparing results with the citing paper, but CoCoXY is for comparing two cited studies. Wait no, let me check the definitions again.

Wait, looking back: 

CoCoGM is for comparing goals or methods between cited work and the current paper. 

CoCoRes is comparing results between cited work and the citing paper. 

CoCoXY is when the citation compares two cited studies with each other, not with the citing paper. 

In the example given for CoCoXY: "However, a review of the available literature is rather confusing due to the often contradictory results that were reported. [REF1-REF12]". That is when two cited studies are being contrasted. 

In the given text, the authors are presenting two different findings from two different studies (Blodgett and Westwood). The sentence structure here is pointing out that Blodgett found no variation, while Westwood found variation. So the citation of Blodgett here is part of a comparison between the two studies. However, since the (CITSEG) is only marking Blodgett's citation, and the contrast is with Westwood's, which is another citation. 

Wait, in the sentence with (CITSEG), the first part is Blodgett's result (no variation), and then "On the other hand, Westwood... found that..." So the two are being contrasted. The citation (CITSEG) is part of a comparison between two studies. Since the authors are comparing the results of two cited studies (Blodgett and Westwood), the rhetorical class should be CoCoRes? Wait no. CoCoRes is when comparing the cited work's results with the citing paper's results, whereas CoCoXY is when comparing two cited studies with each other. 

Because here the authors are not contrasting their own results but two prior studies. The sentence is pointing out a discrepancy between Blodgett's findings and Westwood's. The use of "(CITSEG)" here is in the context of comparing two studies' results, so that would be CoCoXY. 

Wait the example for CoCoXY says it's when the citation is used to compare or contrast two cited studies with each other, not with the citing paper. The current paper here is discussing both Blodgett and Westwood, so the (CITSEG) citation (Blodgett) is part of a comparison between the two cited works. Therefore, that would fall under CoCoXY. 

Alternatively, if the sentence was comparing Blodgett's results to the current study's results, it would be CoCoRes. But since they are contrasting two other studies, the correct class would be CoCoXY. 

Wait, the example for CoCoXY is: 

"However, a review of the available literature is rather confusing due to the often contradictory results that were reported. [REF1-REF12]"

Here they are citing multiple references that have contradictory results. In the given problem, the citation in (CITSEG) is part of a sentence that contrasts two studies, so their results are being compared. 

Therefore, the correct class should be CoCoXY. But I need to confirm the exact wording of the classes again. 

Wait CoCoRes says: "Assign this class when the citation is used to directly compare or contrast the results or findings of the cited work with those of the citing paper." 

But here, the comparing is with another cited paper, not the citing paper. So it's between two cited papers, which would be CoCoXY. 

Therefore, the answer should be CoCoXY. 

Wait, but the user's example for CoCoXY is "the often contradictory results that were reported [REF1-REF12]" which refers to multiple studies, but the key is they are comparing each other. 

Another point: The sentence with (CITSEG) mentions Blodgett's study, then immediately contrasts it with Westwood's study. Therefore, this is a direct comparison between the two cited works. Since the (CITSEG) is part of that contrast, then the rhetorical class for (CITSEG) would be CoCoXY. 

Alternatively, maybe the classification is per citation. Since Blodgett’s study is being contrasted with Westwood’s, each is cited to compare their results. Therefore, each gets CoCoXY. 

Alternatively, maybe CoCoRes is used if the study is compared with the current paper's results. Since in the given text the current paper might not be stating their own results here, but just discussing prior work, then it's CoCoXY. 

Hence, I think the correct answer here is CoCoXY.
