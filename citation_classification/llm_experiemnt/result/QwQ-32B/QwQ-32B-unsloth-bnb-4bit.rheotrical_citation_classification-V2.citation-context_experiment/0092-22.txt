Okay, let's tackle this citation classification problem. The user provided a passage, and I need to figure out which rhetorical class the (CITSEG) belongs to. The options are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, Weakness.

First, I need to read the passage carefully. The sentence with (CITSEG) is: "Insect species and seasonal stage of the pear psyllids (winterform, summerform) were determined by aid of a stereomicroscope according to Ossiannilsson (1992) and (CITSEG)." 

So, the key part here is "according to Ossiannilsson (1992) and (CITSEG)". The authors are saying that they used the methods described by Ossiannilsson and the cited work to determine the insect species and their stages. 

Looking at the classes, the Usage category is when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup from the cited work that is directly used in the current study. That seems to fit here because they're mentioning a method (using a stereomicroscope according to the cited sources) that they actually employed in their research. 

Is there another possible class? Let's check. Support would be if they're using the citation to back up a claim, but here it's more about the method they used. Similar is about pointing out similarities, which doesn't apply here. Neutral is just a descriptive mention, but since they're using the method, it's more active than neutral. 

So, the most appropriate class here is Usage.
