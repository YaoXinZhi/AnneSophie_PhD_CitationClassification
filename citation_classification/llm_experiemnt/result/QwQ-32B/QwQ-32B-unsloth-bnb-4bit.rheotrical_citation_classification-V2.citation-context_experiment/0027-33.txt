Okay, let's tackle this citation classification problem. The user provided a passage and wants me to determine the rhetorical class for the citation marked as (CITSEG). The options are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, Weakness.

First, I'll read the passage carefully. The sentence with (CITSEG) is:

"Liberibacter solanacearum also affects plants from the family Apiaceae such as celery (Apium graveolens L.) and carrot in Europe, Africa and the Middle East type=""bibr"">(Munyaneza et al. 2010a;</ref> type=""bibr"">2015;</ref> type=""bibr"">Alfaro-Fern√°ndez et al. 2012a;</ref> type=""bibr"">2012b;</ref> type=""bibr"" target=""#b79"">Loiseau et al. 2014;</ref>" (CITSEG) <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">Teresani et al. 2014)</ref>. 

Looking at this, the citations here are listed after mentioning the plants affected by the pathogen. The context states that the pathogen affects certain plants in specific regions, and the citations are likely providing evidence or prior studies that support this statement. The sentence seems to be stating a fact about the distribution and hosts of Liberibacter solanacearum, using the cited works as supporting evidence for those claims. 

The options to consider here are Support or Similar. Support is when the citation backs up a claim made by the authors. In this case, the authors are asserting that the pathogen affects these plants in those regions, and they're citing previous studies to support that statement. The Similar class is when pointing out similarity between cited work and current paper, but here it's more about evidence for the current assertion. 

Checking the example for Support: "All subscales were consistent with previous research, particularly that of (CITSEG) also using a U.S. sample..." which aligns with this case. The authors here are using the cited papers to back up their statement about the pathogen's effects. 

Neutral is another possibility where citations are mentioned neutrally, but in this context, the citations are clearly backing up the statement, so Support is better. There's no comparison here (so not CoCoGM or CoCoRes) nor any mention of the cited work's weaknesses or motivation for current research. 

Thus, the rhetorical class should be Support.
