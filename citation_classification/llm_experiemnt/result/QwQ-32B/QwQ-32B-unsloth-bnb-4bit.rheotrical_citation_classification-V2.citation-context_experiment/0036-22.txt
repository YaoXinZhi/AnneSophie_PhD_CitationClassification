Okay, let me try to work through this. I need to classify the citation in the given passage into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. The text provided is: 

"South Haven' were grown on peach seedlings cv. 'Montclar' (non-infected control, n = 4)." "Additional apple, pear and peach plants were inoculated by grafting of two buds from trees infected with the respective phytoplasma." "Apple trees were infected with a virulent accession (3/6, n = 13) in 2017" (CITSEG) [78][79]. "Pear trees were infected with 'Ca. P. pyri' (PD-W, n = 5) in 2012 (Table 5)."

First, I need to understand the context here. The passage is describing experimental setups where different trees (apple, pear, peach) were infected with phytoplasmas. The citation (CITSEG) is placed right after mentioning that apple trees were infected with a virulent accession in 2017. The references [78][79] are attached to that sentence.

Looking at the rhetorical classes, I need to see which one fits. Let me go through the options:

- **Basis**: If the cited work is foundational to the current research. But here, the citation is about the method of infection in apple trees, maybe?

- **CoCoGM/CoCoRes/CoCoXY**: These are comparisons. The sentence here isn't comparing methods or results with another study, just stating their own method.

- **Future**: Not about future research here.

- **Motivation**: Not justifying why the research is done, but describing the experiment.

- **Neutral**: Just describing a fact without argument. The citation might be supporting the method used.

Wait, the sentence says "Apple trees were infected with a virulent accession (3/6, n = 13) in 2017" (CITSEG). The citation here is probably referring to prior work that describes the method of infection or the virulent accession. If they are using a method from the cited work, maybe **Usage**? Because they might be using a method or dataset from the cited paper.

Alternatively, if the citation is just providing evidence that this accession is virulent, then it would be **Support**. But the sentence structure here is just stating a fact about the experiment setup. "Infected with a virulent accession" might be a statement that the citation supports. Alternatively, they might be citing a source that describes this accession's virulence. 

Wait the example for **Usage**: "The experimental set-up was described in details previously (CITSEG)." So if the citation is referring to a method or procedure used here, then **Usage** makes sense. Here, they are using the method of infecting apple trees with that specific accession, possibly documented in the cited work. So "infected with a virulent accession" might be referencing the source where that accession's characteristics are established. 

Alternatively, **Support**, where the cited work supports the claim that the accession is virulent. But the sentence isn't making an argument, just stating how the infection was done. So the citation could be indicating where that method was previously described. 

Therefore, the most likely class here is **Usage**, because they are using the method or prior work's experimental setup. 

Wait another angle: The sentence ends with the citation right after mentioning the infection method. The citation might be the source where that particular accession was previously used or characterized, so they are citing that as the basis for their method. So that's **Usage**, since they are using a method or tool from the cited work. 

Yes, that makes sense. They used a virulent accession that was previously studied or described in the cited work, so they reference it here. So the citation is pointing to a prior study that established or used this accession, making this a Usage case.
