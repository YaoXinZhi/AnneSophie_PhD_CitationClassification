Okay, let's tackle this citation classification problem. The user provided a passage with a citation marked as (CITSEG), and I need to determine which rhetorical class it fits into from the list given. 

First, I'll read through the passage carefully. The text says:

"Additional apple, pear and peach plants were inoculated by grafting of two buds from trees infected with the respective phytoplasma." "Apple trees were infected with a virulent accession (3/6, n = 13) in 2017" (CITSEG) [78][79]. "Pear trees were infected with 'Ca. P. pyri' (PD-W, n = 5) in 2012 (Table 5)."

Hmm, the citation (CITSEG) here is referencing the sentence about apple trees being infected in 2017. The sentence structure seems to be stating a method or procedure. The authors are describing how they infected apple trees, and they cite previous work. 

Looking at the rhetorical classes, the Usage category is for when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup used in the current study. That seems possible here because they're talking about infecting trees, which could be a method or experimental setup from prior work. 

Wait, another angle: Could it be Support? If they're using the citation to back up their method's validity. But the sentence isn't presenting results or claims they're supporting; it's more about describing the实验步骤. The example under Usage is about the experimental setup described previously, which matches the context here. They might be referring to a prior study that details the method of infection, so they're using that method here. 

Alternatively, maybe Neutral? But Neutral is when it's just a descriptive use without supporting an argument. But since the citation is for the method used, it's more likely Usage. 

Checking the example for Usage: "The experimental set-up was described in details previously (CITSEG)." That's exactly like this case. Here, the citation is backing the method of infecting apple trees, so they used the method from the cited work. 

I don't see any comparison here (so CoCoGM or CoCoRes not applicable). It's not pointing out a similarity (Similar) or criticizing (Weakness). The citation isn't for motivation or future work either. So the best fit is Usage.
