Okay, I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation (CITSEG) in the given passage. Let me read through the text again carefully.

The passage is talking about different 16Sr groups and their phylogenetic relationships. The sentence with the citation says: “Subgroups 16SrV-A, -C, -D and -E formed a sister group to 16SrV-B (or 16SrV-B + 16SrV-F in 16S tree), which was previously reported as the most divergent lineage with respect to the other groups” (CITSEG). 

So the citing authors are describing a specific phylogenetic arrangement of the subgroups and mention that this was previously reported by the cited work. The key here is that they are pointing out that their current findings align with or are supported by the prior work cited. The phrase "which was previously reported" indicates that the cited study's findings support their current description. 

Looking at the possible classes: Support seems appropriate because the citation is used to back up a claim made in the current paper. The authors are using the cited work as evidence that their observation (the sister group relationship) has been noted before, thus supporting their current findings. 

Let me check other classes to be sure. CoCoRes is comparison of results, but here it's not a comparison; they’re just stating that the prior study reported the same thing. Similar might be if they were saying their results are similar, but the wording here is more about the cited work being the prior report of the same finding. Therefore, Support is the best fit here.
