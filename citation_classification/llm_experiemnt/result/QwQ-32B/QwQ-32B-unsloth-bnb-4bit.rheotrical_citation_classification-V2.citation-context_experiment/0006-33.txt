Alright, let me tackle this citation classification. The user provided a passage with a citation marked as (CITSEG), and I need to figure out which rhetorical class it fits into from the list given. 

First, I'll read through the passage carefully. The part with (CITSEG) is in the sentence: "The psyllids were then collected in glass tubes by means of a mouth aspirator and brought to the laboratory for further analyses (CITSEG)." 

Looking at the surrounding context, the sentence describes the method used to collect the psyllids. They mention using a mouth aspirator and bringing them to the lab. The citation is placed right after this method description. 

Now, I need to check the predefined classes. Let's go through them one by one. 

The "Usage" class is when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup used in the current study. The example given is about an experimental setup described previously. In this case, the citation is right after describing the collection method (using a mouth aspirator), so it might be referring to the method of collection. 

Is there another possible class? Let me think. "Support" is for when the citation supports a claim. Here, it's more about the method they used, not supporting a result. "Basis" is if it's foundational work. "Similar" would be if they're saying their method is similar to another study. "CoCoGM" is comparing methods with another study, but here it's just stating their own method and citing a source for it. 

The example for "Usage" is "The experimental set-up was described in details previously (CITSEG)." That's very similar to this case. They're using a method described in the cited work. So, the citation here is likely referencing a prior work that described this method, which the current study is using. 

Therefore, the correct class should be "Usage".
