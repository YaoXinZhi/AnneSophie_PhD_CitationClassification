Okay, let me try to figure out the rhetorical class for this citation. The passage mentions using two different pairs of ribosomal primers, and one of them is cited with (CITSEG). The context here is about the methods used for analysis. The citation is referring to the specific primers, so it's likely that the cited work is the source where those primers were first described or used. 

Looking at the classes, "Usage" is when a method, tool, dataset, or setup from the cited work is used in the current study. Since the primers are part of the methodology here, and the citation is pointing to the source of those primers, that fits under Usage. 

Wait, but there's another part mentioning Doyle and Doyle's procedure for DNA extraction, which is also a method. The (CITSEG) here is about the primers. The example for Usage is a method, tool, etc. So yeah, using the primers as described in the cited work would be Usage. The citation is indicating that the specific primer pair (fPD/r0 1) was used as per the cited work. So the rhetorical role here is to indicate that they used a method (specific primers) from that study. So the answer should be Usage.
