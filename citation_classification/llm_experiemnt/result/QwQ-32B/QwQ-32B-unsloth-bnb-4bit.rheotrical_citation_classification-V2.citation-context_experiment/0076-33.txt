Okay, I need to figure out the correct rhetorical class for the (CITSEG) in this passage. Let me start by reading the example text again carefully. 

The passage mentions that facultative endosymbionts can make insects less susceptible to various management methods. Then they cite several studies (Oliver et al. 2003, Scarborough et al. 2005, etc.) using the (CITSEG) placeholder. The following sentence states that documenting these endosymbionts helps in informed pest management decisions.

Hmm, so the cited works are being used to support the claim about endosymbionts affecting pest susceptibility. The authors are reinforcing their statement by referencing prior research. The key here is that the citations are providing evidence to back up their assertion. 

Looking at the classes, "Support" is when the citation reinforces the authors' own findings or arguments. Here, the cited studies support the idea that endosymbionts influence insect resistance, which the authors are using to underline the importance of their study. 

Wait, could it be "Basis"? But Basis is when the cited work is the foundation of the current research. The authors here are building on the cited works' findings but not necessarily saying their current work is a direct continuation. 

"CoCoGM" or "CoCoRes" involve comparisons, but there's no comparison here between the cited works and their own study. 

"Neutral" doesn't fit because they are using the citations to support their argument. 

The mention of future research towards the end might suggest "Future," but the citation is specifically backing up the current statement about the effect of endosymbionts, not suggesting future directions. 

Yes, "Support" seems correct because they're using prior studies to confirm their point about the importance of studying these endosymbionts in pest management.
