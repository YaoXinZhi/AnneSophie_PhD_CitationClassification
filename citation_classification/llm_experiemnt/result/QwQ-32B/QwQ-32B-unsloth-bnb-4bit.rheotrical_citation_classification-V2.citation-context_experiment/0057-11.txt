Okay, let's tackle this citation classification problem. The user provided a passage from a scientific article and wants me to classify the rhetorical class of the citation (CITSEG) here. The options are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, Weakness.

Looking at the passage: "RFLP analysis was carried out as described previously type=""bibr"" target=""#b46"">(Lorenz et al., 1995;</ref>" (CITSEG). The key part here is "as described previously" which typically indicates that the authors are using a method that was described in the cited work. 

The example given for the "Usage" class is: "The experimental set-up was described in details previously (CITSEG)." That's almost identical to the structure here. The authors here are saying they used a method that was previously described in the cited paper. 

Other classes to consider: Support would be if they were using the citation to back up a claim, but here it's about method usage. Similar is about pointing out similarities in results, which isn't the case here. Basis is more about foundational work for the research, but here it's a method. Neutral is possible, but "as described previously" is a common phrasing for Usage. So the most fitting class here is Usage.
