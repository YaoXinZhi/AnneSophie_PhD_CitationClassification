Okay, let's tackle this citation classification problem. The task is to determine the rhetorical class of each (CITSEG) in the given passage. The passage is about the mouthpart morphology of C. chinensis and several other species. 

First, I need to read through the provided text carefully. The user mentioned that each citation is marked with (CITSEG), but in the given text, I see multiple citations listed, such as Pollard, 1973; Tavella and Arzone, 1993; etc. Wait, actually, looking at the example given by the user, the citations here might be replaced by (CITSEG) in another context, but in the provided text, the citations are written out explicitly. However, the user's instruction says that each citation is denoted using (CITSEG). Wait, perhaps in the actual input given here, the citations should have been replaced with (CITSEG), but in this case, maybe there's a specific instance where (CITSEG) is present. 

Looking at the provided text, near the end, there's a mention of "C. pyricola" (CITSEG) "and D. citri..." So the (CITSEG) is within the sentence about the stylet fascicle composition.

So the task is to classify that specific (CITSEG) instance. The question is: what's the rhetorical class here?

Looking at the surrounding sentences: The text states that the stylet fascicle of C. chinensis is similar to that of other species like aphids and other psyllids, including C. mali, C. pyricola (CITSEG), and D. citri. The key phrase is "including C. pyricola (CITSEG)", which is part of a list of species with similar structures. Since the text is pointing out that the structure is similar to these other species, the citation here is supporting a similarity between cited works and the current study. 

In the Rhetorical classes, the "Similar" class is used when the citation points out similarities between the cited work and the current paper. The example provided for Similar is about supporting a finding with other studies. Here, the mention of C. pyricola via (CITSEG) is part of the comparison showing similarity, so this should fall under Similar. Alternatively, check if it's CoCoGM or something else. 

Wait, the CoCoGM is for comparing goals or methods, whereas CoCoRes is for comparing results. Here, it's stating similarity in structure, which would be a similarity in results or observations between C. chinensis and other species studied in the cited work. Since the citation of C. pyricola's structure is presented as similar to the current findings, the cited work's findings share a similarity with the current paper, so it's pointing out a similarity in their observations. Thus, the "Similar" class is appropriate here. 

Another possible class is Support, but Support is for when the cited work supports the authors' own findings. In this case, it's more about the similarity between the cited studies and the current one, not necessarily supporting a claim made by the authors here. So "Similar" is the right choice. 

Therefore, the answer is Similar.
