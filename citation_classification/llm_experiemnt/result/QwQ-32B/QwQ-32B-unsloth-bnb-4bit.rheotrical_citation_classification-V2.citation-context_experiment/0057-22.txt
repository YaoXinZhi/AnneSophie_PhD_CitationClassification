Okay, let's tackle this citation classification problem. The user provided a passage from a scientific article and wants me to determine the rhetorical class of the (CITSEG) placeholder. 

First, I need to recall the different rhetorical classes. The key ones here are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, Weakness. 

Looking at the passage, the sentence with (CITSEG) is in the context of describing methods: "RFLP analysis was carried out as described previously (CITSEG)". The surrounding text mentions using specific primers and methods like cloning with a vector system and sequencing services. The phrase "as described previously" suggests that the cited work is being referenced as a prior method or procedure that the current study is using. 

The example for the "Usage" class is when a method or tool from the cited work is directly used. Here, they're using a method described in the cited work for RFLP analysis. The phrase "as described previously" points to the cited study's methodology being utilized in the current study. 

I should check other possibilities. Is this Supporting a claim? Not really, because they are not confirming a result but rather describing their method. It's not a comparison (CoCoGM/CoCoRes) or pointing out similarities. The Neutral class is when it's just a mention without argumentation, but here it's specifically about using a method. 

Therefore, the correct class here is Usage because they're referring to a prior method that they are using in their experiment.
