Okay, I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation marked (CITSEG) in the given text. Let me start by reading the passage carefully.

The passage is about describing various methods used in a study, such as sequence and RFLP analyses. The sentence with (CITSEG) is part of a list of methods and references. The example given for the Usage class mentions citing a method or experimental setup. Here, the citation is referring to a method ("RFLP analysis was carried out as described previously" followed by (CITSEG)). That sounds like they're using a method from the cited work. 

Looking at the classes: Usage is for when a method, tool, dataset, or setup from the cited work is used in the current study. The text says they carried out RFLP analysis as described in the cited work. So the citation is pointing out that they used the method described in the cited paper. 

I should check if any other classes might fit. Support? No, because it's not supporting a claim but describing a method used. Comparison classes don't apply here. It's not pointing out a similarity or weakness. Neutral? Maybe, but the key here is that they are using the method from the cited work, which fits Usage. So the answer is Usage.
