Alright, I need to determine the rhetorical class for the citation marked as (CITSEG) in the given passage. Let's start by reading the passage carefully.

The sentence with (CITSEG) is: "This molecular marker has been widely used for phylogenetic and taxonomic classification of prokaryotes (CITSEG)." 

The key here is understanding why the citation is included here. The sentence states that the 16S rRNA gene is a molecular marker widely used for classification. The citation (CITSEG) is supporting this claim by providing evidence that others have used this marker before. The authors are backing up their choice of using this marker by citing prior work that also used it, which aligns with the "Support" class. 

Let me check the classes again to confirm. The "Support" class is when the citation is used to support or confirm a claim made by the authors. The "Usage" class is when a method or tool from the cited work is used directly, but here it's not about using a method but rather justifying the choice of the molecular marker by citing its prior usage. 

The "Basis" class is about foundational work, but the sentence isn't stating that the cited work is the foundation of their research, just that others have used the marker. "Neutral" might be a possibility if it's just a descriptive mention without argument, but the context here is reinforcing the validity of their method by citing prior support. 

Therefore, the best fit is "Support".
