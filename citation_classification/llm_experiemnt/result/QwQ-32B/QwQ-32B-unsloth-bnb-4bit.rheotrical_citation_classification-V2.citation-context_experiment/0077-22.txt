Okay, let me try to figure out the correct class for this citation. The passage says "This is supported by data from (CITSEG)", which immediately makes me think of the "Support" class because the authors are using the citation to back up their claim. The phrase "supported by data" is a strong indicator that they're reinforcing their own findings with previous work.

Looking at the example for Support, it mentions citing previous research that aligns with the current findings. Here, the current study found a 14% infection rate, and they reference other studies from France, Italy, and Austria which report similar percentages. This is a direct support of their results. 

I should check other classes just to be sure. Could it be Similar? The citation does show similar results, but the key here is the use of "supported," which is more about confirmation rather than just pointing out a similarity. CoCoRes is about comparing results, but here they are not contrasting, just agreeing. The citation is used to strengthen their own findings, so Support fits best. 

Also, the structure "This is supported by data from (CITSEG)" is almost exactly like the Support example given. So yeah, Support is the right choice here.
