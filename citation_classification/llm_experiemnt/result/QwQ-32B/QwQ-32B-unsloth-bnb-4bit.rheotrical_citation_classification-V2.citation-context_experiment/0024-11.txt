Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user wants me to classify the citation in the given passage into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. The task is pretty straightforward once I understand the context. 

Looking at the example text:

"In 1995, groups of 50 individuals of C. pyri were collected from the same infected orchard in July, August and September, respectively, and were then analyzed by PCR." "For the analysis, the two different pairs of ribosomal primers used were: fPD/r0 1" (CITSEG) "and AP3/ AP5 <ref type=""bibr"" target=""#b2"">(Firrao et al., 1994)</ref> respectively." The DNA extraction from insects was according to Doyle and Doyle's procedure (1990).

So the part with (CITSEG) is referring to the first primer pair fPD/r0 1. The sentence says that they used two different primer pairs, one from CITSEG and another from Firrao et al. The key part here is "used were: fPD/r0 1" (CITSEG). 

The question is, what's the rhetorical role of this citation here? Let's check the classes again.

The Usage class is when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or setup used in the current study. In the example given for Usage: "The experimental set-up was described in details previously (CITSEG)." So that's a clear Usage case because they are using a previously described setup.

In the current case, the paper is mentioning that they used specific primers from the cited work. The primers are a method or tool that they are directly utilizing in their analysis. Therefore, this should fall under Usage because they are referencing a method (the primers) that they applied in their study.

Wait, but the sentence says "the two different pairs of ribosomal primers used were: fPD/r0 1 (CITSEG) and AP3/AP5 from another study." So they are directly using the primers from the cited work. That's exactly the Usage class. The citation is stating that they used the primers described in that work. 

No other classes seem to fit here. It's not Support because they aren't supporting a claim with the citation, just stating they used the primers. It's not Comparison or Contrast, so CoCo classes are out. Basis is about foundational work, which isn't the case here. Future, Weakness, Motivation don't apply. Neutral would be if it's just a mention without using it, but here it's clearly about using the primers from the cited study. 

Therefore, the correct answer should be Usage.
