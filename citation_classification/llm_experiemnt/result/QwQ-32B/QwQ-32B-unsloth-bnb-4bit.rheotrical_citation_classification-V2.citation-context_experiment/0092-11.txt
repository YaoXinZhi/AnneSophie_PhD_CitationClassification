Okay, let's tackle this citation classification. The user provided a passage and wants me to determine the rhetorical class for (CITSEG). 

First, I need to understand the context. The sentence says that insect species and seasonal stages were determined using a stereomicroscope according to Ossiannilsson (1992) and (CITSEG). Then they mention that some psyllids were analyzed by PCR.

The key part here is "according to" which usually indicates that the cited work is being followed or used as a method. The authors are describing how they determined the species and stages, so they're referencing a method or procedure from the cited work. 

Looking at the classes, "Usage" is for when a method, tool, or dataset is directly used. Since they're following a method described in the cited work, that fits. 

Checking other options: "Support" would be if they're backing their results with previous findings, but here it's about the method. "Basis" is more about foundational research, not procedural methods. "Motivation" doesn't fit here because they're not justifying why they did the research but how. "Neutral" is possible, but since they're specifically using the method, "Usage" is better.

So the answer should be Usage.
