Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a citation passage in the plant health domain and wants me to classify the reference's rhetorical class. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation tagged @@CITATION@@. The given passage is: 

"In contrast to previous studies focusing on above-ground plant symptoms @@CITATION@@, our research highlights the significant impact of phytoplasma infection on root development, demonstrating that infected roots exhibit stunted growth and reduced nutrient uptake, as observed in our controlled environment trials."

Step 1: Extract the context discussing the citation. The relevant part here is "In contrast to previous studies focusing on above-ground plant symptoms @@CITATION@@,". This sets up a contrast between the cited studies and the current research.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The phrase "In contrast to previous studies" indicates a comparative intent. The current study is contrasting its focus (root development) with the cited studies that looked at above-ground symptoms. 

Now, looking at the comparative subclasses: CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY. 

CoCoGM is about comparing goals or methods. The cited studies' focus is on above-ground symptoms (their goal/method), while the current study is on roots. That seems to fit CoCoGM because they're contrasting the research focus (goal/method). 

CoCoRes would be if they were comparing results. Here, the difference is in what they studied (focus area), not the results themselves. The current study's results are about roots, but the contrast is in the subject of study, not in the outcomes. 

CoCoXY would involve comparing explanations or claims between two cited works, which isn't the case here. The citation is comparing the current work with the cited one's goals/methods. 

So the general intent is Comparative, and the specific class should be CoCoGM.

CoCoGM
