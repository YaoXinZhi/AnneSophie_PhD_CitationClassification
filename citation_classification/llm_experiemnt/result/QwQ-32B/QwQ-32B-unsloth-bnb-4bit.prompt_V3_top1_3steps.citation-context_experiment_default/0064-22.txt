Okay, let me try to work through this step by step. The user provided a citation passage, and I need to classify the rhetorical class of the citation tagged @@CITATION@@. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The given passage is: 

"The recent discovery of phytoplasma strains with varying mobility in host plants has raised questions about their transmission dynamics @@CITATION@@. Our study builds on this by analyzing the role of vector behavior in disease spread." 

Step 1: Extract the context discussing the citation. The relevant part here is "The recent discovery... transmission dynamics @@CITATION@@." So the context is that the citation is about the discovery of phytoplasma strains' mobility and the resulting questions on transmission dynamics.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation is mentioned because it introduced a discovery that the current study is building upon. This seems like foundational work that forms the basis for the current research. The mention here is to establish the foundation that the current study is extending. 

Now, looking at the predefined classes: 

The options under the general intent "Foundational" is Basis. The definition for Basis says it's when the citation references the intellectual foundation. The example given is about replicating previous work. Here, the current study is building on the discovery mentioned in the citation, so it's using the cited work as a foundational basis.

Other possibilities? Let me check if it's Support or Similar. Support is when the citation supports the authors' current findings. Here, it's more about the basis for their research question, not supporting their results. Motivation? Maybe, since it's a knowledge gap mentioned, but the example for Motivation is about identifying a gap. The phrasing here is "builds on this," which suggests it's building upon prior work, so Basis might fit better. 

So, the general intent is Foundational, leading to Basis as the label. Therefore, the final answer should be "Basis".
