Okay, let me start by looking at the user's instructions again. They want me to determine the rhetorical class of a citation in a plant health context. The example given uses the passage about phytoplasma and conflicting results. The citation is tagged as @@CITATION@@ in the text.

First step: extract the context around the citation. The given example is: "Fast multiplication rates and high concentration of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains have been reported in young developing leaves and roots of infected daisy plants (Wei et al., 2004; Saracco et al., 2006), although conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima @@CITATION@@." 

So the context here is talking about two studies (Wei and Saracco) that reported certain findings, but then the citation points to conflicting results in another study on a different phytoplasma in Euphorbia. The key point here is the comparison between the two sets of results.

Next, identify the general intent. Since the citation is contrasting or comparing two studies (the cited work with the ones mentioned before, Wei and Saracco), it's a comparative intent. The predefined comparative categories are CoCoGM (goals/methods), CoCoRes (results), CoCoXY (explanations/claims). 

Looking at the definition for CoCoXY: "the citation is used to compare or contrast two cited studies with each other â€” not with the citing paper." The example given for CoCoXY is almost identical to the context here. The first two studies (Wei and Saracco) show one thing, and then the citation is pointing out conflicting results from another study. The citing paper is mentioning conflicting results between different cited works, not comparing to their own work. So that fits CoCoXY. 

The other options for comparative would be CoCoRes if it were comparing the citing paper's results with the cited one's, but here it's contrasting two cited studies. Therefore, the specific rhetorical class should be CoCoXY.
