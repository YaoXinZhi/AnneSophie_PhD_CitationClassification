Okay, let's start by looking at the passage provided. The citation is tagged as @@CITATION@@, so I need to focus on the context around that. The user provided an example where the task is to assign a rhetorical class to a citation.

First step: Extract the context discussing the citation. The user's example shows a passage about a study where the experimental setup was described elsewhere. The key part here is "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." So the context is that the current study is using a method or setup that was detailed in the cited work.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. Since the current study is referring to a previous description of their experimental setup, this seems like they're using a method or tool from the cited work. The predefined categories for general intent include "Technical â†’ Usage," which would fit here because the citation is about using a method or setup.

Step 3: Choose the specific class. The Usage class is defined as when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup used in the current study. The example given for Usage is almost identical to the provided passage. So the correct label should be Usage.
