Okay, I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in the given context. Let me start by following the steps outlined.

First, I need to extract the context discussing @@CITATION@@ from the backticks. The user provided this passage: 

`Previous studies have shown that certain phytoplasma strains can enhance plant growth when applied as biofertilizers @@CITATION@@. However, these effects are inconsistent across different host plants, which is a limitation noted in agricultural applications. Our research builds on this by investigating the specific conditions under which these phytoplasma strains can be reliably used.` 

So the relevant part here is that the citation is referenced in the context of previous studies showing inconsistent effects of phytoplasma strains as biofertilizers, and the current research is building on this. 

Next, identifying the general intent. The citation is mentioned because the current work is addressing a limitation (inconsistent effects) noted in prior studies. The phrase "Our research builds on this" suggests that the cited work provides a foundation or a basis for the current study. 

The general intent might be Foundational (Basis) because it's building upon prior work. Alternatively, maybe Supportive? Wait, but "builds on this" indicates that the cited work is a foundation. The cited work shows the initial findings, but with a limitation, and the current study is extending it. 

Looking at the definitions, Basis is when it's the intellectual foundation. Here, the cited study introduces the concept that phytoplasma strains can enhance plant growth, which the current work is building upon. The inconsistency is a problem they're addressing, so the citation is providing the basis for their research. 

Alternatively, the part about the limitation (inconsistent effects) might be pointing out a weakness in the cited work, but the key phrase here is "Our research builds on this", which is more about using the cited study as a foundation. So Basis seems appropriate here. 

The step 3 definitions: Basis is when the citation introduced a concept that the current paper is replicating or extending. Since the current study is building on the cited work's findings (even with its limitations), the cited work is foundational. 

So the rhetorical class should be Basis.
