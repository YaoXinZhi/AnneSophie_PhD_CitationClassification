Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation marked @@CITATION@@. The user provided the passage within backticks, so I should look there. Let me check the passage again:

"Multiple studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of magnetic treatment in inhibiting scale formation in water systems. A key study by Smith et al. @@CITATION@@ showed a 40% reduction in scale when using a 500 Gauss magnetic field. However, our experiments revealed inconsistent results under similar conditions, suggesting possible variables not accounted for in the original study."

Step 1: Extract the context discussing the citation. The relevant part here is: "A key study by Smith et al. @@CITATION@@ showed a 40% reduction in scale when using a 500 Gauss magnetic field. However, our experiments revealed inconsistent results under similar conditions, suggesting possible variables not accounted for in the original study."

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation is mentioned as a key study that showed a specific result, but the current study's results are inconsistent. This seems like a comparison of results between the cited work and the current paper. The authors are pointing out discrepancies, so the intent is comparative.

Now, looking at the specific classes: 
- CoCoRes is for comparing results directly. Since the current study's results differ from the cited one, this fits CoCoRes. 
- The other comparison classes like CoCoGM (goals/methods) or CoCoXY (explanations) don't fit here because it's about results. The original study's results are contrasted with theirs.
- The use of "however" and "inconsistent results" indicates a direct comparison of outcomes, so CoCoRes is the right choice.
