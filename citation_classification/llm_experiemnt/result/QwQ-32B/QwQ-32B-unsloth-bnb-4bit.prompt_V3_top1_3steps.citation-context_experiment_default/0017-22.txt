Okay, let me work through this problem step by step. The user provided a task where I need to classify a citation in a scientific article passage into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. The example given is about plant health, but the specific citation here is about the usage of a method in an experiment. 

First, I need to extract the context discussing the citation. The user mentioned that the passage is enclosed in backticks and the citation is tagged as @@CITATION@@. Looking at the provided example, the citation is part of a sentence saying: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." 

Step 1: Extract the relevant context. Here, the sentence directly mentions that the experimental setup was described before in the cited work. That's the key part for understanding why the citation is used here.

Step 2: Determine the general intent. The sentence states that the current study is using a previously described experimental setup. That sounds like they are referencing a method or procedure from the cited work, which would fall under "Technical" intent, leading to the finer-grained class "Usage" as per the definitions.

Step 3: Select the specific class. The example given under "Usage" explicitly matches this scenario: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." The definition for Usage is when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup used in the current study. Since the current study is directly using the setup from the cited work, that's a clear match for "Usage".

I need to make sure there's no confusion with other classes. For instance, "Support" would be if they were supporting a result, but here it's about using the setup, so "Usage" is correct. "Basis" is more about foundational research, but here it's a method. "CoCo" classes don't apply here since it's not a comparison. So the answer should be "Usage".
