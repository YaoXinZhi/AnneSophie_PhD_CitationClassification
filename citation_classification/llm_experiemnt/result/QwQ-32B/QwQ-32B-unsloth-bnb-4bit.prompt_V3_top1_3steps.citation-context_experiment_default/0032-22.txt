Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to look at the user's input and the context provided. The task is to classify the citation's rhetorical class based on the given definitions. 

The context given is: 

"The increased expression of stress-related genes in infected plants highlights a plant defense mechanism similar to that observed in maize @@CITATION@@."

Alright, so the citation is tagged here. The sentence says that the increased expression of stress-related genes in infected plants shows a defense mechanism similar to what's seen in maize, which is referenced by the citation.

Step 1: Extract the context discussing the citation. The relevant part here is "similar to that observed in maize @@CITATION@@." The key words are "similar to."

Step 2: Identify the general intent. Since the main point here is pointing out a similarity between the current study's findings and the cited work (the defense mechanism in their plants vs. maize), the general intent is "Supportive" or maybe "Comparative." Wait, looking at the intents: Supportive includes Similar. Let me check the definitions again. 

The specific classes under Supportive are Support, Similar. The example for Similar is when the cited work and the current paper share similarities in results, phenomena, etc. The sentence here is pointing out that their finding is similar to the one in maize, so that's Similar.

Wait, the general intent for "Similar" is Supportive. So the general intent would be Supportive. Then the specific class is Similar. Let me confirm the definitions again. 

The Similar example is exactly this case: the current finding is similar to another study. So yes, "Similar" is the appropriate label here. The citation is used to indicate that their observation aligns with prior work in maize, highlighting a similarity. So the rhetorical class should be Similar.
