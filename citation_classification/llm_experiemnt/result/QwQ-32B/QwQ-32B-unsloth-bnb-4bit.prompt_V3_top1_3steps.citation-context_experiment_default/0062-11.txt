Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the citation marked with @@CITATION@@. The user provided the passage within backticks, so I should look there. The passage says: "Previous studies @@CITATION@@ have shown that certain plant extracts can inhibit fungal growth, which forms the basis for our investigation into natural antifungal agents."

Step 1: The context here is about previous studies that demonstrated plant extracts inhibit fungal growth, which the current research uses as a foundation. The key phrase is "forms the basis for our investigation".

Step 2: The general intent seems foundational because the cited work is presented as the underlying reason or starting point for the current study. The current research builds upon those prior findings.

Step 3: Looking at the classes, "Basis" is when the citation is the intellectual foundation. The example given for Basis mentions replicating previous work, similar to how here, the cited studies form the basis for the new investigation. So "Basis" is the most appropriate label.
