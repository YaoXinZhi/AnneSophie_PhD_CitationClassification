Okay, let's start by looking at the user's task. They want me to classify a citation in a scientific article passage into one of those specific rhetorical classes. The passage given is about plant health, right?

First, I need to go through the steps provided. The example given had a passage with @@CITATION@@ tags. Since the actual user input isn't shown here, I should think of a generic approach based on the example they gave. Let me recall the example they mentioned where the answer was "CoCoGM". The citation there was comparing methods between two studies.

So step one is extracting the context. Let me imagine a possible scenario. Suppose the passage says something like: "While previous studies used PCR-based methods for detecting pathogens @@CITATION@@, our approach employs next-generation sequencing to achieve higher sensitivity."

Hmm, that context would suggest a comparison of methods. That's probably CoCoGM. But I need to make sure. Step two is identifying the general intent. Here, the intent is comparative because they're contrasting their method with prior work. Step three would then lead to CoCoGM as the specific class.

Another example could be a sentence stating that the results here support earlier findings in the citation. Then, that's a support class. But in the example given, the comparison of goals or methods would be key for CoCoGM.

Alternatively, if the citation says something like "Earlier studies found conflicting results about the efficacy of this treatment @@CITATION@@", then that might be CoCoRes or CoCoXY, depending on whether they're contrasting with their own results or between cited studies.

Wait, the CoCoXY is for comparing two cited studies, not with the citing paper. So if the passage mentions two citations and says their results are conflicting, that's CoCoXY. If it's contrasting their method with their own, that's CoCoGM.

The example given in the CoCoXY is about conflicting reports between two studies. So that's between cited works. CoCoRes is between the current work and cited, like if they say their results differ from the citation's.

So in the step-by-step, first extract the exact part of the passage around the citation. Then see if it's comparing methods (CoCoGM), results (CoCoRes), or other aspects.

Let me think of another one: "The method described by @@CITATION@@ was used in this study with minor modifications." That's Usage. The citation's method is being utilized directly here.

If the passage is "This study addresses the gap identified in @@CITATION@@," that's Motivation since the citation points out a knowledge gap motivating the current work.

"Earlier studies showed similar trends in plant resistance @@CITATION@@, reinforcing our findings." That would be Similar or Support. Support would be if it's backing up their results. Similar if it's noting similarity in results.

"Despite previous claims of effectiveness @@CITATION@@, our results suggest otherwise," that's Weakness as it points out conflicting or criticizing prior work.

"Further research should explore..." as mentioned in @@CITATION@@ would be Future, suggesting a direction based on the citation.

Alright, so the key is to parse the sentence structure around @@CITATION@@ and see the relational intent. The user's task requires strict adherence to the predefined labels, so I must ensure each step is followed precisely.
