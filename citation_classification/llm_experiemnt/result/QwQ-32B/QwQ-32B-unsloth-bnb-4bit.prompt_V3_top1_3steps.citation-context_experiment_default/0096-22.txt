Okay, let me start by carefully reading the problem and the given example.

The task is to classify the citation marked @@CITATION@@ in a scientific article passage into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. The user provided a detailed step-by-step process: first extract the relevant context, identify the general intent, then select the most appropriate specific class.

The example given is about plant health. The citation's context is: "The formation of hard calcite scale on surfaces in contact with hard water has been well documented @@CITATION@@, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study aims to address this gap by investigating the effect of magnetic treatment on water's physiochemical properties."

Let me go through each step.

Step 1: Extract the context around @@CITATION@@. The sentence says that the formation of scale is documented in the citation, but the mechanisms are unclear. The current study addresses that gap. 

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The key here is that the citation is pointing out a knowledge gap ("underlying mechanisms remain unclear") which the current study is addressing. The citation serves to justify why the current research is necessary because prior work has documented the phenomenon but not explained it. This sounds like the "Motivation" category since it's identifying a knowledge gap to motivate the current study.

Looking at the definitions:

- Motivation: justifies the current research by identifying a gap, need, or open question. The example given is similar: previous work showed a phenomenon but didn't explain the mechanism, so the current work's purpose is to understand it.

Step 3: The specific class should be "Motivation". The citation here is used to set up the motivation for the current study by highlighting what's already known (the formation) and what's not (the mechanism), leading to the current research's aim.

I need to ensure there's no better fit. Could it be "Basis" since it's prior work? But Basis is more about foundational work that the current study builds on, like replicating or extending. Here it's more about the gap motivating the study. "Support" would be if they were confirming prior results, but that's not the case here. "Future" is suggesting future directions, but this is the current study's motivation. So yes, Motivation is correct.
