Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in the given passage. Let's start with step one: extracting the context around @@CITATION@@. The user provided the passage in backticks, so I'll look for that.

The passage given is: "The observed increase in root rot prevalence under drought conditions aligns with findings in similar crops, where water stress triggers susceptibility to fungal pathogens @@CITATION@@." 

First, I need to extract the context discussing the citation. The relevant part here is "aligns with findings in similar crops, where water stress triggers susceptibility to fungal pathogens @@CITATION@@", but specifically the part before the citation mentions that their observation aligns with previous findings. 

Next, step two is identifying the general intent. The sentence says their results align with the cited work's findings. So they're supporting their own findings by referencing prior work. That points towards a supportive intent. Now looking at the specific classes under supportive, which are Support or Similar. 

Looking at the definitions: Support is when the citation supports the citing authors' work. Similar is when pointing out a similarity in results, etc. The example for Support is about consistency with previous research, which matches here. The sentence uses "aligns with findings", which directly supports their result by citing prior work. 

So the general intent is Supportive, and the specific class should be Support. Let me check Similar again. Similar is when similarity is noted, but here it's used to support their own finding, so Support is more accurate. The example given for Support is "consistent with previous research...", which is exactly the case here. Therefore, the answer is Support.
