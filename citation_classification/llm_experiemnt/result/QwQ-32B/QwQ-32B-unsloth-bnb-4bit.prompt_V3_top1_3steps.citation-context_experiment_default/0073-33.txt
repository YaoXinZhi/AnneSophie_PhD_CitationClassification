Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. First, I need to extract the context around that citation. The passage is enclosed in backticks, so I'll look there. 

Looking at the example given by the user, the task is to first extract the relevant context. The passage provided is: 

"Previous studies have shown that magnetic field treatment can reduce scale deposition in industrial systems @@CITATION@@, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Our research builds on these findings to explore the molecular changes involved."

Hmm, the citation here is referring to previous studies that demonstrated the effect of magnetic treatment. The sentence says "builds on these findings," which suggests that the cited work is foundational for the current research. The general intent might be foundational, leading to the 'Basis' class. 

Let me check the definitions again. 'Basis' is when the citation is the intellectual foundation. The example given mentions replicating earlier work, which is similar here because the current research is building on the cited studies. 

Alternatively, could it be 'Motivation'? The sentence mentions that the mechanism is unclear, which could motivate the current study. But the key phrase is "builds on these findings," which points to the cited work as the basis. 

So step 1: extract context. The context is the sentence with the citation. Step 2: general intent is foundational. Step 3: so the label should be 'Basis'.
