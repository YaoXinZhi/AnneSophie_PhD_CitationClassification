Okay, let me tackle this step by step. The user provided a scientific article passage with a citation tagged as @@CITATION@@, and I need to classify its rhetorical class.

First, I need to extract the context surrounding the citation. The given passage is: "Previous studies have shown that magnetic treatment can reduce scale formation in hard water systems @@CITATION@@. However, these studies did not address the long-term effects on pipe corrosion. Our research aims to investigate this overlooked aspect." 

So the relevant part here is "Previous studies...CITATION... However, these studies did not address the long-term effects..." 

Next, identify the general intent. The citation is referring to prior work that demonstrated an effect (reducing scale) but points out a gap they didn't cover (long-term corrosion). This seems to highlight a knowledge gap, which would fall under Motivational. The example for Motivation mentions identifying a knowledge gap or need, which fits here. 

Looking at the specific classes, Motivation is for justifying the current research by pointing out a gap. The other options: Support would be if they agreed with the cited work, but here they're pointing out what the prior work lacked. Basis would be if the current work is built on that foundation, but the emphasis is on the gap. So the correct label should be Motivation.
