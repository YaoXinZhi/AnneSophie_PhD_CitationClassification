Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user provided a scientific article passage with a citation tagged @@CITATION@@, and I need to determine the rhetorical class of that citation. 

First, the task says I should extract the context around @@CITATION@@. The given passage is: 

"@@CITATION@@ has demonstrated that the application of magnetic fields can significantly reduce scale formation in industrial water systems. This study builds on their work by investigating the long-term effects of varying magnetic field strengths on different types of mineral deposits."

Alright, so the context here mentions that @@CITATION@@ demonstrated something about magnetic fields reducing scale. Then the current study is building on that work by looking into long-term effects. 

Next step is to identify the general intent. The options are Foundational, Comparative, Motivational, etc. The phrase "builds on their work" suggests that the cited study is foundational to the current research. The current study extends or builds upon what the cited work did. That points towards "Foundational" under the general intent, which corresponds to the "Basis" label. 

Looking at the definitions again: Basis is when the citation references the intellectual foundation. The example given is about replicating previous results, which is similar here because the current study is building on the cited work. 

Looking at other possibilities: Could it be Support? If the cited work supports the current findings, but here it's more about building upon previous work, not just supporting. Support is more about confirming the same results. 

Motivation? Maybe, if it's identifying a need. But here it's explicitly about building on their work, which is foundational. 

Usage? That's about using a method from the cited work, which isn't mentioned here. 

So the best fit here is "Basis" as the specific rhetorical class. The citation is the foundation the current study is building upon.
