Okay, let me tackle this step by step. The user provided a scientific article passage and wants me to classify the citation @@CITATION@@. First, I need to extract the context around the citation.

The passage given is: "However, previous studies have shown that this method has limited efficacy in humid environments @@CITATION@@, prompting our exploration of alternative approaches." 

Step 1: Extract the context discussing the citation. The relevant part here is "previous studies... have limited efficacy in humid environments @@CITATION@@, prompting our exploration..." So the context is about the cited work pointing out the method's ineffectiveness in certain conditions, which leads to the current study's motivation.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. Since the citation is highlighting a limitation of a previous method, which is why the current research is being done, this seems like a motivational intent. The cited work's findings about the method's weakness are the reason for the current study's motivation.

Step 3: Choosing the specific rhetorical class. The options under Motivational are Motivation and Future. Since the citation directly points out a problem (weakness in the method) that motivated the current research, it fits 'Motivation'. The example for Motivation mentions identifying a knowledge gap or need, which aligns here. The Future class is more about suggesting where to go next, which isn't the case here. The citation is the reason for the present study's motivation rather than suggesting future work. Therefore, the correct label should be 'Motivation'.
