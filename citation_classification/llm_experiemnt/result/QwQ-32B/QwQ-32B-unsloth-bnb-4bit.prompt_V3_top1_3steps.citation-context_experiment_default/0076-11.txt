Okay, let me tackle this step by step. First, I need to look at the user's query and the provided context. The task is to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. 

Starting with Step 1: Extracting the context around the citation. The user provided a passage in backticks. The citation is tagged as @@CITATION@@. The passage says: "Previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of magnetic treatment in reducing scale formation in hard water @@CITATION@@. However, the underlying mechanism remains elusive, prompting further research into molecular interactions."

So the relevant context here is that the citation is mentioned in the context of previous studies showing effectiveness, but the mechanism isn't known. The next part mentions prompting more research. 

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation here is pointing out prior work that established effectiveness, but the current study is about the mechanism. The mention of the citation is to highlight a knowledge gap, leading to the current research's purpose. That sounds like motivation, since it's justifying why the current study is needed. 

Looking at the definitions, Motivation is when the citation justifies the research by a knowledge gap or need. The example given for Motivation mentions a previous study showing a result but not explaining the mechanism, similar here. 

Step 3: Choosing the specific class. The options under Motivational are Motivation or Future. But since the citation here is pointing out a gap that's prompting their own research, it's Motivation. Future is more about suggesting where to go next. 

So the final label should be Motivation.
