Okay, let me tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand what's being asked. The task is to classify a citation in a scientific article passage into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. The user provided an example context and the steps to follow.

The given context is within backticks, so I should first extract the relevant part around @@CITATION@@. The passage says: "The presence of the fungus was confirmed through PCR analysis targeting the beta-tubulin gene @@CITATION@@. This method has also been successfully applied in studies of other plant pathogens @@CITATION@@."

Wait, there are two citations here, but the user's instruction specifies to focus on @@CITATION@@. Looking again, the first citation is for the PCR analysis method. The second citation mentions other studies applying the same method. Since the second citation is the one tagged as @@CITATION@@, I need to focus on that part. The context around the second citation says, "This method has also been successfully applied in studies of other plant pathogens @@CITATION@@."

Step 1 is to extract the context discussing the citation. The relevant sentence is about the method being applied in other studies, so the citation supports the validity or common usage of the method here.

Step 2: Determine the general intent. The sentence is saying that the method (PCR targeting beta-tubulin) has been used successfully elsewhere. That's supporting the current method by citing others who used it too. That leans towards Support or Similar. But the options include Support, which is when the citation supports the citing authors' work, or Similar when it points out a similarity between studies.

Wait, the example for Support is when previous research supports their findings. Here, they are using the cited studies to say that others have applied this method successfully, thereby supporting the validity of their own use. So that's Support, because they're backing up their method's effectiveness by citing prior successful applications.

Alternatively, Similar might be if they were saying their results are similar to others, but the context here is about the method's usage being supported by others. So Support is better. 

Looking at the definitions again: Support is when the citation supports the citing authors' work. The example given for Support is when previous research is cited to support consistency. Here, the citation is used to show that the method is validated by others, which supports their own use. Therefore the answer should be Support.
