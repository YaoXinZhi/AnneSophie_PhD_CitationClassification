Okay, I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in the given passage. Let me start by following the steps outlined. 

First, extract the context discussing the citation @@CITATION@@. The passage provided is: 

"The increased susceptibility of tomato plants to bacterial spot disease under high temperatures has been well-documented @@CITATION@@. However, our study goes further by investigating the role of host plant resistance genes under these thermal stress conditions. " 

The key part here is "The increased susceptibility of tomato plants to bacterial spot disease under high temperatures has been well-documented @@CITATION@@." The citation is supporting the statement about the existing documentation of susceptibility. 

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation is used to back up the claim that the susceptibility is well-documented. That sounds like the cited work supports the authors' current statement. The general intent here is "Supportive," which would point towards the Support or Similar classes. 

Looking at the specific definitions:

- Support: the citation supports or confirms the citing authors' work. The example given is similar: "consistent with previous research, particularly that of @@CITATION@@."

In this case, the current paper is building on the established fact cited. Since the citation is presented as backing their premise, it's supporting their current statement. 

Is there any indication of comparison? No, they are not comparing their work's methods or results to the cited study. They are just using it to establish a known fact that their study builds upon. 

Motivation might be a consideration if they were saying "because this happened, we studied further," but the structure here is "this is known, our study does more." So the primary intent is to support the existing background, hence Support. 

Wait, but let me check Similar. Similar is when there's a similarity between the cited and citing work. Here, it's more about the cited work supporting a general fact, not necessarily that their results are similar. 

Usage refers to using a method, which isn't the case here. Weakness is criticism, which isn't here. Basis is about foundational work. The cited study here is establishing prior knowledge, but the example for Basis includes "introduced and validated" something that the current work replicates. Here, the current work is not replicating but extending. So Basis might not be the best fit here. 

Therefore, the most specific class here would be Support because the citation is used to support the existing knowledge the authors are building upon.
