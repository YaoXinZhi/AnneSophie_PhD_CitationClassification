Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand what's being asked. The task is to determine the rhetorical class of a citation within a scientific article passage. The passage provided is about plant health, and the citation in question is tagged as @@CITATION@@. 

The steps given are:

1. Extract the context discussing the citation @@CITATION@@, keeping only the semantic parts necessary to understand the intent.
2. Identify the general intent based on categories like Foundational, Comparative, etc.
3. Assign the specific label from the predefined list.

Looking at the example provided in the user's message, the citation is part of a sentence that compares results between the current work and prior studies. Specifically, the sentence mentions conflicting results between two studies (Wei et al., 2004; Saracco et al., 2006) and the cited work (the @@CITATION@@). The example given under CoCoXY is similar, where conflicting results are noted between two studies. 

So, in this case, the citation is being used to highlight a discrepancy or difference in results between two other studies, not necessarily comparing them to the current work. That would fall under CoCoXY because it's a comparison between two cited studies regarding their explanations or claims, not involving the citing paper directly. 

Let me cross-check the definitions again. CoCoRes is when comparing results with the citing paper, but here the comparison is between the two cited works (Wei and Saracco vs. the other study). The example given for CoCoXY exactly fits this scenario: "although conflicting results were described for..." which points to comparing two cited studies. 

Therefore, the correct label here should be CoCoXY.
