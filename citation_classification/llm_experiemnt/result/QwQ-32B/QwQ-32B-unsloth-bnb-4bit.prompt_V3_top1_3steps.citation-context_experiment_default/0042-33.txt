Okay, let me tackle this step by step. The user provided a scientific article passage with a citation tagged @@CITATION@@, and I need to classify that citation's rhetorical class based on the given definitions. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage says: "However, our results contradict the previous findings of the similar study conducted on the same species, where the application of magnetic treatment resulted in a significant increase in crop yield @@CITATION@@."

Step 1 is to extract the semantic context relevant to the citation. The key part here is "However, our results contradict the previous findings..." which indicates a contrasting result between the current study and the cited one.

Moving to Step 2: Identify the general intent. The sentence is comparing the results of the two studies, showing that they differ. That points towards a comparative intent. The options under comparative are CoCoGM, CoCoRes, or CoCoXY. 

Now, looking at the specific definitions. CoCoRes is for comparing results or findings directly. Since the current study's results contradict the cited work's findings, this is a direct comparison of their results. 

CoCoGM would be about goals or methods, which isn't the case here. CoCoXY involves comparing explanations or claims between the cited studies themselves, not with the citing paper. Here, the citing paper is contrasting its own results with those of the cited study. So CoCoRes is the right category under comparative intent.

Therefore, the final rhetorical class should be CoCoRes.
