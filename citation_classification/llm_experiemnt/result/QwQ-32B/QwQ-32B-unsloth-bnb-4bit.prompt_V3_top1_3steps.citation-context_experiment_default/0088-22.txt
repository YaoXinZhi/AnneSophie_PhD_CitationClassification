Okay, let me try to work through this step by step. The user wants me to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given plant health passage. The first step is to extract the relevant context around the citation. Let me look at the example provided. 

The context here is: “Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@@.”

So the key parts here are "is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations" and "In fleas and ticks..." which references the citation. The main point seems to be that the current study's finding is supported by other studies, which are cited. The citation is being used to back up their own results. 

Moving to Step 2, identifying the general intent. Since the citation is supporting their own findings, the general intent is probably supportive. Then looking at the specific classes under supportive, the options are Support or Similar. 

The example for Support is when the citation supports the citing authors' work. The example given is similar: "supported by previous research, particularly that of @@CITATION@@". In our case, the sentence structure is the same: "is supported by... investigations... @@CITATION@@". So the citation is providing support for their finding.

The Similar class is when pointing out a similarity between cited and citing work, like in the example where both found that hosts affect bacterial assembly. Here, the cited work's investigations support their own, which aligns with Support. 

Therefore, the specific rhetorical class here should be "Support".
