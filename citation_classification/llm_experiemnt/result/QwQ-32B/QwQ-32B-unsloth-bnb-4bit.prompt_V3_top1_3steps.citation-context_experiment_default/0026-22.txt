Okay, I need to classify the citation marked @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific article passage. Let me go through the steps as outlined.

First, extract the context around the citation. The user provided the passage within backticks. Let me find where the citation is mentioned. The example given is: “Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@@.”

Step 1: The context here is discussing their own finding about insect hosts affecting bacterial communities. They mention that this is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations. The citation is then given as an example of such support from other studies on fleas and ticks. The key part is the word "supported," which indicates that the cited work backs up their results.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. Since the citation is used to support their findings, the general intent would be Supportive. Looking at the categories, Support is under Supportive. The other support-related class is 'Similar', but here the example in the definitions for Support is almost identical to the given context. The example for 'Support': "Our finding... is supported by previous research particularly @@CITATION@@". That's exactly the structure here.

Step 3: The specific rhetorical class. The exact wording here is "is supported by recent... investigations... @@CITATION@@", so the citation is providing supporting evidence. The example given for 'Support' matches this scenario. Therefore, the correct label should be 'Support'.
