Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to look at the user's problem. They provided a task where I have to classify a citation in a scientific article based on the context given. The example they have is about plant health, so I should keep that in mind.

The user's instruction is to first extract the context around the citation marked @@CITATION@@. The context here is within backticks. Let me see the example they gave. The passage is: 

`The presence of bacterial pathogens in asymptomatic nursery plants has been reported before @@CITATION@@, highlighting the importance of preemptive检测. However, our study shows that this phenomenon is more widespread than previously thought.` 

Wait, the user provided Chinese characters here for "检测". Maybe that's a typo or they meant to write in English, but I can infer it's about detection. So the relevant context here is that the cited work reported the presence of bacterial pathogens in asymptomatic nursery plants, and the current study is saying this phenomenon is more widespread. 

Step 1 is to extract the context discussing the citation. The key part here is "The presence...has been reported before @@CITATION@@, highlighting the importance..." So the citation is supporting the idea that asymptomatic plants having pathogens is known, but their study shows it's more widespread. 

Step 2 is identifying the general intent. The general intent classification options are like Foundational, Comparative, Motivational, etc. Here, since the current work is comparing their findings (more widespread) with previous work (highlighting importance), maybe it's comparative? Because they're contrasting the extent of the phenomenon. Wait, but the cited work is being used to say that the current study's results are an expansion. The authors here are using the previous study as a basis for their own? Or are they showing a difference from previous results? 

Wait, the sentence says the citation "highlighting the importance of preemptive detection. However, our study shows this is more widespread than previously thought." The "however" indicates that their result (more widespread) contrasts with what was previously reported. But the citation's work already showed that asymptomatic plants have pathogens, so the current study is saying it's even more widespread. 

So maybe this is a comparison of results. The example of CoCoRes is when the results differ. Here, the citing paper's results "substantially differ from" the cited work. Wait, in the example given for CoCoRes, the results differ. Here, the previous work showed that it's a known issue (presence in asymptomatic plants), but the current study shows it's more widespread. So their result differs in the extent. That could be a comparison. 

Alternatively, maybe it's supporting? Because they are using the prior work to back up the importance of detection. Wait, the citation is used to highlight the importance, which motivated their study. However, the main comparison here is that their finding is different. 

Alternatively, the general intent might be Comparative, specifically CoCoRes (comparison of results). Because they are contrasting their results with the previous study's findings. 

The example for Support is when the cited work supports the current finding. Here, the current study's main point is that it's more widespread. The prior study showed that asymptomatic plants have these pathogens, which provides a basis for why this is important, but the current study's difference in extent (more widespread) compares their results. 

Therefore, the general intent would be comparative, leading to CoCoRes. Let me check definitions again: 

CoCoRes is for comparing results with the citing paper. The example mentions "substantially differ from the results of..." 

In the given example, the current study's result is more widespread, so it's different from the earlier reported cases. Therefore, CoCoRes would fit here. 

Alternatively, could it be Support if the previous work supports the importance, but the key part is that they're building on that to show a difference? Hmm. The initial part uses the citation to say that the importance is known, but the "however" is pointing out their result is different. So the citation is first supporting the importance, but the main purpose of citing it here is to compare their new result. 

The rhetorical class should be the specific one. Since step 3's options include CoCoRes for comparing results, that's likely the right one. 

Wait, let me see the Motivation category's example. The example there is using previous work to point out a knowledge gap. But here the main point is comparing their results to previous ones. 

Yes, so I'll go for CoCoRes.
