Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to look at the user's input and figure out what they want. They provided a scientific article citation passage with a reference tagged @@CITATION@@, and they want me to classify that citation's rhetorical class based on the predefined list of options.

Starting with the user's example, the context given is: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." My task is to apply the three-step process outlined. 

Step 1 is to extract the context discussing the citation. The sentence here is straightforward: the authors mention that their experimental setup was described in detail in a previous citation. The key part here is "experimental set-up was described in detail previously"—this is referencing a prior work that detailed the setup they used.

Step 2 is identifying the general intent. The sentence is stating that they are using a method or setup from a previous study. Looking at the intent categories, "Usage" is defined as when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup from the cited work that is directly used in the current study. The example given for Usage is exactly similar to this context, stating "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." So this fits perfectly under "Technical → Usage".

Step 3 requires selecting the specific rhetorical class. Since the context clearly refers to using a previously described experimental setup, the most appropriate label from the list is "Usage". 

I should check the other options to ensure there's no better fit. "Support" is more about supporting results, which isn't the case here. "Basis" would be if it's foundational, but here it's about methodology. "Similar" is about similarities in findings, not methods. So yes, "Usage" is correct.
