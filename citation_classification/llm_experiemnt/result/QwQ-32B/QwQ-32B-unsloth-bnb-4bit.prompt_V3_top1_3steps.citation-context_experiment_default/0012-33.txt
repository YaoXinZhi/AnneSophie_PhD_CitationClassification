Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user provided a scientific article citation passage with a citation tagged as @@CITATION@@, and I need to figure out the rhetorical class for that citation.

First, I need to extract the context around @@CITATION@@. The given passage is: "Previous studies have shown that certain plant pathogens can be managed using microbial antagonists, with @@CITATION@@ demonstrating the effectiveness of Pseudomonas fluorescens strains in suppressing bacterial wilt caused by Ralstonia solanacearum." 

So the context here is talking about previous studies on managing plant pathogens with microbial antagonists. The specific citation mentions that this particular study (the one in @@CITATION@@) demonstrated the effectiveness of Pseudomonas fluorescens against bacterial wilt. 

Next, the general intent. The citation is used to support the current work's assertion that microbial antagonists are effective. The example uses "demonstrating" so it's providing evidence in support of that statement. Looking at the options under general intent, "Supportive" seems likely here because it's backing up the cited work's findings.

Now, looking at the fine-grained classes for Supportive, the options are Support or Similar. The Support class is when the citation supports the citing authors' work. The example for Support is when previous research aligns with the current findings. Here, the citation is directly supporting the effectiveness claim made in the current passage. The Similar class is when the similarity between cited and citing work is noted, but the example here doesn't mention similarity; it's more about confirming the cited result. So Support seems right.

Wait, but the sentence starts with "Previous studies have shown..." and then cites a specific study. The citation is giving a specific example that supports the general statement. That fits with Support, where the cited work's findings are used to back up the current authors' point. The Similar class would be if they said something like "similar to findings in @@CITATION@@", but here it's more about demonstrating effectiveness, which is direct support.

So the final label should be Support.

Support
