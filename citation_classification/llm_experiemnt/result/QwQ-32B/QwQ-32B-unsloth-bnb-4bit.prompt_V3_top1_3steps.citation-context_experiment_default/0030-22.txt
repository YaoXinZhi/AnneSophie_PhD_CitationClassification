Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user provided a task to classify a citation in a scientific article into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. The citation passage given is about a study on phytoplasma multiplication rates in daisy plants versus conflicting results in Euphorbia pulcherrima. 

First, I need to follow the steps outlined. Step 1 is to extract the context around the citation. The relevant part of the passage here mentions conflicting results described by the cited work compared to others like Wei and Saracco. 

Step 2 is to determine the general intent. They mention conflicting results between the cited studies, which suggests they are comparing explanations or findings between two different studies. The key words like "although conflicting results" indicate a comparison between the cited works, not the citing paper's findings directly.

In Step 3, looking at the classes, CoCoXY is for comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies. The example provided in CoCoXY matches here. The citation isn't comparing with the author's results, but contrasting two existing studies. 

So the correct class should be CoCoXY. It's not CoCoRes because it's about explanations or results differing between the cited works, and the citing paper is just pointing out that discrepancy. Motivation or Support doesn't fit either. Therefore, the final label is CoCoXY.
