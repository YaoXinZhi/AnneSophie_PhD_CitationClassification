Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in the given context. The user provided a passage with @@CITATION@@, and I have to go through the steps.

First, I should extract the context around the citation. The passage says: "Previous studies have shown that certain plant pathogens can induce systemic resistance in host plants @@CITATION@@. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this process remain poorly understood."

Step 1: Extract the context discussing the citation. The relevant part here is "Previous studies have shown that certain plant pathogens can induce systemic resistance in host plants @@CITATION@@." The citation is tagging that previous studies part. The next sentence talks about the mechanism being unknown, which might be part of the context but maybe not directly about the citation's intent.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The sentence is mentioning prior research that has shown a certain result (pathogens induce resistance). The citation supports the statement made by the authors here. So the general intent might be supportive. Between Support or Similar? Or maybe Motivation?

Looking at the definitions, Support is when the citation supports the citing authors' work. Here, they are stating a fact from previous studies, which the current work might build on. The next part about mechanisms being unknown could be motivation for their study. But since the question is specifically about the citation's intent here, the citation is cited to back up the claim that pathogens induce resistance. So that's supportive. The "However" part introduces a gap, which might be motivation for their own work, but the citation itself is supporting the established fact.

So the general intent is Supportive. Now looking at the specific classes: Support, Similar. The example for Support is "consistent with previous research, particularly that of @@CITATION@@", similar to this case. The Similar class is when pointing out similarity between cited and citing work, but here it's just supporting a prior result. So the correct label is Support.

Support
