Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand the given citation passage and determine the rhetorical class for the @@CITATION@@.

Starting with Step 1: Extract the context discussing the citation. The user's example passage is within backticks. The passage provided is: "Phytoplasma disease management remains a significant challenge due to their lack of a specific treatment. Studies by @@CITATION@@ highlighted the effectiveness of certain antibiotics in managing symptoms in annual plants, but their application on woody hosts resulted in only temporary relief. Our research builds on these findings to explore long-term solutions."

First, I need to isolate the context that talks about the citation. The sentence mentioning @@CITATION@@ is "Studies by @@CITATION@@ highlighted the effectiveness of certain antibiotics in managing symptoms in annual plants, but their application on woody hosts resulted in only temporary relief." So the context here is that previous studies showed antibiotics work on annual plants but not so well on woody hosts.

Next, Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation is being used to state prior findings. The current research is building on those findings. The example mentions their results (effectiveness in annuals vs. temporary relief in woody), but the citing paper is extending this. This seems to be foundational because the current work is building upon the cited study's results. Alternatively, maybe it's Supportive because they are using the cited work to base their new research. Wait, according to the definitions, Basis is when the current research is replicating or building on. Since they say "Our research builds on these findings", that aligns with Basis. But another thought: The citation is highlighting prior results which the current work is extending. So the intent is foundational? The example for Basis includes replicating previous work. Here, they are building on, which is similar. 

Alternatively, the general intent might be Support, but support is when the cited work backs the current results. Here, the current paper is using the prior work as a basis for their new study. So the general intent is Foundational â†’ Basis.

Step 3: Check the specific class. Basis is for when the cited work is the foundation. The example given for Basis mentions replicating the same purposes. Here, building on their findings to explore long-term solutions implies that the cited work established certain results, and the current work is extending it, which fits Basis. 

Wait, the user's example for Basis says "introduced and validated the IAT" and then the current work replicates that. In the given case, the cited work's findings (antibiotics on annuals vs. woody) are the basis for the new research seeking long-term solutions. So yes, the Basis class is appropriate here. 

Alternatively, maybe Motivation? Motivation is for justifying why the current research is conducted, like filling a gap. Here, the cited work points out that antibiotics work only temporarily on woody hosts, so the current research is motivated to find better solutions. So maybe it's Motivation? 

Wait the sentence says "our research builds on these findings to explore long-term solutions". The "build on" suggests that the cited work's results are foundational for their approach rather than just providing motivation. The basis class seems more about foundational work that they are building upon. Motivation would be more like a gap identified (e.g., since antibiotics only have temporary effect, we need to find better methods). The current phrasing here is "builds on these findings", so Basis is correct. 

Therefore, the label should be Basis.
