Okay, let's start by looking at the user's problem. They want me to classify a citation in a scientific article's passage into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. The example given has a passage about plant health, so I need to focus on that domain.

First step: Extract the context around @@CITATION@@. The provided passage is: "Previous studies have shown that certain plant pathogens exhibit heightened virulence under elevated temperatures @@CITATION@@, yet the molecular mechanisms mediating this phenomenon remain unclear."

So I need to pull out the part discussing the citation. The key part here is "Previous studies have shown that certain plant pathogens exhibit heightened virulence under elevated temperatures @@CITATION@@, yet the molecular mechanisms mediating this phenomenon remain unclear."

Next, identify the general intent. The sentence mentions that previous studies showed something (virulence increase with temperature) but the mechanisms are unclear. The part after the citation points out a knowledge gap. That seems like the authors are using the citation to highlight why their current research is neededâ€”because the mechanisms aren't understood. That aligns with 'Motivational' intent, specifically 'Motivation' since it's pointing out a gap motivating the current study.

Now, checking the definitions. Motivation is for justifying the research by identifying a gap, need, or question. The example given in the context includes a previous study showing something and then stating the purpose of the current work to address an unexplained mechanism. That matches. Other options: Support? No, because it's not confirming their own results. CoCoRes or similar? Not comparing results, more pointing out a gap. So the rhetorical class should be 'Motivation'.
