Okay, let's tackle this classification task. First, I need to follow the steps provided carefully. The user has given an example with a citation in plant health, and we need to determine the rhetorical class for the citation.

Starting with Step 1: Extracting the context around the citation. The citation in question is @@CITATION@@. The given context is: "A study by @@CITATION@@ reported symptoms in chili pepper plants, including yellowing leaves and stunted growth, which align with our current findings under phosphorus deficiency." 

Hmm, so the sentence is saying that the cited study reported specific symptoms in chili peppers, and these align with the current study's findings on phosphorus deficiency. The key points here are that both studies observed similar symptoms.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The context mentions that the current findings "align" with those of the cited work. This suggests they are pointing out a similarity between the two studies' results or observations. 

Looking at the general intent categories, this seems to fall under "Supportive," but let me check the more specific classes. The options under Supportive are Support or Similar. 

The definition for "Similar" says it's when pointing out similarity in results, phenomena, etc. The example for Similar includes a cross-taxon study where similar bacterial assemblages were found. The context here is about symptoms aligning between studies, which fits "Similar." 

"Support" is when the cited work supports or confirms the current authors' work. In this case, it's not just that the cited work supports it, but specifically the alignment (similarity) between the two is emphasized. 

So the general intent is Supportive, and the specific label is Similar.
