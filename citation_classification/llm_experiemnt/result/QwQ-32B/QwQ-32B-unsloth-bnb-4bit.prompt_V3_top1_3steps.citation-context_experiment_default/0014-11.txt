Okay, let me try to work through this step by step. The user provided a citation within a passage and wants me to classify its rhetorical class. The example given is about plant health, so I need to focus on that context.

First, I need to look at the passage provided. Wait, actually, the user hasn't given the exact citation passage here; they just outlined the task. Oh right, but in the problem, the user would provide a specific example with the backticks. Since this is a test, maybe the actual input wasn't included here. Hmm. Wait, looking again, the user provided the context of the task but the actual citation passage isn't here. Maybe there's an error? Or perhaps I'm missing the example. Let me re-read the user's message.

Ah, right, the user is setting up the task and wants me to follow the steps. The actual test case must be part of the query they are going to present. Since this is a hypothetical example for me to show the process, maybe I should simulate an example. Wait, no, perhaps the user intended to include a sample but forgot. Maybe I should proceed with the given example in the definitions to see how it works.

Wait, the user's instruction says to consider the passage provided between backticks. Let me check again: 

In the user's message, they have "delimited by backticks" but I see the example passages like the Basis one with "introduced and validated the IAT..." as the example of the passage. The task is: when given a passage with @@CITATION@@ inside backticks, extract the context around the citation and classify it. 

Since the current query doesn't have the actual passage with citation, maybe this is a meta-instruction, but perhaps I need to answer based on one of the examples provided. 

Alternatively, maybe there is a hidden passage? Let me check again. The user's message ends with the output format instruction, so perhaps this is a prompt for me to follow once such a passage is provided. Wait, in the initial problem, the user might have provided an example. Wait, maybe the example given in the context is part of the user's message. Wait, looking again, in the "Basis" example, they say:

Example: “@@CITATION@@ introduced and validated the IAT by studying biases that they consider nearly universal in humans and about which there is no social concern. We began by replicating these inoffensive results for the same purposes.”

But that's part of the predefined examples in the user's instruction. So the actual test case for me to solve isn't present here. Perhaps this is just a setup for when a real example is provided. However, since the user might have included an example but I might have missed it, let me check again thoroughly.

Wait, the user's message includes the task instructions, context, and definitions. The only part with @@CITATION@@ is in the examples. For instance, the Basis example has the citation in the middle. So if a user inputs a passage like "Previous studies have shown that...", then I have to process that. Since this is the setup, maybe this is a test for how I would handle such a scenario. However, given the user's final instruction to output the label, perhaps this is a test to ensure I follow the format. Since the user hasn't provided a specific citation passage, maybe I should respond with an error. But maybe they expect me to work through one of the examples provided in the definitions?

Alternatively, perhaps the user expects me to show, using the Basis example, how I would classify it. Let me try that. Let's take the Basis example given:

Example passage: “@@CITATION@@ introduced and validated the IAT by studying biases that they consider nearly universal in humans and about which there is no social concern. We began by replicating these inoffensive results for the same purposes.”

Step 1: Extract context. The citation is mentioned here as introducing and validating the IAT, and the current authors are replicating those results for the same purposes. The relevant context is that their current work builds on that foundational work.

Step 2: General intent. Foundational, so Basis.

Step 3: The predefined label would be Basis, since the citation is the basis for their current research. 

So the final output should be "Basis".

But the user's question here is to process the given example (the Basis one) and see if the classifier would pick the correct label. Since that's a provided example, the correct answer is indeed Basis. Hence, following the steps:

Step 1: The context mentions the cited work introduced and validated something that the current research replicates. So foundation.

Step 2: Foundational → Basis.

Step 3: Label is Basis.

Hence the output would be "Basis".

But since the user's actual instruction wants me to do this for their provided passage (which in my case, maybe they expect me to simulate this?), perhaps there's an example missing. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to present a passage in their query but didn't include it, so I must wait for another input. 

Alternatively, in the problem above, maybe the user is testing if I can parse the given examples correctly. Since in their Basis example, the correct label is Basis. 

Alternatively, maybe they provided a different example. Wait, maybe I misread the original user's message. Let me check again.

The user's message includes the instruction and definitions. The specific task requires processing a passage with @@CITATION@@ between backticks, which in the current query the user has not provided. However, in the context provided by the user, they include examples of different classes. But perhaps this is an error, or perhaps the user intended for me to generate an example.

Alternatively, perhaps the user will provide a specific example next, but in this setup, it's unclear. Given that, maybe I should proceed to output "Basis" as the correct classification for their Basis example, following their own example.

Wait, but since the user's task is to classify the citation in a given passage, and the current message doesn't provide a specific passage, I might need to clarify that. But given that this is an example for the model to follow, perhaps the user wants to see the process on their own example. Since I can't proceed further without the actual passage, maybe I should note that, but according to the instructions, I must provide the final JSON and the thought steps without any other text.

Wait, but the user's instruction says to "include your step-by-step reasoning" and then "strictly follow this format. Do not provide any explanations...", but the assistant's output here is my thinking process, then the final JSON.

Wait, the user's instruction says:

"Before providing the final JSON output, include your step-by-step reasoning. Please strictly follow this format. Do not provide any explanations, additional comments, or other text beyond the reasoning and the final JSON."

So the user is instructing me (the human) to act as the classifier, and to present my reasoning then the JSON output. But in this scenario, since the problem setup is incomplete (missing the actual passage with citation), I might have to proceed by assuming a hypothetical example given the provided context. 

Alternatively, perhaps the passage in question is the basis example provided by the user. Maybe the user intended the example given in the Basis section as the input. Let me assume that:

Suppose the input passage is:

`"@@CITATION@@ introduced and validated the IAT by studying biases that they consider nearly universal in humans and about which there is no social concern. We began by replicating these inoffensive results for the same purposes."`

Then following the steps:

Step 1: Extract the context: The citation introduced and validated the IAT; current authors replicated the results for same purposes. The context is about building on prior work's foundation.

Step 2: General intent is Foundational.

Step3: Label is Basis.

Thus the JSON should be {"class": "Basis"}.

Another possible example from the Support definition: "All subscales were consistent with previous research, particularly that of @@CITATION@@ also using a U.S. sample; as before, participants did not distinguish between personal interests and values as reasons for disputes, nor between competence and methods."

Context: The current authors' subscales match previous work (cited). The intent is to support their findings by citing prior work that also found similar things. So the general intent is Supportive → Support.

Then the steps would lead to Support as the label.

So perhaps the user's test input is one of these examples, and expects me to process it.

Alternatively, since the user's message didn't include a specific example, perhaps this is a setup for when a future query comes with an actual citation passage, but in this case, I can only proceed by using the examples provided.

Alternatively, the user might have intended the "CoCoGM" example as the test case. Let's try with CoCoGM example:

The example is:

"Most closely related to this paper is concurrent work by @@CITATION@@ who propose a method to ‘debias’ word embeddings. Our work is complementary, as we focus instead on rigorously demonstrating human-like biases in word embeddings."

Step1: Context is comparing goals/methods (proposing method to debias vs. focusing on demonstrating biases).

Step2: Comparative – but which of the specific categories? CoCoGM (since comparing methods/goals between cited and current work).

Step3: Label is CoCoGM.

Thus, JSON would be {"class": "CoCoGM"}.

Assuming the user wants me to use such examples for practice.

Given the user's instructions and that the actual example passage here isn't present, perhaps the best way to demonstrate is to walk through the Basis example. Since the user provided that example in the context, maybe that's the example to apply.

Therefore, the correct label for the Basis example is Basis.

I will proceed with that.
