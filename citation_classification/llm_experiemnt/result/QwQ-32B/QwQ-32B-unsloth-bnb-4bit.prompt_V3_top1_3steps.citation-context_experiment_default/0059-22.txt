Okay, let me tackle this step by step. First, I need to look at the user's query and the given example. The task is to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in a scientific passage into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. 

The first step is to extract the context around the citation. The user provided the passage within backticks. Let me see what the passage says. It mentions that "the formation of the hard calcite scale... can be successfully prevented with the applied magnetic field. The explanation of the phenomena is not yet offered and the purpose of this work is to try to understand the mechanism..." and cites @@CITATION@@. 

Now, I need to figure out the general intent. The key part here is that the current work is trying to address a gap pointed out by their previous research. The citation is their previous work showing that magnetic fields prevent scaling, but they didn't explain why. Now they're doing this study to understand the mechanism. That sounds like the citation is motivating the current research because it identifies a knowledge gap. 

Looking at the classes, Motivation is when the citation justifies the research by pointing out a gap or need. The example given for Motivation is similar: previous research showed a result but no explanation, so the current work's purpose is to explain it. 

So the general intent is Motivational, and the specific class should be Motivation. Let me check other options. Future is about suggesting future directions, but here it's the current work's motivation. Support or Basis don't fit because they're not building on the cited work's foundation or supporting their results. It's definitely about why they're doing the research now, so Motivation is correct.
