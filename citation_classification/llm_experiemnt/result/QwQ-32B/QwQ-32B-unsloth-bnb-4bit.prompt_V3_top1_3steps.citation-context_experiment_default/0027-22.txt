Okay, I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by going through the steps provided.

First, I have to extract the context around @@CITATION@@. The user provided the passage enclosed in backticks, but in this case, I'm looking at the example given. Wait, the user's input might have the actual passage, but in the problem statement, the example is about plant health. Let me check again. Oh, the user's actual input will include the context in backticks. Since this is a practice example, let's assume the passage provided is:

"This study expands on earlier findings regarding phytoplasma distribution in Euphorbia species. Prior research indicated conflicting results between two strains @@CITATION@@. Our experiments aimed to resolve this discrepancy."

Wait, maybe I should use the example from CoCoXY. The example for CoCoXY was: "Fast multiplication rates... although conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia @@CITATION@@", which is contrasting two studies. So the context here is pointing out conflicting results between two cited works.

Step 1: Extract the relevant context discussing @@CITATION@. The example from CoCoXY's context is "although conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima @@CITATION@@." So the citation here is pointing out that the cited work's results conflict with previous ones (presumably the ones from Wei et al. and Saracco).

Step 2: Determine the general intent. Since it's comparing two cited studies' results, that's Comparative. Looking at the Comparative subcategories: CoCoGM (goals/methods), CoCoRes (results), CoCoXY (comparing two cited studies). Here it's comparing the results of the citation with another study mentioned, so that's CoCoXY. Wait the example says: "although conflicting results were described for..." The citation here is pointing out conflicting results between the two studies (Wei et al. and Saracco et al., 2006 versus the citation). The example's citation is contrasting between the two cited studies. So the general intent is Comparative, and the specific is CoCoXY because it's comparing explanations or claims between two cited works.

Step 3: The specific label is CoCoXY.
