Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a scientific article citation passage, and I need to classify the reference to the cited work using one of the predefined rhetorical classes. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation tagged as @@CITATION@@. The passage given is:

"Although these studies demonstrate the importance of host preferences in disease spread, they do not account for the influence of seasonal temperature changes. Our study builds on this work by incorporating temperature variables, as temperature has been shown to affect both vector behavior and pathogen development @@CITATION@@."

Okay, the context here is about how previous studies didn't account for seasonal temperature changes, but the current study builds on that work by adding temperature variables. The citation is used to support the idea that temperature affects vector behavior and pathogen development. 

Next step is identifying the general intent. The sentence structure seems to be using the citation to justify or back up a point made by the authors. The phrase "as temperature has been shown to affect..." indicates that the cited work provides supporting evidence for the current study's approach. 

Looking at the predefined classes, the general intent here might be supportive. The options under supportive are "Support" or "Similar". "Support" is when the citation supports the citing authors' work. Since the current study is building on previous work and using the cited study as evidence for why temperature matters, that's a supportive role. 

Now, checking the more specific definitions. The "Support" class is when the citation supports the citing authors' work, like confirming their findings or statements. Here, the citation backs up the claim that temperature affects vector and pathogen factors, which justifies the current study's inclusion of temperature variables. Therefore, the specific class should be "Support".
