Alright, let me tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a scientific article citation passage and wants me to classify the reference @@CITATION@@ into one of the predefined rhetorical classes.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation marked with @@CITATION@@. The example given is: "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@@." 

So, the key sentence here is "is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations... @@CITATION@@". The main point is that the current study's findings are supported by the cited work. 

Next, identifying the general intent. Since the citation is used to back up the authors' results, the general intent is likely supportive. Looking at the options under supportive, there's Support and Similar. The example for Support says the citation supports the citing authors' work, whereas Similar points out a similarity between the cited and current work. Here, the wording "supported by" directly indicates that the cited work is backing up their findings, so Support seems appropriate.

Now, checking the definitions again. The Support example is exactly when the citation supports the current work. The Similar example mentions similarity in results or observations. Here, they're saying their finding is supported, which aligns with Support. Therefore, the correct class should be Support.
