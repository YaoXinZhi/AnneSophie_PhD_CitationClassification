Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. 

First, the user has provided a scientific article passage with a citation tagged as @@CITATION@@ and wants me to classify the rhetorical class of that citation. The first step is to extract the context around the citation. The passage given is:

"In a recent study, @@CITATION@@ demonstrated that a plant-derived compound has the potential to inhibit fungal pathogen growth under laboratory conditions. Our field trials, however, revealed significant variability in this effect across different soil types."

Alright, so the context here is discussing a study that showed a plant compound inhibits fungal pathogens in the lab, but the current study's field trials had variable results depending on soil types.

Next, I need to identify the general intent of the citation. The cited work by @@CITATION@@ presented lab results showing the compound's effectiveness. The current paper mentions their own field trials with different outcomes. They are comparing their results (field variability) with the previous lab findings. That sounds like a comparison of results. So the general intent here is comparative.

Looking at the specific rhetorical classes under comparative: CoCoRes is for comparing results. The example given for CoCoRes is when results differ from another study, which matches this scenario. The cited work's lab results are compared to the current study's field trial results which showed variability, so they are contrasting results. Therefore, the specific class should be CoCoRes.
