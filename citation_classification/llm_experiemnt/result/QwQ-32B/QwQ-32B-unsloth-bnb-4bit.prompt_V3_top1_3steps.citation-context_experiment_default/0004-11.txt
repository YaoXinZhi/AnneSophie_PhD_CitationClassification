Okay, let's tackle this classification. The user provided a passage in the plant health domain with a citation marked as @@CITATION@@. The task is to determine the appropriate rhetorical class for that citation based on the context.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The example given was: "Fast multiplication rates and high concentration of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains have been reported in young developing leaves and roots of infected daisy plants (Wei et al., 2004; Saracco et al., 2006), although conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima @@CITATION@@."

So the relevant sentence here is contrasting the findings of different studies. The first part mentions Wei and Saracco's studies reporting certain results, then the citation is introduced with "although conflicting results" from another study on a different phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima. 

Step 2: identify the general intent. The main point is the comparison between the cited works themselves. The current paper is pointing out that the results differ between the studies (Wei, Saracco vs. the cited one here). This seems like a comparative intent because they are comparing two studies' results. 

Looking at the classes, CoCoXY is for comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies. The example given in CoCoXY exactly matches this scenario where two studies are contrasted. Motivation, Support, or Usage don't fit here since it's not about justifying, supporting, or using methods. It's specifically contrasting two studies' findings, so CoCoXY is the right category.
