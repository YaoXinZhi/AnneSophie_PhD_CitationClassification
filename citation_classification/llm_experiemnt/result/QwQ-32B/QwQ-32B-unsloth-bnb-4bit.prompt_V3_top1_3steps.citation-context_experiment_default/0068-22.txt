Okay, let's tackle this classification task. The user provided a citation passage within backticks and wants me to figure out the rhetorical class of the @@CITATION@@ part.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The given example is: 

"In a recent study, researchers observed that a specific phytoplasma strain significantly reduces disease symptoms in infected tomato plants when grown under high light intensity @@CITATION@@. However, this effect was not consistent across all plant varieties, and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear, prompting further investigation into light-regulated phytoplasma-plant interactions."

Step 1: Extract the relevant context. The sentence with the citation mentions that the study observed a specific effect and notes inconsistencies and unclear mechanisms. 

Step 2: Determine the general intent. The citation here is discussing prior research. The current study seems to be building on it because they mention that the effect wasn't consistent and mechanisms are unclear, leading to more research. That sounds like the cited work provides a foundation, but maybe points out a gap? Wait, the example given for Motivation is when the citation identifies a knowledge gap or need, which is exactly what's happening here. The cited study's findings (the effect not being consistent, mechanisms unclear) are prompting further work. So the general intent might be Motivational. Alternatively, the "prompting further investigation" part could be Future direction. Hmm.

Wait, let me check the definitions again. Motivation is used to justify why the current research is being done, like pointing out a knowledge gap. The citation is about prior observations, then the authors say "prompting further investigation". So the citation here is used to highlight that previous work didn't fully resolve the issue, hence motivating their current study. That aligns with Motivation. The Future class would be if the citation suggests where to go next, but here, the citation's own results are leading to the motivation for current work. 

Alternatively, maybe CoCoRes if they are comparing their results with the cited work? No, the current study's results aren't presented here. They are just saying prior work had inconsistent results. The key is that the citation is the basis for why more research is needed, so Motivation seems right. 

Step 3: The Motivation category's example is when the cited work shows a prior finding and the current work is motivated by a gap. So the final label should be "Motivation".
