Okay, let me tackle this step by step. The user provided a task to classify a citation's rhetorical class based on the given context. The citation is tagged as @@CITATION@@ within a scientific passage about plant health. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The user's example passage mentions that the citation is discussing a study where plant extracts were used to control cucumber beetle larvae, but the results were inconsistent with previous studies. The key part here is that the current study's results differ from the cited one.

Moving to step 2: identifying the general intent. Since the passage contrasts the current results with those from @@CITATION@@, the intent is comparative. Now, looking at the finer classes under comparative: CoCoRes is for comparing results. The example given for CoCoRes mentions differences in results between studies, which matches the scenario here.

So, the correct label should be CoCoRes because they are comparing the results directly. The other options like CoCoGM (methods or goals) or CoCoXY (explanations) don't fit as the focus is on differing outcomes. Support or Similar would be if they agreed, but here it's a contrast. Motivation or Future aren't involved, and there's no mention of methods being used (Usage) or criticizing the cited work (Weakness). Neutral is out since there's a clear comparison. 

Therefore, the final answer is CoCoRes.

CoCoRes
