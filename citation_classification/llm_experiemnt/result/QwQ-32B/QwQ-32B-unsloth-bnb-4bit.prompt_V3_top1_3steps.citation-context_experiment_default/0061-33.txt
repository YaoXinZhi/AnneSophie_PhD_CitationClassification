Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. The user provided a task to determine the rhetorical class of a citation marked @@CITATION@@ within a given scientific article passage. The example given is about plant health, so I need to focus on that context.

First, I need to extract the relevant context around the citation. The passage in backticks is: "Previous studies have shown that certain phytoplasma strains exhibit different multiplication rates in host plants @@CITATION@@. However, our findings contradict these observations, as we observed higher concentrations in root tissues compared to leaves in all tested plant species."

Step 1: Extracting the context. The sentence mentions that previous studies showed different rates, but the current findings contradict them. The citation is pointing to those earlier studies. The key part here is the contrast between the previous studies and the current results.

Step 2: Identifying the general intent. Since the citation is being contrasted with the current study's results, this suggests a comparative intent. The mention of contradiction indicates they are comparing results.

Looking at the predefined classes for comparative intent: CoCoGM (goals/methods), CoCoRes (results), CoCoXY (two cited studies compared). Here, the current paper is contrasting its results with those in the citation, so CoCoRes might be the right category. The example given for CoCoRes mentions differing results between present work and cited experiments, which matches here.

Step 3: Selecting the specific class. The example in CoCoRes is: "Our results differ from @@CITATION@@." The user's example says "However, our findings contradict these observations...", which aligns with comparing results. So the correct label should be CoCoRes.
