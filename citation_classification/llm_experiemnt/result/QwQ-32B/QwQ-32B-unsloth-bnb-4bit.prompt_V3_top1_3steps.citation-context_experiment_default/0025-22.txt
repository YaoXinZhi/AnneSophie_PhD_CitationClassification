Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. The user provided a passage, and we need to determine the rhetorical class of the citation @@CITATION@@. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage given is: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@."

Looking at step 1: The context here is the sentence mentioning that the experimental setup was described in detail in the cited work. The key part here is "described in detail previously," which suggests that the current study is using the experimental setup from the cited work.

Step 2: Identifying the general intent. Since the citation is referring to a method or setup that's being used again in the current study, the general intent is likely "Technical," as the cited work's method is being utilized.

Step 3: Now, looking at the specific classes. The "Usage" class is defined as when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup used in the current study. The example given for Usage is exactly a situation where the experimental setup is described in a previous work. 

So, the correct label here should be "Usage" because the citation is pointing out that the current study uses the experimental setup detailed in the cited work.
