Okay, I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in the given passage. Let me start by following the steps outlined.

First, I should extract the context around @@CITATION@@. The user provided the passage within backticks, so I'll look there. The passage says: "However, previous studies have reported inconsistent effects of drought stress on plant growth, with some showing reduced biomass @@CITATION@@ and others no significant changes @@CITATION@@." 

So the context here is discussing that earlier studies have inconsistent results about drought stress effects. The citation is mentioned in the context of "some showing reduced biomass" and others no changes. 

Next, identifying the general intent. Since they are comparing different results from different studies, this looks like a comparative intent. The cited works are being contrasted with each other. 

Looking at the specific classes for comparative: CoCoGM (goals/methods), CoCoRes (results), CoCoXY (explanations or claims). Here, the comparison is about the results (reduced biomass vs no changes). So the general intent is Comparative, and more specifically CoCoRes because it's comparing the results of the cited studies. 

Wait, but the example for CoCoRes mentions comparing with the citing paper's results. The example given was "The results obtained in the present work... differ from @@CITATION@@." Here, the citing paper isn't presenting their own results yet; they're just stating that previous studies have inconsistent findings. 

Hmm, the example for CoCoXY says comparing two cited studies with each other. The user's example for CoCoXY is when two studies are compared, like conflicting results between Wei et al. and Saracco vs another study. In the given passage, the citation is used to point out that different previous studies have different results. So the citation here is being used to show a comparison between studies themselves, not between the citing paper's results and the cited ones. 

Therefore, that would fall under CoCoRes if the comparison is between cited works' results. Wait, but CoCoRes is when comparing with the citing paper's results, or is it between cited works? Let me check definitions again.

Looking back, CoCoRes is when the citation is used to compare the citing paper's results with the cited. CoCoXY is when comparing two cited studies with each other. 

The current example states that previous studies (plural) have inconsistent effects, with some showing X and others Y. The @@CITATION@@ here is probably for each of those studies. But in the task description, the user's example of CoCoXY was when two cited papers are compared, like conflicting results between them. That example had two citations, but in the given problem here, there are two citations, each representing different studies. Wait, but in the user's input here, the citation tags are only on one? Wait, the user's input shows the passage ends with "with some showing reduced biomass @@CITATION@@ and others no significant changes @@CITATION@@", so each citation is a different study. But the question is about assigning the class to the citation marked @@CITATION@@. However, the problem states that the classifier should assign to the citation tagged @@CITATION@@ in the passage. Since there are two @@CITATION@@ here, but maybe the example is using placeholder citations, perhaps each @@CITATION@@ is a placeholder for a cited work. The task says to assign to the citation @@CITATION@@, so perhaps the user's example here would have each citation being part of a comparison between studies. Since the context is discussing that different studies have different results, and each citation is an example of such studies, the comparison is between the cited works themselves. Therefore, the citation is being used to compare two studies, hence CoCoRes? Or CoCoXY?

Wait the definitions: 

CoCoRes: comparing cited work's results with citing paper's results. 

CoCoXY: comparing cited studies with each other. 

Since the current passage is pointing out that different previous studies have differing results, and the citations refer to each of those studies, this is a comparison between the cited works themselves, not with the current paper's results. Therefore, the rhetorical class should be CoCoXY because it's comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies. The example provided for CoCoXY is exactly this case: "Fast multiplication rates... although conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing...", where two citations are compared. In the user's example here, the same structure is used. 

Therefore, the answer should be CoCoXY. 

Wait but the user's given example of CoCoRes compares the present results with the cited. In this case, the present paper isn't presenting their own results here; they're just stating that existing studies disagree. So the comparison is between the cited studies, so CoCoXY. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem here has two separate citations, and each is being contrasted. So each citation is part of the comparison between studies. 

Thus, the correct label is CoCoXY.
