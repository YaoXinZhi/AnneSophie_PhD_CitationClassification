Okay, I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in the given passage. Let me start by following the steps.

First, I need to extract the context around @@CITATION@@. The user provided the passage within backticks. Let me look at that again:

`Previous studies have shown that phytoplasma infection can lead to varying degrees of symptom expression in host plants @@CITATION@@. However, these studies primarily focused on herbaceous hosts, leaving the impact on woody hosts largely unexplored.`

So the relevant part is: "Previous studies have shown that phytoplasma infection can lead to varying degrees of symptom expression in host plants @@CITATION@@. However, these studies primarily focused on herbaceous hosts, leaving the impact on woody hosts largely unexplored."

Step 1: Extract context. The citation is right after the statement about previous studies showing symptom expression in host plants. The next sentence says those studies focused on herbaceous hosts, not woody ones. 

Step 2: Identify general intent. The citation is pointing out that previous research (the cited study) has looked at symptom expression in host plants but mainly in herbaceous hosts. The current paper is addressing the gap by looking at woody hosts. The mention of the citation here seems to highlight that prior work exists but has limitations (only herbaceous), which suggests that the current study is filling a gap. 

Looking at the general intent categories, this might be Motivation (since it's identifying a knowledge gap) or Comparative (if comparing the cited work's focus vs. current study's). Wait, the example for Motivation has the citation being used to identify a knowledge gap. The sentence structure is "previous studies did this, but they only looked hereâ€”leaving our focus area unexplored," which is a classic motivation for the current research. 

Step 3: Now, the specific classes. Motivation is a possibility here. Also, could it be CoCoGM? Let me check definitions again. 

CoCoGM is for comparing goals or methods. Here, the cited work's focus (herbaceous) is contrasted with the current study's focus (woody hosts). That contrast is similar to CoCoGM. Wait, but the example for Motivation is when the citation is used to justify the current research by pointing out a knowledge gap. The example given for Motivation is: "The explanation of the phenomena is not yet offered and the purpose of this work is to try to understand the mechanism..." 

The current example does exactly that. The cited studies show something but have a gap, so the current work is addressing it. That fits Motivation. 

Alternatively, the first part (previous studies showed X @@CITATION@@) might be a Basis? But Basis is about intellectual foundation. The Basis example mentions replicating earlier work. Here, the current work isn't building on the citation as a foundation but pointing out that the citation's focus left something unexplored. 

Motivation would be the right category here. The citation is used to indicate a gap, motivating the current study. 

Wait, but the first part of the sentence: "Previous studies have shown..." with the citation. That part might be stating the basis for existing knowledge, but the motivation comes from the gap. The citation here is part of the previous research that established that symptom expression exists, but since it's only in herbaceous hosts, that's the gap. 

Hmm. So, the citation is supporting the basis of prior work (Basis?), but the key is the contrast in the next sentence. Since the task requires assigning the rhetorical class specifically for the citation. 

Alternatively, since the structure is "Citation is used to highlight that earlier work on herbaceous hosts left the current study's focus area unexplored (woody hosts), so the reason for the current study is to address that gap. Therefore, the citation's role here is to provide the motivation by pointing out an existing gap. 

Thus, the correct class would be Motivation.
