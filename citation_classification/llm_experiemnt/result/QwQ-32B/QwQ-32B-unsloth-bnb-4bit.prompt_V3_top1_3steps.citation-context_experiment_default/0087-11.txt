Okay, let me tackle this classification step by step. First, I need to look at the given passage and understand the context around the citation tagged as @@CITATION@@. The user provided an example where the citation is part of a discussion about phytoplasma studies.

The excerpt says: "Fast multiplication rates and high concentration of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains have been reported in young developing leaves and roots of infected daisy plants (Wei et al., 2004; Saracco et al., 2006), although conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima @@CITATION@@." 

So the context here is comparing different studies. The main point is that while Wei and Saracco found high concentrations in certain parts of daisy plants, another study (the one being cited) reported conflicting results in a different plant, Euphorbia pulcherrima. The key here is the comparison between the findings of the cited work with other cited works, not with the current paper's results. 

Looking at the general intent, this seems like a comparative scenario. The rhetorical classes under comparative are CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY. Since the comparison is between two cited studies (Wei/Saracco vs. the @@CITATION@@ one), not between the current paper and either of them, this points to CoCoXY, which is for comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies. The example given for CoCoXY matches exactly this scenario where conflicting results from different studies are highlighted.
