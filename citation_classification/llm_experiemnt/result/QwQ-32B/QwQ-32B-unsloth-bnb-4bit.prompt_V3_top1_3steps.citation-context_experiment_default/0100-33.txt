Okay, let me try to work through this step by step. The user wants me to determine the rhetorical class for the citation in the given context. First, I need to extract the relevant context around @@CITATION@@. The passage provided is:

"The impact of soil microbial communities on plant disease resistance has been extensively studied, with several key factors identified such as microbiome composition and root exudates. However, the interaction between foliar pathogens and aerial microbial communities remains understudied @@CITATION@@. Our study addresses this gap by analyzing ..."

So the part mentioning the citation is talking about how the interaction between foliar pathogens and aerial microbes is understudied, and the citation is attached to that statement. 

Next, I need to identify the general intent. The sentence points out a gap in the existing research (since it's "understudied") and says "our study addresses this gap". That sounds like the citation is highlighting a knowledge gap that motivated the current research. 

Looking at the predefined intents: Motivational would be the general category here, which can lead to either Motivation or Future. Since the citation is pointing out a gap that the current study is addressing, that fits "Motivation" because it's justifying why the current research is being done. The example for Motivation mentions identifying a knowledge gap, which matches here.

Now checking the specific classes. The example for Motivation is about a previous study showing a phenomenon but not explaining it, leading to the current study's purpose. In the given context, the citation is used to indicate that this area is understudied, which motivates the current study. So the correct label is "Motivation".
