Okay, let's tackle this. The user has provided a query where I need to classify a citation reference in a scientific article related to plant health. The example given is a passage in backticks with the citation tagged as @@CITATION@@. My job is to figure out the rhetorical class of that citation.

First, I need to follow the steps outlined. Step 1 is to extract the context around the citation. The passage says, "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." So the context here is about the experimental setup being described in a prior work.

Moving to Step 2, identifying the general intent. The sentence mentions that the setup was described in detail in the cited work, which sounds like the current study is using that setup. That makes me think about the "Technical" category, which corresponds to Usage. The predefined list says that "Usage" is when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup used in the current study.

In Step 3, checking the specific class. The example for Usage is exactly a case where the experimental setup is referenced from a previous study. The sentence structure matches the example given for Usage: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." So this fits perfectly under Usage. 

I don't see any comparison here, so not CoCoGM or any others. It's not about motivation or supporting a claim, just stating that they used a previously described setup. Definitely the right label is Usage.
