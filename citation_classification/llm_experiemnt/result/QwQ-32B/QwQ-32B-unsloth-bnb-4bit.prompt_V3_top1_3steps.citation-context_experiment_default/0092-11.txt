Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. The user provided a citation passage, and I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@. Let me start by following the given steps.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The user's example passage says: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." 

Step 1: Extract the context. The relevant part here is "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION @@." The key point here is that the current study is referencing a prior work where the experimental setup was detailed. 

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The sentence is stating that the setup they used was described before in the cited work. This sounds like they are referring to a method or procedure that was used in their current study. The general intent here is probably "Technical" since they're using a method from the cited work.

Looking at the predefined classes, the "Usage" class is for when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup used in the current study. The example given for Usage is exactly this scenario: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." Which matches the user's example. 

So, the most appropriate label here should be "Usage".
