Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, the user provided a scientific article passage with a citation marked as @@CITATION@@. My job is to figure out which rhetorical class this citation falls into based on the given definitions. Let me start by following the steps outlined.

**Step 1: Extract the context discussing the citation.**  
The passage given is:  
`Previous studies have shown that magnetic treatment of water can reduce scaling @@CITATION@@. However, the mechanism behind this effect was not well understood. In this work, we investigated the nucleation processes in detail using high-speed microscopy.`  

The relevant part here is "Previous studies have shown that magnetic treatment of water can reduce scaling @@CITATION@@." The citation is attached to the statement about previous studies showing the effect of magnetic treatment. The next sentence mentions that the mechanism wasn't understood, leading to their current investigation.

**Step 2: Identify the general intent.**  
The cited work here is presenting prior research that demonstrated an effect (reducing scaling). The current study builds on that by exploring the mechanism. The general intent seems to be foundational because the current research is based on the prior work's findings. The prior study introduced a validated effect, and now the current team is expanding on it. Alternatively, maybe it's supportive if they're using the prior result as a basis for their own work. Wait, the example for 'Basis' mentions replicating previous results. Here, they're not replicating but building upon. Hmm. The first example for 'Basis' says it's about the intellectual foundation. Since their current work's motivation is to understand the mechanism behind the cited effect, the cited work provides the foundational basis for their research. So the general intent here is likely Foundational â†’ Basis.

**Step 3: Select the specific rhetorical class.**  
Looking at the definitions again:  
- **Basis**: The citation references the intellectual foundation, like a prior validated study. The current work is built on that. In the example, they replicate the inoffensive results. Here, they are investigating why the cited effect happens. The cited work's result is the basis for their current study.  
- 'Motivation' could be a possibility if it's pointing out a knowledge gap (since the mechanism wasn't understood). However, the citation itself is for the prior finding, not explicitly stating a gap. The "however" in the next sentence introduces the gap, but the citation is about the existing result. So the citation's role here is to present the foundational work that the current study is extending. Therefore, the rhetorical class should be **Basis**.
