Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in the given passage. The passage is about plant health, specifically discussing the multiplication of 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains in daisy plants. The citation is tagged @@CITATION@@ here.

First, step one is to extract the relevant context. The original sentence says: "Fast multiplication rates and high concentration of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains have been reported in young developing leaves and roots of infected daisy plants  (Wei et al., 2004; Saracco et al., 2006), although conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima @@CITATION@@."

So the context here is comparing the findings of Wei and Saracco with another study mentioned via @@CITATION@@. The key words are "conflicting results" which suggests a comparison between two studies' results.

Step two is identifying the general intent. Since they're pointing out conflicting results between two cited works, this seems like a comparative intent. Now, looking at the specific classes under comparative: CoCoGM (goals/methods), CoCoRes (results), CoCoXY (explanations/claims). The example provided for CoCoXY mentions conflicting results between two studies, similar to this case where the citation is used to contrast with previous reports. The citation here is comparing two studies' findings, not the citing paper's with others. So CoCoXY seems right.

The example given for CoCoXY is almost identical: comparing Wei and Saracco with the cited work, noting conflicting results. Therefore, the answer should be CoCoXY.

CoCoXY
