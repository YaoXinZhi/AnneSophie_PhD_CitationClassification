Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. First, I need to understand what the task is asking. The user provided a scientific article passage with a citation marked as @@CITATION@@, and I need to classify the rhetorical class of that citation based on the predefined list. The key is to extract the context around the citation, determine its general intent, and then pick the most appropriate label from the list.

The passage given is:

"In the study of plant pathogen interactions, the role of host specificity has long been debated. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of molecular recognition mechanisms, such as those involving receptors on plant cell surfaces @@CITATION@@. These findings suggest that host specificity is not solely determined by the pathogen's virulence factors but also by the plant's ability to recognize and respond to入侵病原体."

Wait, actually, looking again, the user hasn't provided the exact passage with @@CITATION@@ yet. Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check again. Oh, right, the user's input includes the context in the backticks but in the example given here, maybe there's a placeholder. Wait, the user's instruction says "the scientific article passage delimited by backticks" but in the example above, the user's message shows:

"In the study of plant pathogen interactions, the role of host specificity has long been debated. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of molecular recognition mechanisms, such as those involving receptors on plant cell surfaces @@CITATION@@. These findings suggest that host specificity is not solely determined by the pathogen's virulence factors but also by the plant's ability to recognize and respond to入侵病原体."

Wait, perhaps in this example, the citation is right after mentioning "Recent studies have highlighted...". The task is to classify why the citation is used here. Let me process this as per the steps provided.

Step 1: Extract the context discussing the citation. The relevant part here is "Recent studies have highlighted the importance of molecular recognition mechanisms, such as those involving receptors on plant cell surfaces @@CITATION@@. These findings suggest that host specificity...". The citation here is supporting the mention of recent studies' findings about molecular recognition mechanisms. 

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation is backing up the statement about recent studies showing importance of these mechanisms. That sounds like the citation is being used to support the current paper's point. 

Looking at the possible intents, Supportive would lead to 'Support' or 'Similar'. 

Looking at the definitions, Support is when the citation supports the citing authors' work. The example for Support is "All subscales were consistent with previous research, particularly that of @@CITATION@@...", so similar structure here. The citation here is cited as the basis for the mentioned findings, which the current paper is building on or agreeing with, hence Support. 

Alternatively, maybe 'Basis' if it's foundational. But since the citation is about recent studies, which are supporting the current paper's point, it's more of a support than a basis. Basis would be if they're building on a foundational theory.

So the rhetorical class should be Support.
