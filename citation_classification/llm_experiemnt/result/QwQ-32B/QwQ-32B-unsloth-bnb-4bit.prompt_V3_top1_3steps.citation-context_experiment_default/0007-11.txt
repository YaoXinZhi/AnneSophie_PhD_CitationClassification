Okay, let me tackle this classification step by step. The user provided a citation passage and wants me to figure out the rhetorical class of the @@CITATION@@.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage says: "Previous studies have shown that the应用 of magnetic fields can reduce scale formation in hard water systems @@CITATION@@. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear, prompting further investigation."

Step 1: The context here is "Previous studies have shown that the application of magnetic fields can reduce scale formation in hard water systems @@CITATION@@. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear, prompting further investigation." The key part is that the cited work shows that magnetic fields reduce scale, but the mechanism isn't clear, leading to more research.

Step 2: The general intent. The citation is talking about prior work that demonstrated an effect but didn't explain why. The current study is motivated by this gap. The general intent here seems to be Motivational.

Looking at the specific classes under Motivational, the options are Motivation or Future. The example for Motivation is about identifying a knowledge gap. Here, the cited study's results (reducing scale) are known, but the mechanism isn't, which is prompting the current research. That fits "Motivation" because it's pointing out a knowledge gap that this work addresses. The "prompting further investigation" part is the motivation for the current study.

So the specific label here should be "Motivation".
