Okay, let's start by looking at the user's query. They provided a task where I need to classify a citation's rhetorical class. The task involves three main steps: extracting the relevant context around the citation, identifying the general intent, and then selecting the specific class.

The given example is about plant health. The citation in question is tagged @@CITATION@@ in the passage provided. The user wants me to follow the steps they outlined.

First, I need to extract the context discussing that citation. The user's example passage is within backticks. Let me see what the passage says. The passage says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." 

So, the context here is about the results differing from previous experiments. The key part is the comparison of results between the current work and the cited one. 

Step 2 is to identify the general intent. The options are foundational, comparative, motivational, supportive, technical, critical, or descriptive. Here, the context is comparing results directly with the cited work, so the general intent is comparative.

Now, looking into the specific classes under comparative: CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY. Since the comparison is about the results (the results differ), that points to CoCoRes, which is about comparing results or findings. 

The example given for CoCoRes in the definitions is exactly such a case where the results differ from another study. So, the correct label here should be CoCoRes.

No other classes seem to fit here. It's not about methods or goals (so not CoCoGM), nor comparing explanations between two cited works (CoCoXY). The focus is on differing results, making CoCoRes the best fit.
