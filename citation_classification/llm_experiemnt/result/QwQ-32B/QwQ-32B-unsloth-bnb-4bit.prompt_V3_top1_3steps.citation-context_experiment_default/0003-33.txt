Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. The user provided a passage and wants me to determine the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage given is: "Previous studies have shown that magnetic treatment can reduce scale formation in water systems @@CITATION@@. However, the mechanism behind this effect remains unclear, prompting further investigation." 

Step 1: Extracting the relevant context. The sentence with the citation mentions that previous studies showed magnetic treatment reduces scale, but the mechanism isn't clear, leading to more research. The key part here is the citation is referenced for prior findings, but the current study is investigating the mechanism because it's still unclear.

Step 2: Determine the general intent. The citation is pointing out that prior work has established an effect (reducing scale), but there's a gap in understanding why it happens. This seems to fall under Motivational because it's identifying a knowledge gap that motivates the current research. The example for Motivation mentions explaining a phenomenon that wasn't addressed before, which matches hereâ€”since the cited work showed the effect, but the current study is motivated by the need to understand the mechanism.

Step 3: Choosing the specific class. The options under Motivational are Motivation and Future. The example for Motivation is when the citation points out a gap that the current study aims to address. In the given context, the cited work established the effect, but the mechanism remains unclear (a knowledge gap). The current paper is motivated to investigate this gap. So "Motivation" is the appropriate label here, not Future, because the citation is explaining why the current research is necessary now, not suggesting where to go next. "Future" would be more about suggesting directions after the current work, which isn't the case here. 

Therefore, the correct label should be Motivation.
