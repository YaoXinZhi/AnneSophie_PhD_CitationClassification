Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to look at the citation context provided. The user hasn't given the actual citation passage yet, so I'll wait for that. Once the passage comes in, I'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Extract the context around @@CITATION@@. I'll read the surrounding sentences to understand what's being discussed. The key is to find the part where the citation is mentioned and the immediate context that explains why it's cited.

Step 2: Determine the general intent. If the citation is being used to compare methods with another study, that's CoCoGM. If they're talking about the same results but different outcomes, maybe CoCoRes. If it's just supporting their own findings, then Support or Similar. 

Step 3: Pick the specific class based on the definitions. For example, if the passage says something like "Our results differ from @@CITATION@@ who found...", that's probably CoCoRes. If it's pointing out a similar result, then Similar. 

Wait, the user will provide the specific text, so I have to make sure I analyze that correctly. Let me check the example they gave. In the example for CoCoRes, they mention results differing from a previous study. So I need to look for keywords like "similar," "different," "contrasting," etc. 

Another example: if the citation is used to say that a previous study supports their findings, then Support. If it's about future work, then Future. If they're explaining why their study is necessary because a gap exists (Motivation). 

Once I have the exact sentence, I can apply these steps. For instance, if the context is: "Previous studies have shown conflicting results on plant growth with this method @@CITATION@@, which we address here." That might be CoCoGM if comparing goals, or Weakness if pointing out flaws. 

Need to be careful with the definitions. Let me make sure I'm not mixing up the classes. Also, Neutral is when it's just descriptive without any critical or comparative aspect. 

Alright, once the user provides the citation passage, I can apply these steps systematically. Start with extracting context, then check intent categories, then match to the specific label. The key is to avoid overcomplicating and stick to the definitions provided.
