Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user has provided a scientific article passage and wants me to determine the rhetorical class of the citation marked as @@CITATION@@. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation in the passage provided. The user mentions that the example passage is for a plant health study. However, the actual specific example isn't given here. Wait, the user says "in a scientific article citation passage in the plant health domain" but in their example input, maybe there's a missing part? Hmm, perhaps there's a previous input. Wait, looking at the problem again, maybe the user is giving a general instruction here, but in the actual use case, there would be a specific passage with @@CITATION@@. Since I need to simulate this, let's assume the example given below is the actual input they might provide. Wait the user's input is the entire problem setup. Wait, perhaps the user expects me to process a specific passage, but in their input here, maybe the example in Step 3 is the test case? Or perhaps the example given later is another instance. Wait, perhaps I need more context, but since the user's query is this structure, maybe they are providing the instruction, and I need to process a specific example they will input next. But in this case, since the user's prompt is up to the output format, perhaps this is the setup and the example they want me to process is the one here? Let me read the entire user's message again.

Wait no, actually, the user provided a task where, given a passage with @@CITATION@@, I have to classify it. But in their example message here, they might just be providing the setup and example scenarios. Wait, but perhaps they expect me to process the example they have given in the steps. For instance, looking at the example under 'Support' in the definitions, which uses @@CITATION@@, maybe that's the test case here. Wait, let me check the Support example again: "All subscales were consistent with previous research, particularly that of @@CITATION@@ also using a U.S. sample; as before, participants did not distinguish between personal interests and values as reasons for disputes, nor between competence and methods." So the task here is to process such a passage and classify the citation's rhetorical class as Support, for example.

Since the user's current request is to show how the process would work, perhaps the given example in the definition of 'Support' is the test example. So the citation example here is the one from that sentence.

Let me start with the given example's context. The citation is used in the sentence: 

"All subscales were consistent with previous research, particularly that of @@CITATION@@ also using a U.S. sample; as before, participants did not distinguish between personal interests and values as reasons for disputes, nor between competence and methods."

First, step 1 is to extract the context discussing the citation. The relevant part is "All subscales were consistent with previous research, particularly that of @@CITATION@@ also using a U.S. sample; as before..." So the key phrases are that the current study's subscales are consistent with previous research, especially the work cited, which also used a U.S. sample, and participants didn't make certain distinctions, as before (implying the cited study had the same findings).

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The purpose here is to support the current findings by citing prior work that found similar results. The current study's results are consistent with previous research highlighted by the citation. So the general intent is Supportive, so under the support category. The specific rhetorical class should be Support, as per the example.

So the steps lead to the Support label. However, I need to confirm the definitions again to be sure. 

Looking at Support's definition: "the citation is used to support, or confirm the work, result or finding of the citing authors." The example given matches exactly this scenario. The current study's findings are consistent with the cited work. Hence, the class is Support.

Alternatively, could it be Similar? Let me check 'Similar' definition: "the citation is used to point out a similarity between the cited work and the citing paper." The example under Similar is about supporting the finding by noting similarity. But in the support example, the wording is "consistent with previous research", which is explicitly supporting their own findings. So yes, Support is correct here.

Another check: the example given under "Support" in the problem statement is exactly that sentence. Therefore, the answer would be Support.
