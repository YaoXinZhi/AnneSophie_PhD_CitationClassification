Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the citation @@CITATION@@ from the provided passage. The user mentioned the passage is in the plant health domain, so the example given was about phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima. 

Looking at the example for CoCoXY, the passage says: "Fast multiplication rates... have been reported... although conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima @@CITATION@@." Here, the citation is comparing two studies (Wei et al. and Saracco et al.) with another study's conflicting results. The key point here is that the citation is being used to contrast or compare two cited studies themselves, not with the citing paper's work. 

Step 1: The context here is pointing out conflicting results between different studies. The citation is part of that comparison between the studies mentioned (Wei et al., Saracco et al., and the cited one). 

Step 2: The general intent is Comparative, specifically under CoCoXY since it's comparing explanations or claims between two cited works. 

Step 3: The specific class would be CoCoXY because it's contrasting results from different studies, not comparing to the current paper's methods or results. The example matches CoCoXY's definition exactly. I need to make sure it's not CoCoRes, but CoCoRes is when comparing results with the citing paper's results. Here, it's comparing two other studies, so CoCoXY is correct.
