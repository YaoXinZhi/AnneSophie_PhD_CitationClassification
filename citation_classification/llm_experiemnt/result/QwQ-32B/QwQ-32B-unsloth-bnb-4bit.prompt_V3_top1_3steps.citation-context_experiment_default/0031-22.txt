Okay, let me tackle this step by step. The user provided a citation within a scientific article about plant health, and I need to classify the rhetorical class of that citation. 

First, the context given is: "Earlier studies have shown that the application of magnetic fields can influence phytoplasmal activity in infected plants, as reported in @@CITATION@@, which demonstrated a 30% reduction in symptoms in aster yellows-infected plants treated with a 500 Gauss magnetic field."

Step 1 is to extract the relevant context. The sentence mentions that earlier studies showed magnetic fields influence phytoplasmal activity, and the citation specifically demonstrated a 30% reduction in symptoms. The key part here is that the citation is supporting the claim made in the current paper about the effect of magnetic fields.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation is used to back up the statement about the effectiveness of magnetic fields. That seems like supporting the authors' own findings or previous work, so the general intent is likely Supportive.

Now, looking at the specific classes under Supportive, there's Support and Similar. The example for Support is when the citation supports the citing authors' work. Here, the citation is presented as evidence that magnetic fields work, which supports the current paper's context. 

The Similar class is more about pointing out similarities between the cited and citing work, but here it's more about the citation providing evidence. So the most appropriate choice is Support.
