Okay, I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by following the steps outlined.

First, extract the context around the citation. The user provided the passage within backticks, but since it's not here, I assume the example given is the context. Let me check the example again. The example says, "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@@."

Step 1: The context here is about supporting a finding. The main sentence says their finding is supported by other investigations, and the citation is tagging that supporting work.

Step 2: General intent. Since the citation is used to back up their own results, the general intent is Supportive. Among the sub-classes under Supportive are Support and Similar. The example given for Support is when the citation supports the citing authors' work. The example here specifically says "is supported by recent... investigations" followed by the citation, which aligns with the Support class. The Similar class is when pointing out similarity between the cited and citing work. Here, it's more about supporting evidence rather than just a similarity. 

Step 3: The specific label. The sentence structure uses "supported by," so the correct class should be Support. The example provided under "Support" also matches this structure. The Other investigations (the citation) are supporting the current work's findings. Therefore, the answer is Support.

Support
