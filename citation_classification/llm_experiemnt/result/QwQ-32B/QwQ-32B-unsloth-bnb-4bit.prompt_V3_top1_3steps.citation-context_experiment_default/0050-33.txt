Okay, let me try to work through this step by step. The user provided a citation passage and wants me to classify the citation's rhetorical class.

First, the task says I need to extract the context around @@CITATION@@. The given passage is: 

"The role of bacterial wilt on plant health has been extensively documented, with studies showing it can reduce crop yields by up to 80% @@CITATION@@. However, the interaction between wilt pathogens and soil microbiota remains poorly understood, a gap this study addresses by examining microbial community responses under infection."

So, the citation is tagged right after the part about bacterial wilt reducing yields. The sentence mentions that studies (the cited ones) have shown the yield reduction. The next part talks about a gap the current study addresses regarding soil microbiota interaction.

Step 1: Extract context. The relevant part here is "The role of bacterial wilt on plant health has been extensively documented, with studies showing it can reduce crop yields by up to 80% @@CITATION@@." That's the part that directly introduces the citation. The rest is about the gap addressed by the current study, but maybe not necessary for the citation context.

Step 2: Identify general intent. The citation is supporting the claim that bacterial wilt reduces yields, providing evidence for that fact. The example for "Support" is when the citation supports the authors' own findings. Wait, but here the citation is backing up the statement made by the authors about prior studies. Alternatively, maybe "Motivation"? Because the current study is addressing a gap, implying that previous work showed the yield issue but not the microbiota interaction. Hmm. Wait, the citation here is presented as existing research that documents the problem (yield reduction), so the current study is addressing a different part (microbiota), but the citation itself is being used to state existing knowledge. 

Wait, let me check the definitions again. 

Motivation: cites to justify why the current research is done (like pointing out a knowledge gap). But in the example, the Motivation example mentions identifying a knowledge gap. In this case, the citation is stating what previous research has shown (the yield reduction), and then the next sentence points out the gap (interaction with soil microbiota). The citation itself is supporting the established effect of bacterial wilt, so perhaps that's "Support" because it's backing up the claim about yields, which sets up the context for the current study's motivation. 

Alternatively, maybe "Basis"? Because Basis is when the cited work is foundational. But the Basis example is about introducing the foundation for their own study. Here, the cited study's findings form the basis for understanding bacterial wilt's impact, so maybe "Basis". Wait, but the example given for "Basis" is when the current work is building on it by replicating. Here, they mention "extensively documented" by studies, so the current study isn't directly building on this specific citation but rather pointing to existing knowledge to set context for their new research area. 

Another possibility is "Neutral", but the phrase "studies showing" is presenting the cited work as evidence. The example for "Support" is when it's used to support the citing authors' work, but here the citation supports the claim being made. The "Support" example says "supports" the authors' findings, but here it's part of the authors' own background statement. Wait the example for "Support": "consistent with previous research, particularly that of @@CITATION@@". So that's similar here. The citing authors say "studies show X", so they are using the citation to support that claim, so "Support" would be appropriate here. 

Hence the general intent is Supportive, so looking at the fine-grained, the correct class is Support. 

But let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the first sentence is introducing the existing knowledge (basis for why studying wilt is important), but in that case, it might be "Motivation". The current study is addressing the "gap" in understanding microbiota interactions. The cited work's results on yield are a reason to study plant health, but isn't that more of a motivation for why the general area is important. So the citation is providing the basis for the need for this study. Wait, the definition of "Motivation" is about justifying the current research (knowledge gap, etc). The example for Motivation mentions "no explanation yet, so this study's purpose is to explain". 

In this case, the first part ("studies showing yield reduction") sets up the problem's significance, then the second sentence points out that a specific aspect (soil microbiota interaction) hasn't been studied yet. So the citation here is motivating because it shows the importance of the problem area (since it affects yields), which together with the gap forms the rationale for the current study. Hmm. So the citation here is part of the motivation. 

Therefore, maybe the general intent is Motivational, leading to the label Motivation. Alternatively, if the authors are just stating a fact that prior work has shown X, without explicitly stating that it's the reason for their study, but in the next sentence they mention the gap their study addresses. Since the citation is supporting the existing knowledge part that sets up the motivation, but maybe the motivation is the "the interaction...remains poorly understood, a gap this study addresses". The citation itself is just providing the existing knowledge (yield impact), but the motivation is the mentioned gap. So the citation here is used to support the statement about yields. 

So, if the citation is being used to support the statement made in the current paper's text (e.g., "studies show X"), then the purpose is to support that part. That seems like the Support class. The example for "Support" is "consistent with previous research, particularly that of @@CITATION@@", so that matches here. The current paper is using the citation to back up their statement about crop yield reduction. 

Therefore, the final label should be Support. Alternatively, if the citation is just giving the basis of the field, maybe Basis? But Basis is more when their current work builds on it. The example for Basis is replicating previous work. Here, they are not replicating, but using the cited work to support a premise. 

Yes, so I think Support is correct here.
