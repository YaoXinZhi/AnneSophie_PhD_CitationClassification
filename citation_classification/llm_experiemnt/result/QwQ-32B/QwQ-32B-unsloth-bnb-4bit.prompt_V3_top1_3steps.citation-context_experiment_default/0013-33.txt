Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given context. Let me start by following the steps outlined.

Step 1: Extract the context discussing the citation. The user provided the passage within backticks. Looking at the example, the context is something like: “Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@@.”

So, the relevant part is that the current study's finding is supported by other investigations, and the citation is pointing to those studies. The key words here are "supported by recent cross-taxon investigations... @@CITATION@@".

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The sentence says that their finding is supported by the cited work. That sounds like the citation is backing up their results. The general intent here would be Supportive, since they're using the citation to support their own findings.

Step 3: Now, look at the specific classes. The Support class is for when the citation supports the citing authors' work. The example given for Support is almost identical: "Our finding... is supported by previous research... @@CITATION@@." So this matches exactly. The other options: Similar is about pointing out similarity, but here it's more about support. Basis is foundational, which isn't the case here. So the answer should be Support.
