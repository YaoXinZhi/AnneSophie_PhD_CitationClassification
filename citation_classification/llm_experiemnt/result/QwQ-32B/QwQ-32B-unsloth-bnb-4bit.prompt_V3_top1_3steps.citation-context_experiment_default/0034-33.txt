Okay, let's tackle this classification. First, I need to look at the provided passage and the citation tagged @@CITATION@@. The user has given an example where the task is to determine the rhetorical class of the citation. Let's start with Step 1: extracting the relevant context.

The example passage is: "In contrast to earlier studies that focused on adult plant responses to pathogens @@CITATION@@, our study highlights the critical role of seedling stage interactions in disease susceptibility." 

The citation here is surrounded by a comparison. The key phrase is "In contrast to earlier studies...", which immediately makes me think this is a comparative situation. The general intent would be "Comparative". Now referring to Step 2's categories, Comparative narrows down to CoCoGM, CoCoRes, or CoCoXY.

Looking at the definitions:
- CoCoGM is about comparing goals or methods.
- CoCoRes is about comparing results or findings.
- CoCoXY compares explanations or claims between two cited studies.

In the example, the current study is contrasting their focus (seedling stage) with previous studies (adult plant responses). The contrast is about the research focus, which relates to the goals or methods of the studies. The cited work's goal was on adult plants, while the current study's goal is on seedlings. So this is a comparison of the research objectives or the methods' focus. Therefore, it should be CoCoGM.

Wait, but let me double-check. The sentence says "earlier studies that focused on adult plant responses" â€” that's their goal or method. The current study's goal is different. Since it's comparing the goals or targets of the studies, that's CoCoGM. If it were comparing results, like stating that the results differ because of the different stages, then it might be CoCoRes, but here it's more about what each study was examining (their focus or goals). 

Therefore, the correct label is CoCoGM.
