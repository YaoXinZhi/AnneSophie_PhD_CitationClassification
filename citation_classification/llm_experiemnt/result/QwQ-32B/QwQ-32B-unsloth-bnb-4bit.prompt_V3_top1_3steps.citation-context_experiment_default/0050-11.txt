Okay, let's tackle this. The user provided a passage with a citation marked @@CITATION@@. First, I need to extract the context around that citation. The passage says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@."

Step 1: The context here is about comparing results. The authors are saying their results are different from those in the cited work. The key part is "substantially differ from the results of the experiments..." which points to a direct comparison of findings.

Step 2: The general intent. Since they're contrasting their results with another study's, this falls under "Comparative". Now looking at the specific subclasses for comparative: CoCoGM (goals/methods), CoCoRes (results), CoCoXY (explanations/claims). Here, it's about results, so CoCoRes.

Step 3: The example given for CoCoRes matches exactly: "The results obtained in the present work... differ from the results... @@CITATION@@." So the correct label should be CoCoRes.
