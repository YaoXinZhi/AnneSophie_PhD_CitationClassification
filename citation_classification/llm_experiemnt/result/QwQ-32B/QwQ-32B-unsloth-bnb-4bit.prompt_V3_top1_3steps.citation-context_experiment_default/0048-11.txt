Okay, let's tackle this. The user provided a scientific article citation passage and wants me to classify the rhetorical class of the @@CITATION@@. 

First, the context given is: "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@@." 

Step 1: Extract the context around the citation. The key parts here are that the authors' finding is "supported by recent cross-taxon investigations" and they mention another study showing similar results in fleas and ticks. The citation is following a statement that their finding is supported by other work.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. Since the citation is used to back up their own findings, this seems supportive. The example for 'Support' is when the citation supports the citing authors' work. The example given in the definitions for Support matches: "supported by previous research...", so that's probably the direction. 

Step 3: Look at the specific classes. The options under supportive are Support and Similar. The example for Similar is when the cited work shares similarities in results, etc. Here, the citation is directly supporting the current study's findings. The exact example provided for 'Support' matches this scenario. The sentence structure is similar: "supported by recent research... particularly that of @@CITATION@@". 

Wait, the example for Support specifically mentions "as before, participants..." which is similar to pointing out a similarity. But the key difference is that 'Support' is about backing up the current study's results, while 'Similar' is pointing out that the cited work has similar results. Here, the phrase "is supported by" directly indicates that the cited work supports their findings, so it should be Support. The Similar class is more about stating that the cited work also found something similar, but without necessarily the framing of support. 

Therefore, the correct class here is Support.
