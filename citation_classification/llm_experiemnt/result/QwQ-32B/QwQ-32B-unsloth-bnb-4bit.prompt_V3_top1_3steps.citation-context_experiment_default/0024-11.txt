Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. The user provided an example where I need to assign a rhetorical class to a citation in a scientific article. 

First, the context given is: the citation is tagged as @@CITATION@@ and the passage mentions that "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." 

Starting with Step 1: Extract the context discussing the citation. The relevant part here is "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." So the key point is that the current paper is referring to a previous description of their experimental setup.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The sentence says they're using a previously described setup. That sounds like they're referencing a method or procedure from the cited work. Looking at the general intent categories, "Technical" is for when the citation is about usage of a method, tool, etc. So that points towards the "Usage" category. 

Now, moving to Step 3: Select the specific rhetorical class. The example provided for "Usage" is exactly this scenario: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." The predefined label for this is "Usage" because it's referring to the method or setup being used from the cited work. 

I need to make sure there's no better fit. "Basis" is about foundational work, but here it's a method. "Support" would be if they were backing a result, but it's about the setup. So "Usage" is correct.
