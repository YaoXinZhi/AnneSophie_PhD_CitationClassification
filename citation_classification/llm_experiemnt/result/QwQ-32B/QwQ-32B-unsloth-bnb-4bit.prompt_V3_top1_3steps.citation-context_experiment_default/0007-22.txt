Okay, let's tackle this classification. The task is to determine the rhetorical class of @@CITATION@@ in the given context. First, I need to follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Extract context discussing @@CITATION@@. The user provided a backtick-delimited passage. Let me check if there's a specific example here. Wait, the user didn't provide the actual citation context example. Oh, right, the example might have been given in the previous input. Wait no, looking back, the user's query includes a passage with @@CITATION@@? Wait, the user's task says: the passage is surrounded by backticks, but in this case, I only see the instructions. Wait, perhaps the user provided an example, let me recheck.

Wait, looking back at the user's message, they provided the task and example definitions, but the actual passage with @@CITATION@@ isn't here. Wait, maybe I missed it? Wait, the user's message structure says "the scientific article citation passage in the plant health domain", but here the user's input only includes the instructions. Hmm, this is confusing. Oh, perhaps the user's example isn't here and this is a test scenario? Wait, no, maybe I need to process the example given in the task. Wait, the user is asking me to perform the task in the context where the passage is given. But in this instance, the user hasn't provided the actual passage. Wait, perhaps the user might have made a mistake, but looking again, no. Wait the exact user message says: the passage is delimited by backticks. Wait looking at the user's instruction message, perhaps the current passage where the citation is to be analyzed is missing. Hmm. Wait, perhaps there's an error in the setup here. Wait maybe in the actual problem setup, the user is supposed to provide a passage, but here, the example given in the task isn't part of the user's input here? Wait, perhaps I need to re-examine the problem.

Wait, perhaps the user is using the example given in the task description to test me. For instance, in the "Support" example, the sentence is: "All subscales were consistent with previous research, particularly that of @@CITATION@@ also using a U.S. sample; as before, participants did not distinguish between personal interests and values as reasons for disputes, nor between competence and methods."

In this example, the citation is supporting their findings, so the answer would be 'Support'. But that's an example given in the user's instructions. Wait, maybe the user's actual task is to process a specific case presented here. Wait, looking again at the user's current input, after the instructions, the output format section says: Please strictly follow this format. Do not provide any explanations, etc., beyond the reasoning and final JSON. Wait, but the user's example might be part of the actual question here. Wait, perhaps the user forgot to include the actual passage. Alternatively, maybe in this case, the example given in the task is the one to process. Let me re-read the user's exact instruction.

Ah, no, looking at the user's message structure: they first present a CONTEXT where they are a classifier, then TASK, then the problem steps. Then the example definitions for each class. Then the output requirements. But the actual input (the passage with @@CITATION@@) seems missing. Wait, perhaps in the original problem setup, the user intended to provide an example passage, but in this case, the assistant is being prompted to apply the process. Since the user's current input doesn't include the passage with the citation in backticks, perhaps this is a mistake. However, given that the user's message ends with the request for the JSON output, maybe I should consider that perhaps the example given in the Support section is the actual context to apply here. Wait, but the user's last sentence says: "You will be given a scientific article citation passage and must assign the rhetorical class..."

Wait, perhaps this is a test scenario where the user is referring to one of the examples provided in the instructions. For example, maybe they want to use the "Support" example provided by the user as the input and see if the classifier correctly identifies 'Support' as the label. Alternatively, maybe there's a hidden passage here. Wait, the user's message shows:

"In the example for 'Support', the sentence is: 'All subscales were consistent with previous research, particularly that of @@CITATION@@ also using a U.S. sample; as before, participants did not distinguish between personal interests and values as reasons for disputes, nor between competence and methods.'"

Wait, perhaps in this particular case, the user is using the Support example as the test case, so the context is "All subscales...", and we need to classify @@CITATION@@ in that context. If that's the case, then the answer should be 'Support'.

Alternatively, maybe the user intended to present a new example but didn't include it. Since the problem is presented with the instructions, maybe the actual test is to see if I can apply it to the example they provided. Let me see again:

Since the user provides the task and definitions but no actual citation passage, perhaps it's a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the user's example is part of the current input. Wait, no, the user's message ends with the request for the output.

Hmm, given the ambiguity, perhaps the user is using an example where the cited work is being used to support the current paper's results. Let me proceed with that assumption. For instance, in the 'Support' example provided, the answer is 'Support', which is straightforward. So the steps would be:

Step 1: Extract context of citation: "All subscales were consistent with previous research, particularly that of @@CITATION@@ also using a U.S. sample; as before, participants did not distinguish between personal interests and values as reasons for disputes, nor between competence and methods."

Step 2: The general intent here is to support the current work by citing previous research that aligns with the current findings.

Step 3: The specific class would be 'Support' because it's used to back up the current study's results.

Thus the final label is 'Support'.
