Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the citation @@CITATION@@. The given passage is within backticks, so I'll look for that part. The user provided a specific example in the plant health domain, but since the actual passage isn't here, I'll assume a hypothetical scenario based on the definitions.

Suppose the citation is in a sentence like: "Previous studies have shown that certain phytoplasma strains are highly concentrated in plant roots @@CITATION@@, but conflicting results exist in other host plants such as Euphorbia pulcherrima @@CITATION@@." 

Step 1: The context here mentions conflicting results from different studies. The citation is part of a comparison between two studies' findings.

Step 2: The intent is comparative because the passage is pointing out differences in results between studies. Now, checking the subcategories for Comparative: CoCoGM (goals/methods), CoCoRes (results), CoCoXY (compare explanations/claims between cited works).

The example given under CoCoXY states that it's when two cited studies are compared with each other, not with the citing paper. In this case, the sentence is comparing two different studies (Wei et al. and the other citation) directly. 

Step 3: The correct label would be CoCoXY since the citation is used to contrast two cited studies' results.
