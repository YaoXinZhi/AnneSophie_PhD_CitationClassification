Okay, I need to figure out the correct rhetorical class for the citation in the given example. Let's start by following the steps outlined.

Step 1: Extract the context discussing the citation @@CITATION@@. The provided passage is: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." 

So the context here is that the current study's experimental setup was described in detail in the cited work. The key part is that they are referring to a method or setup used before.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The sentence is stating that the setup was described before, which suggests that the current study is using that setup. That points towards the "Technical" category since they're referring to a method or procedure. 

Looking at the specific classes, "Usage" is defined as when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup used in the current study. The example given for Usage is exactly similar: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." 

So in this case, the citation is pointing out that the current study's experimental setup was described in the cited work. Therefore, the rhetorical class should be Usage.
