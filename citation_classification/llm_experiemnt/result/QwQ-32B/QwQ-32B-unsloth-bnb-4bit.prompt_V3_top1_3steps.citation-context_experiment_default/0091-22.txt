Okay, I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Let me start by following the steps outlined.

First, I'll extract the context around @@CITATION@@. The user provided the passage in backticks, so I should look for the part where the citation is mentioned. The example given in the task says the passage is between backticks, but the user's input here might not be shown. Wait, in the problem statement, the user provided a specific example: 

The passage is: "This study uses the IAT to measure bias toward older adults, building on the foundational work by @@CITATION@@ who first established the IAT as a valid measure of implicit bias."

So, the context here is "building on the foundational work by @@CITATION@@ who first established the IAT as a valid measure of implicit bias."

Step 1: Extract the context. That sentence is the context here. The key part is "building on the foundational work" and "first established the IAT as a valid measure."

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation is presented as foundational work that the current study is building upon. The phrase "foundational work" directly points to something that is the basis for the current research.

Looking at the general intent categories: Foundational â†’ Basis. So the general intent is Foundational.

Step 3: Specific rhetorical class. The example for Basis says it's when the citation references the intellectual foundation. The sentence here says "building on the foundational work by @@CITATION@@ who first established..." which exactly matches the Basis definition. The cited work introduced and validated the IAT, which the current study is using as a foundation.

So the label should be Basis.
