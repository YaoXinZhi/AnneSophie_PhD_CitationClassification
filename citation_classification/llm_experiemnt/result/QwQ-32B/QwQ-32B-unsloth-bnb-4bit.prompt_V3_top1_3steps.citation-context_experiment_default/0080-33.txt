Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user provided a citation context and wants me to determine the rhetorical class. 

First, I need to extract the relevant context around @@CITATION@@. The given passage is: 

"Several studies have attempted to quantify the effect of neonicotinoid pesticides on pollinator populations; however, results have been inconsistent. A meta-analysis by @@CITATION@@ found no significant negative impact on honeybee colonies at field-realistic doses, while subsequent field experiments @@CITATION@@ reported declines in foraging success and brood production. These discrepancies highlight the need for more controlled studies under varying environmental conditions."

The citation here is @@CITATION@@, which refers to the meta-analysis mentioned. Now, I need to identify the general intent. The passage is discussing how different studies have inconsistent results. The cited work (the meta-analysis) is compared with subsequent field experiments that found different outcomes. The key part is "however, results have been inconsistent" and "discrepancies highlight..." which shows a comparison between the cited study's findings and others.

Moving to the rhetorical classes. The general intent here is Comparative, so looking into CoCoGM, CoCoRes, or CoCoXY. 

CoCoRes is about comparing results. The citation's meta-analysis found no impact, while others found declines. The context directly contrasts their results, so CoCoRes fits here. The comparison is between the cited work's results and the subsequent studies, not the citing paper's own work. Wait, the citing paper is pointing out discrepancies between the cited meta-analysis and other field experiments. But the example for CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies with each other, not involving the citing paper's results. 

Wait, in this example, the citing paper is comparing the cited meta-analysis (first @@CITATION@@) with "subsequent field experiments" which are also cited but perhaps the other citation. Wait, the user's context here has two @@CITATION@@? Let me check again. 

Wait the user's example had only one @@CITATION@@ placeholder. Wait the user's input is the scientific passage with "A meta-analysis by @@CITATION@@ found no significant... while subsequent field experiments @@CITATION@@ reported..." So maybe there are two citations here, but the user's current problem is about the first @@CITATION@@. Wait the user's input might have a specific citation in question. Wait the user's input shows "citation @@CITATION@@ in a scientific article passage delimited by backticks."

Wait, looking back, the user's input says the context is the backticks-delimited text. The original problem states to classify the citation tagged @@CITATION@@. So in the given passage, the first @@CITATION@@ refers to the meta-analysis, and the second @@CITATION@@ is another study. But in the scenario here, perhaps the user's citation is the first one (the meta-analysis), but the problem is to categorize the first @@CITATION@@ in the context provided. The context is the whole text between backticks. So the citation is the meta-analysis study. 

The context says that the cited study found "no significant negative impact" whereas subsequent studies found declines. The cited work's results are contrasted with others. The citation here is part of a statement that compares two different sets of results: the cited meta-analysis (first @@CITATION@@) and the subsequent experiments (the second citation maybe). But in this case, perhaps the user's specific citation is the first one, and the task is to see why it's cited. Since the context is highlighting discrepancies, the cited meta-analysis's findings are being contrasted with other studies' results. The question is whether this is CoCoRes (comparing with the citing paper's results) or CoCoXY (comparing two cited studies).

Wait, in the CoCoXY example given, it's when comparing two cited studies with each other. Here, the cited meta-analysis (first citation) is compared with subsequent field experiments (which could be another citation). So the rhetorical use here would be that the citation (the meta) is mentioned in a context that contrasts it with other cited works. Therefore, it's a comparison between the cited work and another study, so CoCoXY. 

Alternatively, the citing paper's own work is not presenting new results yetâ€”it says "These discrepancies highlight the need..." so the discrepancy is between the cited meta and the subsequent studies. The citation here is part of a discussion pointing out conflicting results between different existing studies. So the citation's role is to highlight that there are conflicting findings between it and another cited work, making it a CoCoXY. 

Alternatively, since the first citation is the meta-analysis (first citation) and the second is another study, the rhetorical function of the first citation's citation is being part of a comparison with the other study's results. Hence, the label would be CoCoXY, as it compares the cited work with another cited work. 

The CoCoRes is when the cited work's results are compared with the citing paper's results. Here, the citing paper isn't presenting their own results yet; they are discussing prior studies' discrepancies. So the comparison is between the two cited studies (meta-analysis vs. field experiments), so CoCoXY.
