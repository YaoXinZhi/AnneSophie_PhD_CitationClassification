Okay, let me work through this step by step. First, I need to look at the provided passage and the citation tagged as @@CITATION@@. The user hasn't given the actual citation context yet, so maybe I need to wait for more information. Wait, the user might have included the example from the problem statement. Let me check again. 

Oh, right, the example given is about a study where conflicting results were found between different phytoplasma strains in plants. The example says, "Fast multiplication rates and high concentration of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains have been reported in young developing leaves and roots of infected daisy plants (Wei et al., 2004; Saracco et al., 2006), although conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima @@CITATION@@." 

So the task is to analyze this citation. 

Step 1: Extract the context discussing the citation. The relevant part here is that there are conflicting results between the cited studies (Wei et al., Saracco) and the one in @@CITATION@@. The context points out that while previous studies reported high concentrations in certain plants, the cited work describes conflicting results in another plant. 

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The comparison here is between two cited studies (Wei and Saracco vs. the @@CITATION@@ work). The example mentions conflicting results, so this is a comparison of their findings. The general intent is Comparative.

Looking at the specific classes under Comparative: CoCoRes is for comparing results, CoCoXY for comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies. The example is contrasting the results of the cited works with each other, not with the current paper. The conflict is between the two cited papers and the third one (the @@CITATION@@?), or between the first two and the third? Wait, the example says "reported... although conflicting results were described for...", so the @@CITATION@@ is the conflicting one compared to Wei and Saracco. But the key here is the citation is used to compare two cited studies with each other. Wait the example given for CoCoXY is when comparing two cited studies. In this sentence, Wei and Saracco are mentioned first, then the citation's work is the one showing conflict. Wait the structure is "reported... although conflicting results (the citation) in Euphorbia". So the citation is being presented as conflicting with the prior ones (Wei and Saracco). But the example in CoCoXY is when the author compares two cited studies: Wei and Saracco's findings versus another study (the citation) that conflicts, so the citation is part of a comparison between studies. So the citation here is part of a comparison between the cited works (the cited work is being contrasted with others). That would fall under CoCoRes (since it's comparing the results of the cited work with others) or CoCoXY?

Wait the CoCoXY definition is when the citation is comparing two cited studies with each other, not the current paper. The example given for CoCoXY is when two citations are mentioned and their conflicting results. In the user's example, the citation is the third one (the one with conflicting results). The main sentence is comparing Wei and Saracco's findings with those in the cited work. But the citation here is part of the comparison between the cited works (Wei and Saracco vs. the @@CITATION@@ work). Wait, the author is comparing the cited work (@@CITATION@@) with the other two. But according to the definitions, CoCoXY is "the citation is used to compare or contrast two cited studies with each other â€” not with the citing paper." So in the example sentence, the author mentions two previous studies (Wei and Saracco) and then the cited work in @@CITATION@@ which is conflicting. The citation is part of a comparison between studies, but the comparison is three-way? Hmm, maybe I need to check the example given for CoCoXY. The example sentence provided in the problem is: "Wei et al., 2004; Saracco et al., 2006"), although conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima @@CITATION@@." So the @@CITATION@@ work is being contrasted with the prior two. Here, the citation is used to show a conflict between different cited works. Therefore, the rhetorical class is CoCoXY, since it's comparing two cited studies (the first two vs the third) in terms of their results. Thus, the comparison is between the explained claims or results of the cited studies. So the answer should be CoCoXY. 

Wait, but the definitions: CoCoRes is comparison of results between cited and current paper, while CoCoXY compares between two cited. Since here, the current paper is pointing out that the cited work (Saracco etc.) have some results, but another citation (the @@CITATION@@) has conflicting results, so the author is contrasting two cited works. The citation in question is one of the ones being compared. Hence, the label should be CoCoXY.
