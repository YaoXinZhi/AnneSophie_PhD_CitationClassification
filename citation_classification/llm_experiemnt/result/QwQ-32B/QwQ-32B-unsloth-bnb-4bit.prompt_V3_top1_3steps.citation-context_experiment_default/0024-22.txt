Okay, let's start by looking at the user's query. They want me to classify a citation in a scientific article's passage according to a predefined set of rhetorical classes. The steps given are to first extract the context around the citation @@CITATION@@, then determine the general intent, and finally pick the specific class.

The example provided talks about "Usage", where the citation is about the experimental setup. The key part here is the phrase "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." That clearly states that the cited work provided a method or setup that's being reused here. The general intent here would be "Technical", leading to the Usage class. 

Now, applying this to the current task. Let's say the citation context is something like: "In this study, we utilized the previously developed machine learning framework by @@CITATION@@ to analyze the plant disease datasets." Following the steps: 

Step 1: The context mentions using a framework from the cited work. 

Step 2: The general intent would be Technical, since it's about using a method. 

Step 3: The specific class here is Usage because they directly used the framework from the cited paper. 

Another example: If the context is "Previous studies such as @@CITATION@@ found similar results regarding the infection rates, supporting our findings," the intent would be Supportive, leading to Support class. But since each case is specific, I need the exact passage to be certain. Since in the problem description, the user provided an example for Usage where the setup was described in the citation, the correct answer there is Usage. 

Wait, the user instruction says to strictly follow the format and not explain beyond the reasoning and JSON. Wait, but the user here provided the example and the task, and wants me to respond when given a specific passage. Since the user is giving me this as a setup, perhaps they are asking for me to model the process. Wait no, looking at the user message again, they might be providing an example and then asking me to process a new input? But in the current input, maybe the actual task is to process this example? Wait, the user instruction is a bit confusing. 

Wait, the user provided a general task, then an example, and wants me to apply it. Wait the user's actual input is the one after the first part. Wait the user's message is structured as:

They are telling me that I should act as a classifier, given a citation passage, and then they ask to apply this. The example given includes a passage where the citation context says "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@."

Wait, so in that example, the answer is Usage. So in response to this example scenario, the assistant would go through the steps and then output "Usage".

So in this case, the user's instruction is to present the thought process and then the final JSON. But in the context provided here, the user is setting up the problem and maybe wants the example processed? Wait, the actual problem here is the example the user gave? Because in their message, they describe the task, and then show the example scenario where an output should be "Usage". So when they say, "Please strictly follow this format. Do not provide any explanations, additional comments, or other text beyond the reasoning and the final JSON." 

Wait, but the user's message might be setting up the parameters and now wants me to process a given input? Wait no, looking back: the user's message is structured as a query to me, where they want me to act as this classifier. But the actual content provided is their instructions. Perhaps the user is providing a test case where my thought process is needed?

Wait, maybe the problem is that the user has given me the instructions and an example, and now wants me to demonstrate processing the example. Let me re-read the user's message:

The user says "You are a classifier..." and then gives the step-by-step. They then show the example. But then the actual task the user is presenting to me is to process an input. However, in their message, the actual input is missing? Wait no, perhaps in their message, they have the context and need me to apply this thought process. Wait, looking again, the user message is:

Wait, actually looking:

The user starts with the context and task, then the steps, example definitions, and output format. Wait, perhaps the user is providing the instructions for me to follow when given a specific citation context? Like, in a real scenario, they would present a new passage, and I have to process it. But in their current message, they provided an example scenario (the Usage example), and thus I need to process that. Wait, perhaps the actual query is that scenario's text as input, but the user's message as written includes the example. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is providing the entire setup and asking for the correct label for the example they gave in the Usage example. 

In the Usage example, the citation is used to refer to the experimental setup. The steps would be:

Step 1: Extract the context: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@."

Step 2: General intent is Technical, thus leading to Usage.

Step 3: The specific class is Usage.

Thus, the correct label is "Usage".

The user wants the output only the label in the JSON, so the final answer is:

{"label": "Usage"}

Therefore, the thought process would confirm this, and then the JSON.
</think>

{"label": "Usage"}
