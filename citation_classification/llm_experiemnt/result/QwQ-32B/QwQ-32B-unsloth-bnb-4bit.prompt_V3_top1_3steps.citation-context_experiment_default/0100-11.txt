Okay, I need to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific passage. Let me start by following the steps outlined.

First, I have to extract the context around the citation. The user provided the passage within backticks. Let me read through it carefully. The passage is: "Although the role of mycorrhizal fungi in plant nutrient uptake is well-documented @@CITATION@@, recent studies have highlighted their additional role in enhancing plant resistance to bacterial pathogens. Our experiments build on this foundation to explore..." 

So, the citation is tagged here. The context mentions that the role is well-documented by the cited work, and the current study builds on this foundation. 

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The sentence says the current work "builds on this foundation." The cited work provided the foundational documentation of mycorrhizal fungi's role. That sounds like the cited work is the basis for the current research. 

Looking at the predefined classes: Basis is for foundational references. The example given for Basis mentions replicating earlier work, similar to "builds on this foundation." 

Step 3: Choosing the specific label. The key here is that the cited work is the foundation that the current study is building upon. So the rhetorical class here is Basis.
