Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user provided a task where I need to classify a citation in a scientific article based on the context given. The citation is tagged as @@CITATION@@ and is within a passage about plant health. The goal is to figure out the rhetorical class of that citation.

First, I need to extract the context discussing the citation. The example given here is the passage about how the experimental setup was described previously. The exact sentence is: “The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@.”

Step 1: Extract the context. The relevant part here is that the current study is using an experimental setup that was described in the cited work. The key phrase is "described in detail previously," which suggests that the cited work provided the method or setup used here.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. Since the citation is referring to a method or setup used in the current study, this falls under the "Technical" category, which maps to the "Usage" class. The example for Usage specifically mentions when a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup from the cited work is directly used.

Step 3: Select the specific rhetorical class. The predefined classes have "Usage" for when a method or setup is used. The example provided matches exactly with the given example for Usage. There's no mention of comparison, motivation, or criticism here. The citation is purely stating that the current work uses a previously described experimental setup, so "Usage" is the right choice.
