Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user provided a task where I need to classify a citation reference in a scientific article passage. The example given involves plant health, but the process should be the same.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation marked @@CITATION@@. The user's passage is enclosed in backticks, so I should look for that passage. Wait, actually, in the problem description, the user hasn't provided a specific example passage this time. Wait, no, looking back, the user's initial message includes the context and task but the actual example where the citation appears must have been in the user's input. Wait, actually, in the problem setup here, it's maybe an empty example? Wait no, the user's input is the task description. Oh right, the user's actual input for me to process would be a passage with @@CITATION@@, but in this case, maybe the user is providing the example of the task, and I need to simulate the process? Wait, no, perhaps there's a confusion here. Let me re-read the problem.

Wait, the user's input is the task description plus the problem structure, but when they input an actual citation example, I have to process it. However, in this current setup, perhaps the user is giving me an example of how to format the answer but wants to test my understanding. Hmm, maybe the user's actual query is the next input after this. But since in the current prompt, the user is providing the example of what the task is, perhaps the example they want me to process is the one in the problem description. Wait, looking back at the user's message, the context is all the steps and definitions. The task is to, given a passage with @@CITATION@@, classify the citation's rhetorical class. So the user would provide a citation context, and I have to process it.

However, in the current input, the user hasn't given a specific example passage. Wait, the problem given is part of the user's message? Let me check again:

The user's message starts with "You are a classifier..." up to the end. They provided a detailed task description, but perhaps the actual test case is in the next message. Maybe I need to wait for a concrete example? Wait no, in this scenario, perhaps the user is providing the example where the citation is in the plant health domain, but hasn't provided the specific citation example yet. Wait, perhaps this is part of the system initialization? Hmm, maybe I misread. Wait, perhaps the user's input ends with the #CONTEXT and #TASK sections. Then when the user input, they should present an example case with backticks. But in this case, since the current prompt is the user's first message, which includes the task instructions, but no actual citation context, then perhaps I should wait. Wait no, this is perhaps a confusion. Looking at the initial prompt given by the user, the problem is presented as a classifier that, given a passage with @@CITATION@@, determines the citation's class. The user is instructing the model on how to perform the task, and then expects the model to, when given a passage, output the label. But in this case, the current query from the user is to have the classifier do this, perhaps with a sample passage. However, in the current context, the user hasn't provided such a passage yet. Wait, no, the user's message includes a scenario where the classifier is to process a citation in a plant health passage. Wait, perhaps the example given in the task is part of that. Wait in the #TASK section, under "Support" there's an example with phytoplasma, which is plant-related. Maybe that's the example? Or perhaps the user expects the model to process the example they provided in the instructions, but the model's job is to demonstrate the process. Wait, perhaps the user is providing the task instructions and wants an example of how the model would process a given citation passage. However, in the problem instruction, the user says to "include your step-by-step reasoning. Please strictly follow this format. Do not provide any explanations, additional comments, or other text beyond the reasoning and the final JSON."

Wait, perhaps the user is providing a test scenario where I have to process a citation example provided in their message. Looking again, in the user's message, the example for "Support" in the definitions uses an example involving aphid and enamovirus, but perhaps that's just an example. Wait, perhaps the user is providing a citation passage somewhere. Let me check again:

Looking back, under "Supportive" example, the user has:

"The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." — that's the example for 'Usage' (since it's about using a method or setup).

Wait, the user provides under each category an example. The actual test case must be in the problem's user message, but perhaps I misread. Wait, the user wrote:

"Before providing the final JSON output, include your step-by-step reasoning. Please strictly follow this format. Do not provide any explanations, additional comments, or other text beyond the reasoning and the final JSON."

Ah, perhaps the user is testing the classifier with a given example passage. Let me check again the entire problem:

The user provided the task setup, including all the definitions and examples, and then ended with instructions to process a query. However, perhaps in the actual input, there's a sample citation context. Wait, looking back, the user's message ends with the output format instruction and the request for the label. But the example for "Usage" has the example with the experimental set-up. Wait, maybe the user is asking me to apply the process to one of their own examples, but since in my case I have to wait for an actual input with @@CITATION>>, perhaps this is a hypothetical setup.

Wait, perhaps the user provided an example in the problem's task description. Let's look again:

Looking at the "CoCoXY" example:

"Fast multiplication rates and high concentration of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains have been reported in young developing leaves and roots of infected daisy plants (Wei et al., 2004; Saracco et al., 2006), although conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima @@CITATION@@."

So this example is part of the user's problem setup, but in this case, when a user inputs such a citation context, the classifier should process it. Since this is the example given for CoCoXY, I suppose that if I were presented with this exact text, I should classify it as CoCoXY. But perhaps the user wants to see if I can reason through it here.

Alternatively, maybe I need to generate an example. But the user's instruction says to process a given citation passage with @@CITATION@@, but in their problem statement, they didn't present a specific one. Hmm, perhaps there's a mistake here, but since I have to follow the instructions, perhaps I should consider the CoCoXY example given in the problem as the input text.

Wait, the user's problem is to apply this to a specific passage where the citation is present, but perhaps in their actual input, that's provided. Since the user's message here is the entire setup, perhaps the actual test would come next, and this is the setup for how to answer.

Alternatively, maybe this is a test case where the example given in the task's CoCoXY section is the input. So, taking that example: the context would be "Fast multiplication rates... although conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima @@CITATION@@."

First step: Extract the context discussing the citation: the citation is pointing to the conflicting results from someone else, contrasting with previous studies.

Step 2: General intent is comparative, specifically comparing two studies (Wei et al. and Saracco vs. the cited work). So it's a comparison between two cited works, which is CoCoXY.

Thus the label would be CoCoXY.

Alternatively, if the input was the "Support" example where similar results are mentioned, the label would be Support or similar. But the CoCoXY example is the one explicitly in the task.

Wait, so in this case, the user wants me to show the reasoning for that example?

Alternatively, perhaps the user is providing all the definitions and wants me to just show the process, but if they present a citation context, then I can proceed.

In any case, perhaps I need to make sure to follow their structure. Since the user's input in this case includes the example of the "CoCoXY" in their own definitions, maybe that's the example to process here. So let's proceed with that.

Wait, the user might have intended the current message as an example, and in the next input I need to process it, but given the setup, the user wants to see how I would process such a task.

Alternatively, perhaps the user's actual question is the example given in their problem statement, and they want me to classify it.

Let me proceed with the example from the task description's "CoCoXY" section:

Passage: "Fast multiplication rates and high concentration of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains have been reported in young developing leaves and roots of infected daisy plants (Wei et al., 2004; Saracco et al., 2006), although conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima @@CITATION@@."

The citation here is being used to indicate that there's a conflicting result compared to previous studies (Wei and Saracco's work). The citation is used to show a disagreement between two different studies (Wei/Saracco vs. the one cited here), so the comparison is between the cited works themselves, not with the citing paper. So the general intent is Comparative (CoCoXY). So the specific rhetorical class is CoCoXY.

Therefore, following the steps:

Step 1: Extract context: The citation is discussing conflicting results of a phytoplasma study, contrasting with previous reports.

Step 2: General intent is Comparative, specifically comparing two cited studies' findings (Wei et al., Saracco vs. the cited work). Thus, the specific class is CoCoXY.

So the final label is CoCoXY.

Another example: Let's say the input passage was "The experimental setup was described in detail in @@CITATION@@." Then step 1's context is about using a previous experimental setup, which is Usage.

Another example: For the Support case, "Our findings are consistent with previous research by @@CITATION@@ which also showed..." → label Support.

Alternatively, the Basis example: "Building on previous work @@CITATION@@ we..." →Basis.

If the citation is used to point out a weakness, like "Although previous studies like @@CITATION@@ claim X, but these results are unreliable due to..." → Weakness.

In the given "CoCoXY" example, the user's example is part of the problem, so the correct label is CoCoXY.
</think>

Step 1: Extract the context discussing the citation: "Fast multiplication rates and high concentration of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains have been reported in young developing leaves and roots of infected daisy plants (Wei et al., 2004; Saracco et al., 2006), although conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima @@CITATION@@."

Step 2: The citation is used to contrast conflicting results between studies (Wei et al., Saracco et al. vs. the cited work), indicating a comparative intent between two cited studies, not involving the citing paper itself.

Step 3: The specific rhetorical class is CoCoXY, as it compares explanations/results of two cited studies.

{"label": "CoCoXY"}
