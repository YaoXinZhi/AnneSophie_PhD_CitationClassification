Okay, let's tackle this classification. The user provided a task where I need to assign a rhetorical class to a citation marked @@CITATION@@ in a scientific article passage about plant health. The example given is a passage discussing a study on tomato plants and how a cited work's results are different. 

First, I need to follow the steps outlined. The first step is to extract the context around the citation. The passage says: "Our findings indicate that the incidence of fusarium wilt in tomato plants grown under organic farming conditions was significantly lower compared to conventional farming setups. This contrasts with previous studies where no such difference was observed @@CITATION@@." 

The key part here is "contrasts with previous studies" and the citation follows that. The general intent here seems to be comparative because they're contrasting their results with the cited study's findings. Looking at the general intent categories, Comparative would fall under CoCoGM, CoCoRes, or CoCoXY. 

Now, to narrow it down: CoCoRes is for comparing results or findings. Since the current paper's results are contrasting with the cited work's results, this fits CoCoRes. The citation is directly comparing the results between the two studies. The example for CoCoRes mentions differing results from experiments, which aligns here. 

The Specific rhetorical class would then be CoCoRes. Let me double-check the definitions. CoCoXY is when comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies, but here it's the citing paper vs the cited one. So yes, CoCoRes is correct. Motivation or Support don't fit because it's a contrast in results, not support or justification. Usage is about methods, which isn't the case here. Weakness is criticism, but the passage is just pointing out a difference, not a flaw. So the answer should be CoCoRes.
