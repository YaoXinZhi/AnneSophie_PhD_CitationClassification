Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user provided a scientific article citation passage with the citation tagged as @@CITATION@@, and I need to classify its rhetorical class based on the given definitions. 

First, the task is to extract the context around the citation. The passage given is:

"In our study, we found that the application of magnetic fields could significantly reduce scale formation in hard water systems. This result aligns with earlier findings @@CITATION@@, which also reported a reduction but used higher field strengths."

Alright, so the context here is that the current study found a result (reducing scale with magnetic fields), and they mention that this aligns with earlier findings from the cited work, which also saw a reduction but used higher field strengths.

Step 1 is to extract the context discussing the citation. The relevant part here is "This result aligns with earlier findings @@CITATION@@, which also reported a reduction but used higher field strengths." This part directly mentions the citation in the context of their results aligning.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The current paper's result aligns with the cited work. The key words are "aligns with earlier findings" and the cited work's results (they also saw a reduction but under different conditions). The general intent here seems to be supportive because they are confirming or supporting their own findings with the cited work's results.

Looking at the specific classes: Support is when the citation supports the current authors' work. The example given for Support is similar: “All subscales were consistent with previous research, particularly that of @@CITATION@@...”, which is exactly what this is doing here—they are saying their results align with the cited work, thus supporting them.

Alternatively, Similar could be a contender because they mention the similar result (both reduced scale). The Similar class is for pointing out similarity between the cited and citing work. The example for Similar is about a finding being supported by another study's similar observations. 

Hmm, need to decide between Support and Similar. Let me check the definitions again.

Support: The citation supports the citing authors' work. The example uses "supported by previous research". Here, the current authors are saying their results align with the citation, which is a form of support—using the cited work to back up their findings. 

Similar is when they just note that there's a similarity, like "our finding is similar to that of @@CITATION@@". The phrasing here is "aligns with earlier findings", which is more about agreement and thus supporting their own result. The cited work's findings are used to reinforce the current study's validity, so Support might be more accurate.

CoCoRes would be comparing results, but here they are not contrasting or comparing; instead, they're saying the results align, so not CoCoRes. The mention of "but used higher field strengths" is an added detail but doesn't shift the intent to comparison because the main point is the alignment (similarity) in the outcome despite different conditions. 

So the correct class is likely Support.
