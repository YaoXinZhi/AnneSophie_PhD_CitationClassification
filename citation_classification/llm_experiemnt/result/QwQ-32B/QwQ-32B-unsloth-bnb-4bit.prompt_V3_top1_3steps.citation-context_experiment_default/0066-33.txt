Alright, I need to classify the citation marked @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific article passage. Let's follow the steps provided.

First, I have to extract the context around the citation. The user provided the passage within backticks. Let me check the passage again. 

The example given is about plant health: "The high incidence of root rot in maize crops has been linked to excessive irrigation practices. Previous studies have shown that overwatering increases soil moisture to levels detrimental to root health @@CITATION@@, leading to the proliferation of Fusarium fungi."

Step 1: Extract the context discussing the citation. The relevant part here is "Previous studies have shown that overwatering increases soil moisture to levels detrimental to root health @@CITATION@@, leading to the proliferation of Fusarium fungi." The citation is supporting the claim made by the authors, using previous studies as evidence.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation is being used to back up the authors' assertion about the link between excessive irrigation and root rot via Fusarium. This seems supportive. 

Now looking at the specific classes, Support is defined as when the citation supports the citing authors' work. Here, they are using the cited work to confirm their own findings or statements. Alternatively, Similar could be if they are pointing out similarity, but here it's more about support. The example for Support mentions "consistent with previous research," which aligns here. 

So the general intent is Supportive, leading me to the specific class Support.
