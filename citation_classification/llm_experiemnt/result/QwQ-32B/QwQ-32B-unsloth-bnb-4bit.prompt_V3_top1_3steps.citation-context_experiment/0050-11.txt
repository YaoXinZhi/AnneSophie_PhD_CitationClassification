Okay, let's tackle this classification problem. The user provided a scientific article citation passage and wants me to assign the correct rhetorical class to the citation marked with @@CITATION@@. The passage given is:

"In a previous study, @@CITATION@@ demonstrated that magnetic treatment of water reduces scale formation on industrial equipment. However, the underlying mechanism remained unclear, prompting further investigation in this work."

First, I need to follow the steps outlined. Let's start with Step 1: Extract the context discussing the citation. The relevant part here is: "demonstrated that magnetic treatment of water reduces scale formation on industrial equipment. However, the underlying mechanism remained unclear, prompting further investigation in this work."

Step 2 is to identify the general intent. The citation is mentioned because a previous study showed an effect (reducing scale), but the mechanism wasn't clear. The current work is investigating that mechanism. This seems like the cited work provides the motivation for the current study. The authors are pointing out a knowledge gap (the unclear mechanism) which motivated their research. That points towards the "Motivation" category.

Looking at the definitions, Motivation is when the citation justifies the current research by identifying a knowledge gap or open question. The example given for Motivation is similar: previous research showed a result but didn't explain the mechanism, leading to the current study's purpose. 

Now checking other possibilities. Could it be Basis? Basis is about foundational work. The citation here isn't the foundation but rather a prior result that highlighted a gap. Support? No, because they aren't supporting their own findings with the citation. It's more about why they did the research. Future? No, because it's not suggesting future directions but explaining the current work's motivation. 

Therefore, the correct label should be Motivation.
