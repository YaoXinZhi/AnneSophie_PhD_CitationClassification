Okay, let's tackle this classification problem. The user provided a scientific article citation passage and wants me to determine the rhetorical class of the citation marked as @@CITATION@@. The task involves three steps: extracting the relevant context, identifying the general intent, and then selecting the specific rhetorical class based on definitions.

First, the example given is: 

The citation is in the passage: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@."

Step 1: Extract the context. The sentence here is straightforwardâ€”it says that the experimental setup was described before in the cited work. The key part here is "described in detail previously," which indicates that the current study is using the setup from the cited paper.

Step 2: Determine the general intent. Since the citation is referring to a method or setup that's being used in the current study, this falls under "Technical" which maps to the Usage category. The example given for Usage is exactly this scenario: mentioning a method, tool, dataset, or setup used in the current study.

Step 3: Select the specific class. The example's answer is "Usage," which matches the definition. The cited work here is providing the method or experimental setup that the current study is utilizing, so the correct label should be Usage.
