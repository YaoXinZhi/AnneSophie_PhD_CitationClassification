Okay, let me try to work through this step by step. The user provided a task where I need to classify a citation in a scientific article's citation passage into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. The example given is about plant health, but the process should be the same regardless of the domain.

First, the task says I need to extract the context around the citation tagged @@CITATION@@. The passage is given in backticks. Wait, but in the user's input, there's no actual passage provided here. Hmm, maybe that's part of the example they were giving? Wait, looking back, the user's input is structured as a query where they want me to process a specific example. But in the current input, the user hasn't provided the actual citation passage with @@CITATION@@. Oh, right, maybe the user's actual query is following this, but in the example they gave, they might have a passage. Wait, no, looking again, the user's message includes the problem description but not the actual example passage. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something here. Wait, the user's message starts with "You are a classifier..." and then gives the task steps, but the actual example or the specific citation passage to process isn't here. Wait, maybe the user forgot to include the passage. But since this is a test, perhaps the user is providing the structure and wants me to simulate processing a given example. Wait, maybe I need to look at the problem again. Let me check the user's exact input again.

The user's input is a query where they want me to act as a classifier, but in their example, they might have provided a sample passage. Wait, no. Wait, the user's message includes the context and the task, but the actual citation passage with @@CITATION@@ isn't here. Wait, perhaps this is part of the system's setup, and the actual user input would come after. But in this case, since the user is asking me to process an example, maybe they provided an example in the problem description. Wait, looking again, under the "Example" sections for each class, there are examples with @@CITATION@@. For instance, the Basis example is: “@@CITATION@@ introduced and validated the IAT by studying biases that they consider nearly universal in humans and about which there is no social concern. We began by replicating these inoffensive results for the same purposes.” But that's just an example. The actual task requires processing a specific passage that the user would provide. Since in this case, the user hasn't given a specific passage with @@CITATION@@, perhaps this is a test to see if I can follow the steps correctly.

Wait, maybe the user's actual input is the one they pasted here, and I need to process the example given in their instructions? But the instructions are part of the problem setup. Hmm, perhaps I need to look at the example given in the user's problem description. Let me see. For instance, under "Example" for each class, there's a sample citation context. The user's task is to process a given citation context and assign the label, but in this case, they might be testing me with one of the examples. Let me check the first example under Basis. Let me pick one of the examples provided in the user's message to see how to process it.

Take the Basis example: the citation context is “@@CITATION@@ introduced and validated the IAT by studying biases that they consider nearly universal in humans and about which there is no social concern. We began by replicating these inoffensive results for the same purposes.”

Step 1: Extract the context discussing the citation. Here, the entire sentence is the context. The key parts are that the cited work introduced and validated the IAT, and the current work is replicating their results for the same purposes.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. Since the current work is building on the cited work as a foundation, the general intent is Foundational → Basis.

Step 3: The specific class is Basis. So the output would be "Basis".

Alternatively, let's take another example. Let's say the citation context is the one under CoCoRes: “The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@.”

Step 1: The context is the sentence comparing results between current work and the cited.

Step 2: The general intent is Comparative, since they're comparing results. So under Comparative, the specific class is CoCoRes (Comparison of Results).

Another example: the Weakness example: “Eighteen species, collected on cultivated and wild pear, were described from China @@CITATION@@. The taxonomic status of these species is problematic and some may not develop on Pyrus.”

Step 1: The context is pointing out that the taxonomic status is problematic, which is a criticism of the cited work's findings.

Step 2: The general intent is Critical/Analytical → Weakness.

Step 3: The label is Weakness.

So the process is: first extract the relevant context, then determine the general category (foundational, comparative, etc.), then pick the specific label based on definitions.

Now, assuming that the user's actual input includes a specific citation context, but in their current message they are providing the task description. Since the user's message ends with "Please strictly follow this format. Do not provide any explanations...", and the output should be the final JSON with the label, but the user also wants the step-by-step reasoning here.

Wait, the user's actual query might be a specific example, but in the provided message here, the user hasn't included the citation passage. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup. The user's message is the problem statement, but they want me to simulate processing an example. Alternatively, maybe the user's input is a test case where they want me to process one of the examples they provided in their definitions. Let me check the user's exact input again.

Looking back, the user's message includes all the instructions and examples but no actual citation passage to classify. That's odd. Maybe this is a mistake, but perhaps the user is asking me to outline the process using one of the examples they provided. Let's proceed with that.

Let me pick the "Support" example: “All subscales were consistent with previous research, particularly that of @@CITATION@@ also using a U.S. sample; as before, participants did not distinguish between personal interests and values as reasons for disputes, nor between competence and methods.”

Step 1: Extract context. The citation is used to say that the current findings are consistent with the cited work.

Step 2: General intent is Supportive → Support.

Step 3: The specific class is Support.

Another example: the Usage example: “The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@.” 

Step 1: Context is that the setup was described before, so they're using the cited method.

Step 2: Technical → Usage.

Step 3: Usage.

Now, if I were to process the "Motivation" example: “Our previous research @@CITATION@@ has shown that the formation of the hard calcite scale on the surfaces exposed to hard water can be successfully prevented with the applied magnetic field. The explanation of the phenomena is not yet offered and the purpose of this work is to try to understand the mechanism of the beneficial influence of the magnetic treatment.”

Step 1: The context explains that previous work showed a phenomenon, and now they're motivated to explain it, so the citation is the basis for their motivation.

Step 2: Motivational → Motivation.

Step 3: Motivation.

Wait, but according to the general intent categories, Motivational includes Motivation and Future. Since this is explaining why their current research is done (to explain the phenomenon), it's Motivation.

So the key is to go through each step methodically.

Another example, the Neutral one: “In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@.”

Step 1: The citation is just providing a neutral fact without supporting or comparing.

Step 2: Descriptive → Neutral.

Step 3: Neutral.

Alright, so the process is clear. Now, if the user provides a specific citation context, I can apply these steps. Since in their current query, they might have intended to include an example, but it's missing, perhaps I should proceed by using one of the examples provided in their definitions to demonstrate the process. But since the user's actual input here is the problem setup, maybe the correct approach is to wait for the actual citation passage. However, given the way the problem is structured, perhaps the user expects me to process an example they have in mind, but it's not present here. Alternatively, maybe this is a test to ensure I understand the process.

Given that, I'll proceed with an example from their own definitions to show how the steps work, even though ideally the user should provide the specific citation context. Let me pick the "CoCoGM" example:

Example: “Most closely related to this paper is concurrent work by @@CITATION@@ who propose a method to ‘debias’ word embeddings. Our work is complementary, as we focus instead on rigorously demonstrating human-like biases in word embeddings.”

Step 1: The context is comparing the cited work's method (debiasing) with their own focus (demonstrating biases). The key is comparing goals or methods.

Step 2: Comparative → CoCoGM or CoCoRes? Since it's comparing goals (their focus vs. the cited method), it's CoCoGM.

Step 3: The specific class is CoCoGM.

So the output would be "CoCoGM".

Another example, the CoCoXY example: “Fast multiplication rates and high concentration of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains have been reported in young developing leaves and roots of infected daisy plants (Wei et al., 2004; Saracco et al., 2006), although conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima @@CITATION@@.”

Step 1: The context is contrasting two studies (Wei et al. and Saracco et al. vs. the cited one) regarding conflicting results. The citation is used to compare two other studies.

Step 2: Comparative → CoCoXY (since it's comparing two cited studies with each other, not with the citing paper).

Step 3: CoCoXY.

Alright, so the process works. The user wants the final JSON output with just the label. The steps are to extract context, determine general intent, then pick the specific class.
