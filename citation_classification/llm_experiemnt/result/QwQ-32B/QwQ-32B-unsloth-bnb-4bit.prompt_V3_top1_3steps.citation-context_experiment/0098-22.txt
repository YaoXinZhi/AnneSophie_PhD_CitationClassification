Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the citation @@CITATION@@ from the provided passage. The user hasn't given the actual passage here, but maybe they included it in their input? Wait, looking back, the user's input is the general task description and the example. Oh, right, the actual passage with the citation is probably in the user's query that I didn't see here. Wait, no, the user's message is the entire problem. Hmm, maybe there's a mistake here. Wait, no—the user's message includes the context and task, but in the example given, the user probably expects me to process a specific example. Wait, maybe the example given in the task is the one to work on? Let me check again.

Wait, looking at the user's message, the example under "Support" is: "All subscales were consistent with previous research, particularly that of @@CITATION@@ also using a U.S. sample; as before, participants did not distinguish between personal interests and values as reasons for disputes, nor between competence and methods." The task is to assign a label to @@CITATION@@ here. Wait, but the user is giving an example, but the actual problem they want me to solve might be the one in their query. Wait, no—the user's actual input is the entire structure they provided, but maybe they want me to process a specific example. Wait, perhaps the user's actual input is the example under "Support" and they want me to classify it? Because in their instructions, they said "Please strictly follow this format. Do not provide any explanations, additional comments, or other text beyond the reasoning and the final JSON."

Wait, perhaps there was a formatting error here, and the actual citation passage to classify is the example under "Support." Let me re-read the user's input again carefully.

Looking back, the user provided the task and the definitions, then under "Support" they have an example with @@CITATION@@. But the user's actual query is asking for the classifier to process a given citation passage. Wait, but in their message, they might have included a test case. Wait, perhaps the user's actual input includes a citation passage in backticks that I need to process. Wait, no—the user's message as given starts with "You are a classifier..." and goes through the entire setup, but perhaps the example they provided is part of their input? Wait, no, the example under "Support" is part of the predefined definitions. The user is giving an example of how to do it, but the actual task they want me to perform is probably on a different example that they provided. Wait, but in the user's message, they didn't provide a specific citation passage. Wait, perhaps there's a mistake here. Wait, looking again, the user's message ends with the output format instructions, but no actual citation passage. Wait, perhaps this is a test case where the example under "Support" is the one to process. Let me check the example under "Support":

The example is: “All subscales were consistent with previous research, particularly that of @@CITATION@@ also using a U.S. sample; as before, participants did not distinguish between personal interests and values as reasons for disputes, nor between competence and methods.”

So in this example, the citation is used to support the current findings by pointing out that previous research (the cited work) also found similar results. The key phrase here is "consistent with previous research" and "as before," which indicates that the cited work's results are in agreement with the current study's findings. 

Following the steps:

Step 1: Extract the context. The citation is in the sentence where the authors state their results are consistent with previous research, specifically citing the work. The relevant context is that their findings align with the cited work's results using a U.S. sample.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. Since the citation is used to show that the current results match previous findings, this is supportive. The general intent is Supportive.

Step 3: Choose the specific class. The options under Supportive are Support or Similar. The example's definition for Support says the citation supports the citing authors' work. The example given here is exactly the Support example, so the label should be Support.
