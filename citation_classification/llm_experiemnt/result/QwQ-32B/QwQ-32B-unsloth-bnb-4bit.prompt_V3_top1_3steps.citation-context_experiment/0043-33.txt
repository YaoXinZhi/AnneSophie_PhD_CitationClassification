Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user provided a citation passage and wants me to classify the citation's rhetorical class. First, I need to extract the context around @@CITATION@@. The passage given is:

"Phytoplasma transmission by insects is highly specific, with only a few insect species capable of transmitting each phytoplasma strain @@CITATION@@. This specificity raises questions about the molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction between phytoplasmas and their insect vectors."

Alright, so the citation is in the first sentence. The context here is discussing the specificity of phytoplasma transmission by insects. The sentence states that only a few insect species can transmit each strain, and the citation is tagged there. The next sentence talks about the questions this raises regarding molecular mechanisms.

Now, step 2: identify the general intent. The citation is supporting the statement about the specificity. The authors are stating a fact (high specificity) and citing the work that probably demonstrated this. The next sentence uses that fact to pose a research question. 

Looking at the options for general intent: Supportive? Because the citation is backing up the claim about specificity. Then, the specific classes under Supportive are Support or Similar. The example for Support is when the citation supports the citing authors' work. Here, the citation is used to support the statement made in the current paper, so Support seems right. 

Wait, but let me check the definitions again. The Support class is when the citation supports the citing authors' work. The example given is when previous research is consistent. Here, the current paper is stating a fact and citing the source, so it's supporting their assertion. 

Alternatively, could it be Basis? Basis is about foundational work. But the example for Basis is introducing a concept that the current work builds on. Here, the specificity is a fact they are citing, not necessarily the foundation of their entire research. 

Motivation? The next sentence is about questions raised, which might be motivation, but the citation itself is supporting the premise. The citation here is providing evidence for the statement, so Support is more accurate. 

So the final label should be Support.
