Okay, let me start by looking at the user's query. They want me to classify a citation in a scientific article related to plant health. The citation is tagged as @@CITATION@@, and the passage is given in backticks. The task is to determine the rhetorical class of that citation based on the context.

First, I need to follow the steps provided. Step 1 is to extract the context around the citation. The user provided the passage: "The role of mycorrhizal fungi in enhancing plant resistance to Fusarium wilt has been extensively studied @@CITATION@@, with recent studies highlighting their potential in organic farming systems."

Alright, so the sentence says that the role of mycorrhizal fungi has been studied extensively, and recent studies (including the cited one) highlight potential in organic farming. The citation here seems to be supporting the current paper's discussion by pointing out previous studies. 

Moving to Step 2: Identify the general intent. The options are Foundational, Comparative, Motivational, Supportive, Technical, Critical/Analytical, or Descriptive. The sentence mentions that the cited work is part of the existing studies, and the current paper is building on that by mentioning recent studies. It seems like the citation is used to support the current discussion by showing that prior research has covered this area. That would lean towards Supportive or maybe Similar. 

Looking at the specific classes for Step 3. The options under Supportive are Support and Similar. The example for Support is when the citation supports the citing authors' work. Here, the current paper is talking about recent studies (including the citation) highlighting potential, so the citation is used to support the idea that mycorrhizal fungi's role is studied and now they are looking at organic farming. Alternatively, Similar is when there's a similarity in results or observations. 

Wait, the example for Similar is when the cited work and the current paper have similar findings. Here, the cited work is part of the existing studies, and the current paper is adding to that with recent studies. The phrase "with recent studies highlighting..." might mean that the cited work is part of the extensive studies, so the citation is supporting the current assertion that this has been studied. 

The Support class example says the citation supports the authors' work. Here, the current sentence is using the citation to back up the statement that the role has been extensively studied. So the citation serves as prior work supporting that foundation. Wait, but the Basis class is for foundational work. However, the sentence isn't necessarily saying the cited work is the basis for their current research, but rather that the cited work is part of the existing body of research. 

Alternatively, maybe it's Support because it's backing up the current paper's statement. The sentence structure is: "has been extensively studied [citation], with recent studies..." So the citation is cited as part of the extensive studies. The current authors are using the cited work to support their assertion that this area is well-studied. Therefore, the citation is used to support their claim, so Support would be appropriate. 

Alternatively, could it be Basis? Basis is when the cited work is the foundation of the current research. The example given for Basis is when they replicate the cited work. Here, the current paper isn't necessarily building on that specific cited work as a foundation but is referencing it as part of existing studies. 

Another angle: The phrase "has been extensively studied" followed by the citation suggests that the cited work is an example of that extensive study. The authors are using the citation to support their statement that this area is well-researched. So the citation is providing support for the claim made in the current text. Therefore, the rhetorical class here is Support.
