Okay, let me tackle this step by step. The user provided a scientific article passage with a citation tagged @@CITATION@@, and I need to classify the rhetorical class of that citation. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage says: "The use of magnetic fields to prevent calcite scale formation has been explored in previous studies, showing promising results @@CITATION@@. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear, prompting further investigation."

Step 1: Extract the context. The relevant part here is "showing promising results @@CITATION@@. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear..." So the citation is about previous studies showing promising results, but the current study is investigating the mechanism.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation mentions that previous work showed promising results, but the current paper is addressing the mechanism. The citation here is pointing out a knowledge gap that motivates the current research. That seems like a "Motivational" intent because it's justifying why the current research is needed.

Step 3: Choose the specific class. Looking at the options under Motivational, the example given for "Motivation" is when a previous study highlights a need or open question. The example provided is similar: previous work showed results but didn't explain the mechanism, so the current study's purpose is to understand it. That fits "Motivation".

Wait, but let me check other possibilities. The citation isn't comparing methods or results with another study, so not CoCoGM or CoCoRes. It's not supporting the current findings, but pointing out a gap. Future research isn't mentioned here, just the motivation for current work. So yes, "Motivation" is the right label here.
