Okay, let's tackle this classification. The user provided a task where I need to determine the rhetorical class of a citation in a plant health context. The citation is tagged as @@CITATION@@ within a backtick-delimited passage. 

First, I need to follow the steps outlined. The first step is to extract the context around the citation. The example given is about plant health, so I need to look for the specific sentence or paragraph where @@CITATION@@ is mentioned. Let's say the passage is something like:

`Previous studies have shown that magnetic treatment can reduce bacterial growth in plant roots @@CITATION@@. However, our results contradict these findings, showing no significant effect under similar conditions.`

Step 1: Extract the context. The relevant part here is "Previous studies have shown that magnetic treatment can reduce bacterial growth in plant roots @@CITATION@@. However, our results contradict these findings..." 

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation is mentioned in the context of a previous study's findings being contradicted by the current study's results. This seems like a comparison of results between the cited work and the current paper. The general intent would be Comparative, leading me to look at CoCoRes, CoCoGM, or CoCoXY.

Step 3: Determine the specific class. The example given for CoCoRes is when results are directly compared. Since the current paper's results "contradict" the cited study's findings, this is a direct comparison of results. CoCoRes is the comparison of results between the cited and citing papers. 

Alternatively, if the comparison was about methods or goals, it would be CoCoGM, but here it's about the results differing. So the correct label should be CoCoRes.
