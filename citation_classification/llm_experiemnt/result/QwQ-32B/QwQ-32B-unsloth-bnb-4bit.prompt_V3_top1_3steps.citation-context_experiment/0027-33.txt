Okay, let me tackle this classification problem. The user provided a citation passage and wants me to determine the rhetorical class of the citation @@CITATION@@. 

First, I need to follow the steps outlined. The first step is to extract the context around the citation. The given passage is:

"Investigations on the effects of magnetic treatment on calcium carbonate precipitation have been conducted by several researchers. @@CITATION@@ showed that magnetically treated water forms smaller CaCO3 particles compared to untreated water, which is crucial for understanding scale formation in industrial systems. However, the mechanism behind this phenomenon remains unclear, prompting further research."

So the relevant part here is: "showed that magnetically treated water forms smaller CaCO3 particles compared to untreated water, which is crucial for understanding scale formation in industrial systems. However, the mechanism behind this phenomenon remains unclear, prompting further research."

Now, step two is identifying the general intent. Let's look at the sentences. The citation is mentioned because the cited work showed a certain result (smaller particles), but the mechanism isn't clear. The current paper is prompted to research further because of this gap. 

The key part here is "However, the mechanism... remains unclear, prompting further research." That sounds like the citation is pointing out a knowledge gap or open question that the current research is addressing. That aligns with the Motivation category, which is for justifying the current research by identifying a gap or need. 

Looking at the options for general intent, Motivational leads to either Motivation or Future. Since the citation is used to explain why the current research is needed (because the mechanism is unclear), that's Motivation. Future would be if the citation suggests directions for future work, but here the current work is being motivated by the cited work's gap.

Now step three: the specific class. The example for Motivation is similar: "the explanation... is not yet offered and the purpose of this work is to try to understand..." which matches here. The citation here shows prior work's result but points out the gap, so the rhetorical class is Motivation.

Motivation
