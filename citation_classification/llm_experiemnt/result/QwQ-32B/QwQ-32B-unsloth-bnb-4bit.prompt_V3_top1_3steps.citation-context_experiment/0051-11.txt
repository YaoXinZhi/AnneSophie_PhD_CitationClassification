Okay, let me tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in a given passage according to the predefined rhetorical classes. The passage provided is about plant health, and I need to follow the steps outlined.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The user mentioned the passage is within backticks, but in the current input, the example given is: 

"In a recent study, researchers found that the application of magnetic fields could significantly reduce bacterial growth in plant irrigation systems @@CITATION@@. This method offers a promising alternative to chemical treatments, which often lead to environmental contamination."

So the context here is discussing a study where magnetic fields reduce bacterial growth, and the citation is tagging that study. The next step is to identify the general intent. The citation is introducing a method (magnetic fields) as an alternative to chemical treatments. The example given in the Support class is when the citation supports the authors' work. Here, the current study is talking about the cited work's method being a promising alternative, which supports their own argument for using such methods. Alternatively, maybe it's Usage if they are using the method from the cited work. Wait, the example for Usage is when the method is directly used in the current study. The passage here says "This method offers...", so maybe the cited study introduced the method, and the current paper is supporting its use. Let me check the definitions again.

Support: the citation is used to support the citing authors' work. The example given is when previous research's consistency is mentioned. Here, the cited study's findings are presented as a basis for the current paper's argument about the method's promise. So that would be Support. Alternatively, if the current paper is using the method from the citation, it would be Usage. But the passage says "This method" refers to the cited study's method, but the current paper might be discussing it as a support for their own approach or as a motivation. Wait, the sentence structure is "Researchers found X @@CITATION@@. This method offers Y..." So the citation is supporting the claim that the method works, thus supporting the current authors' assertion. Therefore, the intent is supportive, so the specific class would be Support. Let me confirm the definitions again. Support is when the citation supports the citing authors' work. Yes, that fits here. The other options: Basis is if it's foundational. But here it's more about supporting the current paper's point. So the answer should be Support.
