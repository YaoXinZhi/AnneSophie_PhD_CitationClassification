Okay, let's tackle this classification problem. The user provided a passage with a citation marked as @@CITATION@@, and I need to figure out the rhetorical class of that citation. Let me start by going through the steps outlined.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage given is:

"In a recent study, it was demonstrated that the application of magnetic fields can significantly reduce the formation of calcium carbonate scale in industrial water systems @@CITATION@@. This finding has important implications for water treatment facilities seeking cost-effective solutions. However, the mechanism behind this effect remains poorly understood, motivating our current investigation into the crystallization dynamics under magnetic influence."

So the citation is referring to the study mentioned here. The context here is that the study showed magnetic fields reduce scale formation, but the mechanism isn't understood, which is why the current study is investigating it.

Step 2 is to identify the general intent. The citation is pointing out that prior work has shown a result (the effectiveness of magnetic fields), but there's a gap in understanding the mechanism. The current study is motivated by this gap. That sounds like the citation is used to motivate the current research, pointing out a knowledge gap. So the general intent would be Motivational, leading to either Motivation or Future.

Looking at the specific classes under Motivational: Motivation is for justifying the current research by identifying a gap, need, etc. Future is for suggesting future directions. Here, the citation is used to explain why the current study is being done (because the mechanism isn't understood), so that's Motivation.

Now, checking the examples for Motivation: The example given is a previous study showing a result, and the current purpose is to explain the mechanism, which matches exactly what's in the passage. So the correct label should be Motivation.
