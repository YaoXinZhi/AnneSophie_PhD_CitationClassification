Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user provided a scientific article passage with a citation tagged as @@CITATION@@, and I need to classify the rhetorical class of that citation. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The given passage is: 

"The role of phytoplasma titer in host plant colonization has been studied in several crops, with conflicting results. For instance, in daisy plants, high titer strains were associated with efficient colonization @@CITATION@@, whereas in Euphorbia, low titer strains showed better colonization success @@CITATION@@."

Looking at the part with @@CITATION@@, the relevant context here is "whereas in Euphorbia, low titer strains showed better colonization success @@CITATION@@", but the citation is part of a comparison between two studies. The sentence starts by mentioning conflicting results from different crops. The first citation refers to daisy plants with high titer strains, and the second (the one we're focusing on) is about Euphorbia with low titer strains. 

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The sentence is comparing results from two different studies (daisy vs. Euphorbia) showing conflicting outcomes regarding phytoplasma titer and colonization. Since the citation is part of a comparison between two cited works, the general intent here is Comparative. 

Now, looking at the specific rhetorical classes under Comparative: CoCoGM (comparison of goals/methods), CoCoRes (comparison of results), or CoCoXY (comparison of explanations or claims). 

The example given for CoCoXY is when two cited studies are compared with each other, not with the citing paper. Here, the sentence is directly contrasting the results of the two studies (high titer vs. low titer leading to different colonization success). The key phrase is "conflicting results" which points to a direct comparison between the two cited works. 

So, the specific class should be CoCoXY because it's comparing the explanations or findings (results) between the two cited studies. The citing paper is pointing out that the two studies have conflicting results, which falls under CoCoXY as per the definition where the citation is used to compare two studies' results.
