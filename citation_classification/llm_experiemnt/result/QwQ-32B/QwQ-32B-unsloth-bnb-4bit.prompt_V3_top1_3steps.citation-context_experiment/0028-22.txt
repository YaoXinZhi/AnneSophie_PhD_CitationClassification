Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user provided a scientific article passage with a citation tagged @@CITATION@@ and wants me to classify the rhetorical class of that citation. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage given is:

"In a recent study, it was found that the application of magnetic fields can reduce bacterial growth on plant surfaces @@CITATION@@. This finding is significant as it offers a non-chemical approach to plant disease management. However, the mechanism behind this effect remains unclear, prompting further investigation into the interaction between magnetic fields and microbial activity."

Step 1: Extract the context discussing the citation. The relevant sentences are: "In a recent study, it was found that the application of magnetic fields can reduce bacterial growth on plant surfaces @@CITATION@@. This finding is significant as it offers a non-chemical approach to plant disease management. However, the mechanism behind this effect remains unclear, prompting further investigation into the interaction between magnetic fields and microbial activity."

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation is mentioned because the current study is building on it. The authors note that the mechanism is unclear, which is why they are investigating further. This sounds like the citation is the basis for their motivation to do more research. The key phrase here is "However, the mechanism... remains unclear, prompting further investigation." That points to the cited work identifying a knowledge gap, which motivates the current study. 

Looking at the classes, "Motivation" is for justifying the current research by pointing out a knowledge gap or need. The example given for Motivation mentions a previous study showing a phenomenon without explanation, leading to the current study's purpose. That's exactly what's happening here. The cited study showed a result (magnetic fields reduce bacterial growth), but since the mechanism isn't clear, the current work is motivated to explore that.

Alternatively, could it be "Future"? The Future class is for suggesting future directions. But here, the current paper is addressing the gap directly, so it's more about motivating their own work rather than suggesting a future direction. 

So the general intent is Motivational, and the specific class should be Motivation.
