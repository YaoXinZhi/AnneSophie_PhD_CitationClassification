Okay, let me start by reading through the user's problem carefully. They want me to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in a scientific article's citation passage into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. The example given is in the plant health domain, so I need to focus on that context.

First, I need to follow the three steps outlined. Step 1 is to extract the context around the citation. The user provided the passage within backticks, so I should look for that. Wait, actually, in the current input, the user hasn't provided the specific passage with the citation yet. Oh, right, maybe the user's input is the example they provided earlier? Wait, no, looking back, the user's actual input is the problem description, and the example they provided is part of the instructions. Wait, perhaps I need to process the example they gave. Wait, no—the user's actual input is the problem statement, but in their message, they included the example of the task. Wait, maybe the user is providing a test case? Let me check again.

Wait, the user's message starts with "You are a classifier..." and ends with the output format. The example given in the instructions includes a citation example for each class. The actual task is presented as the problem, so perhaps the user is providing a test case where the citation context is provided, but in the current prompt, maybe the user hasn't included the actual citation passage? Wait, looking again, the user's message includes the context and task but the example is part of the instructions. Wait, perhaps I need to process the example provided in the user's message as the test case?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me parse the user's message again. The user provided a scenario where I need to act as a classifier. The task is to take a citation passage (delimited by backticks) and classify the citation's rhetorical class. The user's example includes a passage like: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." which would be classified as Usage. But in the actual problem, the user hasn't provided the specific citation passage to analyze. Wait, perhaps this is a mistake? Wait, no—the user is giving an example of how to format the input and expected output, but the actual input for me to process is the example they provided? Wait, perhaps the user is providing a sample scenario where I need to process their own example. Wait, the user's message is the entire problem setup, but they might have included a test case in the example. Let me check again.

Wait, looking at the user's message, they wrote:

"Below are the fined-grained rhetorical class definitions and examples."

Then they list examples like "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." which is an example for Usage. But that's just part of the instructions. The actual task is presented as: "You are a classifier that assigns to a rhetorical class the citation tagged @@CITATION@@ in a scientific article passage delimited by backticks." So the user expects me to process a passage provided between backticks, but in the current input, the user hasn't provided such a passage. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in not including the actual citation passage here. But in their initial problem statement, they might have intended to include an example passage. Wait, maybe I need to look at the example they provided in the instructions as the test case. For instance, in the example for "Usage", the citation is in the context of describing the experimental setup, which would be classified as Usage. So maybe the user wants me to process that example and see if the classification is correct. But the user's actual instruction is to process the citation in the given passage (delimited by backticks), but in their message, the backticks are only used in the example of the output format: "Think step by step. Return only one label..." So perhaps this is an error, and the actual test case is missing. Alternatively, maybe the user provided an example and wants me to process it. Alternatively, perhaps this is a meta-instruction, and the user will provide a specific passage in a follow-up. Wait, but the user's message ends with the output format instruction, so perhaps this is the entire input. Hmm, this is confusing. 

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the user's message includes the passage to analyze, but I need to check again. Let me re-read the user's message carefully.

The user's message is structured as follows:

They start by stating that I am a classifier. Then, they give the task: extract context, identify intent, assign the rhetorical class, etc. Then steps 1, 2, 3, definitions, examples, and output format. The example for "Usage" is "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." which is an example of Usage. 

Wait, perhaps the user wants me to process this example and return the correct label. Since the user's instruction says "Please strictly follow this format. Do not provide any explanations...", maybe the user is testing if I can process the example given in the instructions. Let me check the example for "Usage": "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." 

In this case, the citation is referring to a method or setup used in the current study, so the rhetorical class should be Usage. Therefore, the correct label is "Usage". But the user wants me to go through the steps. Let me walk through the steps as per the example.

Step 1: Extract context discussing the citation. The citation is in the example sentence: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." So the context is that the current paper is using a previously described experimental setup.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. Since the citation is referring to a method or setup used in the current study, the general intent is "Technical" which maps to Usage.

Step 3: The specific class is Usage. So the final answer would be "Usage".

Alternatively, maybe the user provided another example but in the problem statement. Wait, another example is "Support" where the citation supports the current work's findings. Let's see another example: "All subscales were consistent with previous research, particularly that of @@CITATION@@ also using a U.S. sample; as before, participants did not distinguish between personal interests and values as reasons for disputes, nor between competence and methods." Here, the citation is supporting the current results, so it's "Support".

But in the current case, the user's message includes the example for "Usage" and wants me to process it. Since the user's task is to classify the citation in the given passage, and the example provided is exactly the Usage case, perhaps this is the test input. 

Therefore, following the steps:

Step 1: The context is "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." 

Step 2: The intent here is that the current study is using the cited work's experimental setup, so it's Technical → Usage.

Step 3: The specific class is Usage.

So the final answer should be "Usage".

Wait, but the user might have intended to provide a different example. Let me check again. The user's actual input might be the example given in the problem statement, but perhaps I need to process another example. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in not including the actual citation passage. But given the information provided, the best I can do is process the example given in the instructions. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is providing the example as part of the instructions, and the actual test case is another one. But since the user hasn't provided another passage, perhaps this is a test to see if I can process the example correctly. 

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The user might have intended to present a scenario where the citation is in the context of the example for "Usage", so the correct answer is Usage. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user is providing all the instructions and wants me to confirm the process. But the user's final instruction says: "Please strictly follow this format. Do not provide any explanations, additional comments, or other text beyond the reasoning and the final JSON." 

Wait, looking back, the user's message ends with the output format instruction. The user's actual input might be the problem setup, but without a specific citation passage. Therefore, perhaps this is an error, and the user forgot to include the passage. But given the information provided, I can only work with the example given in the instructions. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user is providing the example of the "Usage" class and wants me to confirm the classification. Since the example for "Usage" clearly states the experimental setup was described in the cited work, which is used in the current study, so the answer is Usage. 

Therefore, the final answer is "Usage".
