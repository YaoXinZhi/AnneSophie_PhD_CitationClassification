Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user provided a query where I need to classify a citation in a plant health context. The citation is tagged as @@CITATION@@ within a backtick-delimited passage. The task is to determine the rhetorical class of that citation using the given definitions.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The example given in the user's message is crucial here. Let me check the example again. The example passage is:

"Investigations into the effects of magnetic treatment on calcite scale formation have been limited to qualitative observations @@CITATION@@. Our study employs a novel quantitative approach to analyze crystal morphology and growth kinetics under magnetic fields."

So the citation is in the first sentence. The context here is that previous studies (the cited work) have only done qualitative observations, while the current study uses a quantitative approach. 

Step 1: Extract the context. The relevant part is "Investigations into the effects of magnetic treatment on calcite scale formation have been limited to qualitative observations @@CITATION@@." This tells me that the cited work's studies were limited in their methods.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The current paper is pointing out that prior work (the citation) had limitations (only qualitative), and their study is doing something different (quantitative). This seems like pointing out a gap or a shortcoming in the cited work, which motivated their research. Alternatively, it could be motivating their own study by showing what's missing. 

Looking at the definitions: Motivation is when the citation justifies the current research, like identifying a knowledge gap. Here, the cited work's limitations (only qualitative) are highlighted, which creates a gap that the current study addresses. That fits under Motivation.

Alternatively, could it be Future? No, because Future is suggesting directions for future research, which isn't the case here. The current study is addressing the gap now. 

Another angle: Is this a comparative statement? The current study's method is different, but the citation isn't being compared directly with the current work's methods yet. The focus is on the cited work's limitation leading to the need for the current study. So Motivation seems right. 

Wait, the example for Motivation says: "identifying a knowledge gap, need, promising results or open question." Here, the cited work's limitation (limited to qualitative) indicates a gap, so the current study is motivated by that. 

Therefore, the general intent is Motivational, and the specific class is Motivation.
