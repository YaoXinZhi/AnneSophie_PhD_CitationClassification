Okay, let's tackle this classification problem. The user provided a scientific article passage with a citation tagged as @@CITATION@@, and I need to determine the rhetorical class of that citation based on the given definitions.

First, I need to follow the steps outlined. Starting with Step 1: Extract the context discussing the citation. The passage given is:

"The role of phytoplasma titer in insect transmission has been widely studied in leafhoppers @@CITATION@@ and planthoppers @@CITATION@@, but little is known about this relationship in psyllids. Our study fills this gap by demonstrating that higher titer correlates with increased transmission efficiency, similar to previous findings in leafhoppers @@CITATION@@."

The citation here is the third one, so the context around @@CITATION@@ is: "similar to previous findings in leafhoppers @@CITATION@@", which is part of the sentence stating that their study's results are similar to previous work on leafhoppers.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The sentence says their findings are similar to previous ones in leafhoppers. The general intent here seems to be pointing out a similarity between their results and the cited work. That would fall under the "Supportive" category since they are showing their results align with others, but looking at the specific classes, "Similar" is a more precise fit because it's specifically about pointing out a similarity in results or observations.

Step 3: Select the specific rhetorical class. The example for "Similar" mentions that it's used when pointing out similarities in results, which matches here. The sentence structure uses "similar to previous findings," which directly aligns with the Similar class definition. The other options like Support might be close, but "Similar" is more exact here since it's about the similarity rather than just supporting their own work. The citation isn't being compared for methods or goals (so not CoCoGM or CoCoRes), nor is it foundational or motivational. Therefore, the correct label should be Similar.
