Okay, let's tackle this classification problem. The user provided a scientific article passage with a citation marked as @@CITATION@@, and I need to figure out which rhetorical class that citation falls into. Let me start by recalling the steps outlined.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage given is:

"The application of magnetic fields to inhibit scale formation in hard water systems has been explored in prior studies @@CITATION@@. However, these studies did not address the long-term stability of the inhibition effect, which our research aims to investigate."

So the relevant part is: "The application of magnetic fields to inhibit scale formation in hard water systems has been explored in prior studies @@CITATION@@. However, these studies did not address the long-term stability of the inhibition effect, which our research aims to investigate."

Step 1 is done. Now, step 2 is to identify the general intent. Let's look at the sentence structure. The citation is mentioned in the context of prior studies that explored the application, but then the authors point out a gap: the studies didn't address long-term stability. The current research is aiming to investigate that. 

This seems like the citation is being used to highlight a knowledge gap that the current study is addressing. The example for 'Motivation' mentions justifying the current research by pointing out a knowledge gap or need. The sentence structure here uses the citation to show prior work, then states what those studies lacked, which motivates the current research. 

Looking at the options for general intent, 'Motivational' would fit here because it's explaining why the current study is necessary. The specific subclass under Motivational is either 'Motivation' or 'Future'. The example for 'Motivation' is when previous research shows something and the current work's purpose is to address an unanswered question. Here, the citation points out prior work, and the authors are saying that since those didn't look at long-term stability, their study does. That's definitely a motivation for their research. 

Now, checking the specific classes. 'Motivation' is the subclass here. The other options: 'Future' is for suggesting future directions, but here it's the current study's motivation, not suggesting future work. 

So the answer should be 'Motivation'.
