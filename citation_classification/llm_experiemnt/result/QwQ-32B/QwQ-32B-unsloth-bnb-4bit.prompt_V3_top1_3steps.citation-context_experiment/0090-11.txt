Okay, let me tackle this step by step. The user provided a query where I need to classify a citation in a scientific article's passage. The citation is tagged as @@CITATION@@, and I have to determine its rhetorical class based on the given definitions.

First, I need to follow the three steps outlined. Starting with Step 1: Extract the context discussing the citation. The user's example passage is within backticks, so I should look for that. Wait, the user's input here might have a specific example, but in the current problem, the user hasn't provided the actual citation passage. Wait, looking back, the user's message includes the task and context but not an example passage. Wait, maybe I need to check again. Oh, no, in the problem presented, the user is giving me the structure and an example of how to do it, but the actual input for classification is missing here. Wait, perhaps the user's actual input is the example they provided? Wait no, looking at the user's message, they provided the task and the definitions, but the actual passage with the citation is part of the problem they're asking me to solve. Wait, maybe I need to check again.

Wait, the user's message starts with "You are a classifier..." and then gives the task. The example they provided includes a passage with @@CITATION@@, but in the current problem, the user hasn't provided the actual text to classify. Wait, perhaps I need to look at the exact input given here. Wait, the user's input here is the problem statement, and the actual citation passage is part of the query. Wait, no, looking at the user's message, they might have included the example as part of the instructions. Wait, maybe the user is providing the example as part of the instructions, but the actual problem they want me to solve is in the current query? Wait, maybe I need to re-examine the exact input given.

Wait, the user's input is the entire message up to "Please strictly follow this format..." and then the example. But in this case, the user hasn't provided a specific citation passage for me to classify. Wait, perhaps this is a test case where the user is showing the structure, but in the actual problem, I need to process a specific example. Wait, maybe the user's actual input is the problem they want me to solve, but perhaps the example they provided in their message is the one to classify. Wait, no, the example given by the user is just an example of how to do it. The user's actual task is to process a specific citation passage they provide. But in the current query, the user's message does not include the actual passage with the citation. Wait, perhaps there was a mistake here. Wait, looking again:

The user's message starts with "You are a classifier..." and includes the task, steps, definitions, and output format. The example they give includes a citation passage like:

"Most closely related to this paper is concurrent work by @@CITATION@@ who propose a method to 'debias' word embeddings. Our work is complementary, as we focus instead on rigorously demonstrating human-like biases in word embeddings.”

But that's part of the example definitions. The actual problem they want me to solve is the one in the current query, but perhaps the user forgot to include the specific citation passage here. Wait, maybe I need to look at the problem again. Wait, the user's exact input is the entire text up to "Please strictly follow this format..." and the example. But the actual problem they want me to solve is the one presented in their query? Wait, perhaps the user is providing a test case where they want me to process their own example. Wait, but in their instructions, they mention that the citation is in a scientific article citation passage in the plant health domain. However, the example provided in their definitions is about word embeddings and other fields. Hmm, maybe there's confusion here. Alternatively, perhaps the user is asking me to apply this process to a specific example they provided, but I need to check again.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The user is providing the task and the steps, and wants me to apply it to a specific citation passage that they have included in their message. Wait, looking again, the user's message includes the example in the definitions, but perhaps the actual input to process is the example given under CoCoGM? Let me see:

In the example for CoCoGM, the citation is used to compare the methods. The example text is: “Most closely related to this paper is concurrent work by @@CITATION@@ who propose a method to 'debias' word embeddings. Our work is complementary, as we focus instead on rigorously demonstrating human-like biases in word embeddings.”

So, if that's the example given, perhaps the user is asking me to classify that example? But the user's instruction says "Please strictly follow this format. Do not provide any explanations..." but the user might have included that example as part of the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the user wants me to process their own example here. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake and the actual input to classify is part of their query. But in the current setup, the user hasn't provided the actual citation passage here. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user is providing the structure and wants me to show how the process works on the example they provided. But in that case, the example under CoCoGM would be the input. Let me try that. Let's take the example given under CoCoGM and process it step by step.

The example is:

“Most closely related to this paper is concurrent work by @@CITATION@@ who propose a method to 'debias' word embeddings. Our work is complementary, as we focus instead on rigorously demonstrating human-like biases in word embeddings.”

Step 1: Extract the context discussing the citation. The relevant part here is the entire sentence since it's discussing the cited work's method and contrasting it with their own.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The example is comparing the cited work's method (debiasing) with their own focus on demonstrating biases. This is a comparison of goals or methods between the cited work and the current paper. So the general intent is Comparative.

Step 3: Select the specific class. Since it's comparing goals/methods, the class is CoCoGM.

But the user wants me to do this for their input. Wait, but in the current problem, the user hasn't provided a specific citation passage except the examples. Since the user's instructions include an example for CoCoGM, maybe this is a test case. Alternatively, perhaps the user's actual input is missing, but in the current context, the example provided is part of the problem. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is asking me to process the example given in their own message. Let me see the problem again. The user says "You are a classifier that assigns a reference... Please strictly follow this format..." and then provides the example definitions. But the actual task is to process a specific citation passage provided by the user, which in this case isn't present. Wait, perhaps there's a mistake here. Since the user's message includes the example under CoCoGM, perhaps they want me to process that example as the input. 

Assuming that, then following the steps:

Step 1: The context is the sentence mentioning @@CITATION@@. The example sentence is the context.

Step 2: The general intent is Comparative, since they are comparing their work's goals/methods with the cited work.

Step 3: The specific class is CoCoGM.

So the final label is CoCoGM.

Alternatively, maybe the user is testing me with that example. Since they provided that example as part of the instructions, but want me to process it as an input. The output should be CoCoGM.

Alternatively, perhaps the user's actual input is a different passage, but in the current query, they didn't include it. Since the user's message ends with the output format, maybe they expect me to process their own example. 

Alternatively, perhaps I need to look for the citation in the user's message. Let me check again. The user's message includes an example under "CoCoGM" where the citation is in the sentence: 

“Most closely related to this paper is concurrent work by @@CITATION@@ who propose a method to 'debias' word embeddings. Our work is complementary, as we focus instead on rigorously demonstrating human-like biases in word embeddings.”

If this is the input to classify, then the answer is CoCoGM. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user is providing this as an example and wants me to demonstrate the process on it. Since the user's instructions say "Please strictly follow this format. Do not provide any explanations...", but the user's message includes the example. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user is providing the example to show how it's done, but the actual problem is a different one they have in mind, which isn't provided here. But since the user's message is as given, maybe the example is the input. 

In that case, the answer would be CoCoGM. 

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Since the user's message ends with the output format, perhaps they want me to process the example they provided in the instructions. Let's proceed with that.
