Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user provided a task where I need to classify a citation in a scientific article into one of several predefined rhetorical classes. The example given is about plant health, so I need to pay attention to the context around the citation @@CITATION@@ in the provided passage.

First, I need to extract the context discussing the citation. The user mentioned that the passage is within backticks, but in the current input, I see the example with the citation in the middle. Wait, actually, looking back, the user's input includes the problem description but not the actual passage with the citation. Wait, no—the user's message starts with the context and task, then the example. Wait, the user's message is structured as a query where they want me to process a specific citation in a passage, but in the current input provided to me, the user hasn't given the actual passage with @@CITATION@@. Wait, maybe I need to look at the problem again.

Wait, the user's message is the entire setup for the problem. The actual test case isn't provided here. Wait, no—the user is giving an example of how they want me to process a citation in a passage. Wait, perhaps the user is providing an example scenario where they want me to simulate the process. Wait, perhaps the user's input is a test case where the citation is part of the example given. Let me check again.

Looking at the user's message, after the definitions, they say: "Please strictly follow this format. Do not provide any explanations, additional comments, or other text beyond the reasoning and the final JSON." Wait, but in the user's message, the example given is the "Usage" example. Wait, perhaps the user is presenting a scenario where the citation is in the example provided. Let me re-examine the user's message.

Wait, the user's message includes a task where they want me to process a citation in a scientific article passage. The example given in the task includes a citation example. Wait, but in the current input, the user hasn't provided a specific passage with @@CITATION@@ to process. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup. The user is giving me a problem where they want me to process a citation in a passage, but the actual passage isn't included here. Wait, perhaps the user is providing an example scenario where the citation is part of the example they gave. Let me read again.

Wait, perhaps the user is asking me to process the example they provided. For instance, the example under "Usage" says: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." So maybe in that case, the correct class is "Usage". But in the current query, the user is giving me the instructions, but not the actual passage. Hmm, perhaps I need to see the exact input they want me to process. Wait, maybe I misread the user's message. Let me check again.

The user's message starts with "You are a classifier..." and describes the task. Then they give the context and task, followed by steps, definitions, and an example. The actual problem they want me to solve might be the example they provided? Or perhaps they expect me to process a sample input they provided? Wait, looking again, perhaps the user is providing an example of how the output should be structured, but in their actual input, they need me to process a specific citation context. Wait, no, perhaps the user is asking me to process the example they provided in the "Usage" section. Let me see:

In the "Usage" example, the citation is used to refer to a method or experimental setup. The sentence is: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." So the rhetorical class here would be "Usage" because the citation is referring to a method used in the current study. Therefore, following the steps:

Step 1: Extract context. The sentence is "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." The key part is "experimental set-up...described in detail previously", so the context is about using a previous setup.

Step 2: General intent. Since the citation is referring to a method/tool/experimental setup used, that's Technical, so the specific class is Usage.

Therefore the output would be "Usage".

Alternatively, if another example was given, but in the user's message, the example under "Usage" is the one to consider here. Wait, perhaps the user is providing the example to test the classifier, and wants me to process that example. Since the user's instruction says "Please strictly follow this format. Do not provide any explanations...", perhaps they want me to process the example given in the "Usage" part. But the user's actual input might be the example they provided, but I'm supposed to think through it.

Alternatively, maybe the user is giving me a problem where they want me to process a specific passage. But in the current input, the user hasn't provided that. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me re-express the user's message again:

The user provides a task where they want me to classify a citation in a passage. They explain the steps, definitions, and examples. The actual test case they want me to process is likely the example given under "Usage", but perhaps the user is providing that as part of their instruction, and wants me to process it as a test case. Since the example under "Usage" is "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." So the citation here is referring to the setup used in the current study, so the class is Usage.

Therefore, following the steps:

Step 1: Extract the context. The sentence is exactly the example given for "Usage".

Step 2: General intent is Technical, so specific class is Usage.

Hence the output should be "Usage".

But perhaps I need to ensure that I'm not missing anything. Let me check again the definitions:

The "Usage" class is when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup from the cited work that is directly used in the current study. The example matches that exactly. So yes, the correct label is Usage.

Alternatively, maybe the user is providing this example to me as part of the problem, and wants me to simulate the process for that example. In that case, the correct answer is "Usage".

Alternatively, perhaps the user is asking me to process the citation in the passage provided in the example given in the problem description. Since the problem's example under "Usage" is the one to process, then the answer is Usage.

Therefore, I should output "Usage".
