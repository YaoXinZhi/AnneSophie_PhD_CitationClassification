Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a scientific article passage with a citation tagged as @@CITATION@@, and I need to classify the rhetorical class of that citation based on the given definitions. Let me start by following the steps outlined in the task.

First, I need to extract the context discussing the citation. The passage given is:

"The study by @@CITATION@@ demonstrated that the application of magnetic fields can significantly reduce calcium carbonate scale formation in industrial water systems. Our experiments build upon their findings by investigating the long-term effects of varying magnetic field strengths on scale inhibition efficiency under different water chemistries. These results are crucial for optimizing magnetic treatment systems in real-world applications."

Alright, so the relevant part here is the sentence mentioning the citation and the following sentences that discuss how their work is used. The key points here are that the cited study demonstrated the effectiveness of magnetic fields in reducing scale, and the current study builds upon their findings by looking at long-term effects and different parameters.

Step 2 is to identify the general intent. The citation here is being used as a foundation because the current study is building upon their previous findings. The cited work provided initial results, and now the new study is extending it. That would fall under Foundational intent, leading to the Basis class. But let me check the definitions again to be sure.

Looking at the Basis definition: "the citation references the intellectual foundation of the current research." The example given is about replicating previous results. Here, the current work is building upon the cited study's findings, which aligns with using it as a basis. 

Alternatively, could it be Support? The cited work supports the current study's approach, but the key here is that they are building upon it, which is more foundational. Support is when the cited work confirms or supports the current findings, but here it's more about the prior work being a starting point.

Motivation? The citation might be motivating the current research by pointing out a need to investigate further (long-term effects). But the example for Motivation is about filling a knowledge gap. The sentence here says "build upon their findings," which is more foundational than just motivation. 

So the general intent is Foundational, so the specific class should be Basis.
