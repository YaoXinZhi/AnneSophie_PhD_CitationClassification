Okay, let me tackle this step by step. The user provided a scientific passage where a citation is tagged as @@CITATION@@. My job is to classify the rhetorical class of that citation based on the given definitions. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage says: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." So the key part here is "experimental set-up was described in detail previously." 

Next, identifying the general intent. The sentence is stating that the setup they used was already detailed in the cited work. That sounds like they are referring to a method or procedure used in their current study. 

Looking at the predefined classes, the Usage category is for when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup from the cited work that's directly used. The example given for Usage is almost identical: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." 

So the general intent here is Technical, which maps to the Usage class. There's no comparison, support, or criticism hereâ€”just a direct reference to using a previously described setup. Therefore, the most appropriate label is Usage.
