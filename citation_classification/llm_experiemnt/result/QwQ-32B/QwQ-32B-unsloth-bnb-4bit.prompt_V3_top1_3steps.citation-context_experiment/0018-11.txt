Okay, let's tackle this classification problem. The user provided a scientific article passage with a citation tagged as @@CITATION@@, and I need to determine the rhetorical class of that citation. Let me go through the steps carefully.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage given is:

"The use of CRISPR-based tools in plant pathology has grown significantly over the past decade. However, challenges remain in delivering these tools efficiently to plant cells. @@CITATION@@ reported successful delivery in model plants using a viral vector, but this method is less effective in woody species due to species-specific constraints. Our study builds on this by developing a novel nanoparticle-based delivery system that overcomes these limitations."

Alright, so the context around the citation mentions that the cited work reported successful delivery in model plants using a viral vector, but notes that this method is less effective in woody species. The current study is building on that by developing a new system. 

Now, step 2 is to identify the general intent. The citation here is pointing out a previous method's limitations (viral vector effectiveness in woody species) and the current study is addressing that. The cited work is being used to highlight a problem that the current research is trying to solve. 

Looking at the general intent categories, this seems like it could be Motivational because it's identifying a knowledge gap or a problem that the current study is addressing. The cited work shows success in model plants, but the limitation in woody species motivates the need for the new nanoparticle method. 

But wait, let me check the definitions again. The Motivation class is when the citation justifies why the current research is done, like pointing out a knowledge gap or a need. Here, the cited work's limitation is the reason the current study is necessary. That fits Motivation. 

Alternatively, could it be Weakness? The citation is pointing out a flaw (the method's ineffectiveness in woody species) in the cited work. But the Weakness class is when the citation is used to criticize the cited work. Here, the cited work's own method has a limitation, which the current study is building upon. The main intent here is to motivate the current research by showing that existing methods have shortcomings. 

So the general intent is Motivational. Now, the specific classes under Motivational are Motivation and Future. The example for Motivation is when previous work shows something, and the current work is addressing a follow-up. The example given for Motivation is about a previous study's result leading to the current study's purpose. 

Yes, in the example: "Our previous research @@CITATION@@ has shown... the purpose of this work is to try to understand..." which is similar to this case. The cited work's result (successful in model plants) but with a limitation (not in woody species) is motivating the current study's development. 

Therefore, the specific class should be Motivation.
