Okay, let's tackle this classification problem. The user provided a scientific article citation passage and wants me to assign the correct rhetorical class to the citation tagged @@CITATION@@. 

First, I need to follow the steps outlined. Step 1 is to extract the context around the citation. The given passage is:

"Phytoplasma pathogenicity is associated with the production of effector proteins, such as the Phosphate Starvation Inducible (PSI) proteins, which suppress host immune responses. Recent studies have shown that the expression of PSI proteins is regulated by environmental conditions, including nutrient availability @@CITATION@@ and temperature fluctuations @@CITATION@@."

Wait, there are two citations here. But the user's example in the problem mentions only one citation. Hmm, maybe the @@CITATION@@ here refers to both? Or perhaps it's a typo and they want me to consider each citation separately? Wait, the user's instruction says "the citation @@CITATION@@", so maybe in the actual input, only one citation is present. Let me check the original problem again. 

Looking back, the user's example in the problem has a single @@CITATION@@ placeholder. The given passage here has two citations, but perhaps the user intended one of them. Wait, maybe the user's actual input is different. Wait, the user's input here might have a typo. Let me recheck the problem's exact input. 

The user's input is the passage enclosed in backticks:

`"Phytoplasma pathogenicity is associated with the production of effector proteins, such as the Phosphate Starvation Inducible (PSI) proteins, which suppress host immune responses. Recent studies have shown that the expression of PSI proteins is regulated by environmental conditions, including nutrient availability @@CITATION@@ and temperature fluctuations @@CITATION@@."`

So there are two @@CITATION@@ tags here. But the task is to process the citation tagged @@CITATION@@. Since there are two, perhaps the user wants me to process each one? But the problem says "the citation @@CITATION@@", so maybe the example is a bit confusing. Wait, perhaps in the actual problem given to me, there's only one citation. Alternatively, maybe the two citations are part of the same context. Let me see the exact problem again.

Wait, the user's instruction says: "assigns a reference in a scientific article citation passage in the plant health domain to a biological class." But in the current problem, the user provided the passage with two citations. Since the task is about the citation tagged @@CITATION@@, but there are two, perhaps I need to process both, but the user might have intended only one. Alternatively, maybe the two citations are part of the same context, and I should consider them together. 

Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake and included two citations, but the task is to consider each citation separately. Since the problem's example in the user's instructions has only one @@CITATION@@, perhaps I should assume that the correct input here has one. Alternatively, maybe the user wants me to process the first one. 

Alternatively, perhaps the two citations are part of the same context, and the @@CITATION@@ here refers to both. But the task requires assigning a single label to the citation. Hmm, this is a bit confusing, but perhaps I should proceed with the first citation. Alternatively, maybe the user intended the second one. Alternatively, perhaps the entire sentence's context is about the citations. 

Wait, the sentence structure is: "Recent studies have shown that the expression of PSI proteins is regulated by environmental conditions, including nutrient availability @@CITATION@@ and temperature fluctuations @@CITATION@@."

So each citation is supporting a different factor: one for nutrient availability and one for temperature. Each citation is cited in the context of being a recent study showing regulation by those factors. 

Since the task is to classify the citation @@CITATION@@, but there are two, perhaps each citation here is being used to support the statement that PSI proteins are regulated by those factors. The citations are providing support for the claim made in the sentence. 

So, the context for each citation would be that the cited work showed that PSI proteins' expression is regulated by nutrient availability (first citation) and temperature (second). The general intent here is that the citations are supporting the statement made in the current paper. 

Looking at the rhetorical classes, the Support class is when the citation is used to support the citing authors' work. The example given for Support is: "All subscales were consistent with previous research, particularly that of @@CITATION@@...", where the citation supports the current finding. 

In the given context, the sentence says "Recent studies have shown..." followed by the two citations. So the citations are cited as evidence supporting the claim that PSI proteins are regulated by those environmental factors. Therefore, each citation here is providing support for the current paper's statement, so the rhetorical class would be Support. 

Alternatively, maybe Similar? But Similar is when pointing out similarity between cited and citing work. Here, the current paper is using the citations as prior work that supports their statement, so Support is more appropriate. 

Therefore, the answer should be Support.
