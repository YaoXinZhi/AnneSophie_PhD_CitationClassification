Okay, let me tackle this classification task step by step. The user provided a scientific article passage with a citation tagged @@CITATION@@, and I need to determine the rhetorical class of that citation. 

First, I need to follow the steps outlined. The first step is to extract the context discussing the citation. The passage given is:

"Investigations of the impact of plant root exudates on soil microbial communities have revealed significant variations in community structure under different plant species @@CITATION@@. Our study builds on this by examining how these exudates influence nitrogen-fixing bacteria specifically, particularly in arid environments."

So the part around the citation mentions that previous investigations (the cited work) showed variations in soil microbial communities due to plant species. The current study is building on that by looking at nitrogen-fixing bacteria in arid environments.

Next, step two is identifying the general intent. The citation here is referring to prior work that established a foundation. The current study is expanding on that previous finding. The general intent seems to be foundational because the cited work provides the basis for the current research. 

Now, looking at the specific classes. The Basis class is when the citation references the intellectual foundation. The example given is about introducing a method that the current work replicates. Here, the cited work's findings are the basis upon which the current study is built. The phrase "builds on this" directly suggests that the cited work is foundational. 

I should check other possibilities. Could it be Support? The cited work supports the current study's approach, but the key here is that the current study is building upon it, which aligns more with Basis. Support would be if the cited work's results back the current findings, but here it's more about the foundation. 

CoCoGM or similar? No, because they are comparing goals or methods, which isn't the case here. Motivation? The citation is not pointing out a gap but rather a prior result they're extending. Usage? They aren't using a method from the cited work. So Basis seems correct.
