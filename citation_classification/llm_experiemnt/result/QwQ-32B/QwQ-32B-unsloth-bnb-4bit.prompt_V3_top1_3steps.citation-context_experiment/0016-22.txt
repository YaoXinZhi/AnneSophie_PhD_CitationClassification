Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand the user's request. They want me to classify the citation tagged @@CITATION@@ in a given scientific article passage into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. The process involves three main steps: extracting the relevant context, identifying the general intent, and then selecting the specific class.

Starting with Step 1: Extracting the context. The user provided a passage within backticks. Let me look at the example they gave. The passage says, "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." The citation here is referring to a previous description of the experimental setup. The key part here is "described in detail previously," which suggests that the current study is using the setup from the cited work.

Moving to Step 2: Identifying the general intent. The options are Foundational, Comparative, Motivational, Supportive, Technical, Critical/Analytical, or Descriptive. Since the citation is about the experimental setup being described in detail elsewhere, this seems technical. The example given under the 'Usage' class mentions a method or setup being used from the cited work. That fits here because the current paper is utilizing the setup from the cited study.

Step 3: Choosing the specific class. The 'Usage' category is defined as when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup used in the current study. The example provided for Usage is almost identical to the passage given here: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." So this clearly matches the Usage class. 

I should check if there's any other possible class. 'Support' is about supporting the current work's findings, but here it's about the method. 'Basis' would be if it's foundational, but the example doesn't indicate that. 'Technical' intent leads to 'Usage', so that's the right choice. No other classes fit here. The answer should be Usage.
