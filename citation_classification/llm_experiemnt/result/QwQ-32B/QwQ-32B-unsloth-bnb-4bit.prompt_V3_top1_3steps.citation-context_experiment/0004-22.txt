Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to look at the given passage and figure out what the citation is doing there. The user provided the example where the task is to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in a scientific article passage. 

The example passage is: 

"The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@."

Step 1: Extract the context. The relevant part here is "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." So the context is about the experimental setup being described in a prior work.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The sentence is saying that the current study's setup was already detailed in the cited work. This seems like the current paper is using a method or setup from the cited work. 

Looking at the general intent categories, "Technical â†’ Usage" because it's referring to a method or experimental setup used in the current study. 

Step 3: Check the specific classes. The Usage class is defined as when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup from the cited work that is directly used in the current study. The example given for Usage is exactly this scenario: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." So the correct label here should be Usage.
