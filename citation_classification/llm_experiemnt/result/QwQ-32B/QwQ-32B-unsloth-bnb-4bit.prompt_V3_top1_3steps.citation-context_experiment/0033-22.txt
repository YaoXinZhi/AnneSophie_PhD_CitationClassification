Okay, let me tackle this classification problem. The user provided a scientific article citation passage, and I need to determine the rhetorical class of the citation marked @@CITATION@@. 

First, the task is to extract the context around the citation. The example given is:

"Previous studies have shown that magnetic treatment can influence the crystallization process of calcium carbonate @@CITATION@@. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear, prompting our investigation into the effect of magnetic fields on crystal formation."

So, the context here is the sentence containing the citation and the surrounding sentences. The key part here is "Previous studies... @@CITATION@@. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear..." 

Step 1: Extract the context. The relevant part is "Previous studies have shown that magnetic treatment can influence the crystallization process of calcium carbonate @@CITATION@@. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear, prompting our investigation into the effect of magnetic fields on crystal formation." 

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation is referring to previous studies that showed an effect, but the current study is addressing the unclear mechanisms. The second sentence mentions that the mechanisms are unclear, which is why their investigation was prompted. This seems like the citation is used to highlight a gap in existing knowledge, motivating the current research. That would fall under the "Motivational" category, specifically "Motivation" as per the definitions. 

Looking at the definitions:
- Motivation: justifies why the current research is conducted, like identifying a knowledge gap or open question. The example given mentions a previous study that showed something but didn't explain it, leading to the current work's purpose. 

Alternatively, could it be "Future"? But "Future" is for suggesting future directions. Here, the current study is addressing the gap, so it's more about motivating their own work rather than suggesting future research. 

Another angle: the citation supports the need for their study. But "Support" is when the cited work supports the current findings. Here, it's more about the gap motivating their research. 

So the general intent is Motivational, and the specific class is Motivation.
