Okay, let's tackle this classification task step by step. First, I need to look at the given example and the instructions carefully.

The user provided a scientific article passage with a citation marked as @@CITATION@@. My job is to classify that citation into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. The example given is about plant health, so I should keep that context in mind.

Starting with Step 1: Extract the context discussing the citation. The passage provided is:

"In a recent study, @@CITATION@@ demonstrated that the application of silicon nanoparticles significantly enhances disease resistance in wheat plants against Fusarium graminearum. Our research builds on this finding by investigating the molecular mechanisms behind this resistance."

Alright, the relevant part here is "Our research builds on this finding..." which shows that the current study is extending or further exploring the cited work. 

Moving to Step 2: Identify the general intent. The cited work by @@CITATION@@ showed that silicon nanoparticles enhance disease resistance. The current study is building upon that, so the intent here seems foundational. The cited study provides the basis for the current research because they're using that previous result as a starting point to explore more deeply.

Now, looking at the specific classes. The Basis class is when the citation is the intellectual foundation. The example given for Basis mentions replicating previous work. Here, the current research is building on the cited finding, which aligns with Basis because it's the foundation. 

Checking other possibilities: Could it be Support? Support is when the citation backs up the current work's findings. But here, the current work is extending the cited study, not just supporting it. Motivation might be a contender if the citation identifies a knowledge gap, but the phrase "builds on this finding" suggests it's more foundational. Usage would be if they used a method from the cited work, but that's not mentioned here. 

So, the most appropriate class here is Basis.
