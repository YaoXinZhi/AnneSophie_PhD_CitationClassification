Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a citation passage and wants me to classify the citation's rhetorical class. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation @@CITATION@@. The given passage is: "The use of magnetic fields in water treatment has been explored previously, with some studies suggesting reduced scaling @@CITATION@@, while others report no significant effect @@CITATION@@. Our study builds on this conflicting evidence to provide a more comprehensive analysis."

Hmm, the citation here is part of a discussion comparing different studies. The sentence mentions that some studies suggest reduced scaling while others report no effect. The @@CITATION@@ is likely one of those studies being compared. The key part is "while others report no significant effect" which indicates a contrast between the cited works.

Step 2: Determine the general intent. Since they're comparing different results from studies, this is a comparative intent. The specific comparison here is between the results of the cited works. The example given for CoCoRes is about differing results, so that seems right. 

Step 3: Looking at the classes, CoCoRes is for comparing results. The citation is part of a contrast between studies' outcomes. The other comparison classes like CoCoGM (methods/goals) or CoCoXY (explanations) don't fit here because it's about the results differing. So the answer should be CoCoRes.
