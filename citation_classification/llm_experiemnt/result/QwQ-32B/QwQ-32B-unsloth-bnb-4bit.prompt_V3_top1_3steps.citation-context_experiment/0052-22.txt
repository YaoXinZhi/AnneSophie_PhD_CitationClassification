Okay, let's tackle this classification task. The user provided a scientific article passage with a citation tagged @@CITATION@@, and I need to figure out the rhetorical class of that citation. Let me go through the steps carefully.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage given is:

"The role of phytoplasmas in plant diseases has been extensively studied, with previous work showing their association with witches' broom symptoms in various plant species @@CITATION@@. However, the specific mechanisms by which these pathogens induce such symptoms remain poorly understood, prompting our current investigation into the molecular interactions between the host and pathogen."

Alright, so the context here is discussing prior research on phytoplasmas and plant diseases. The citation is mentioned in the first sentence, which states that previous work has shown an association between phytoplasmas and witches' broom symptoms. The next sentence then says that the mechanisms are still not well understood, leading to the current study.

Step 2 is to identify the general intent. The citation here is pointing out prior work that established an association, but the current study is addressing a gap in understanding the mechanisms. That sounds like the citation is used to highlight a knowledge gap, which would fall under Motivational. The example for Motivation mentions identifying a knowledge gap or need, which fits here. The current research is motivated by the existing work's findings but the need to understand more.

Now, looking at the specific rhetorical classes. The options under Motivational are Motivation and Future. The example for Motivation is when the citation justifies the current research by pointing out a gap. Here, the citation is cited to show prior knowledge, then the next part says the mechanisms remain unknown, which is exactly the motivation for the current study. So the specific class should be Motivation.

Wait, but let me check other possibilities. Could it be Basis? The Basis class is when the citation is the foundation. The example for Basis is about replicating results. Here, they are not replicating but building on prior findings to address a gap. So Basis might not fit. Support? If the citation supports their current work, but here it's more about the gap. Support would be if they agree with the cited work's findings. Here, the citation is just stating prior results, then pointing out the gap. So yes, Motivation is the right category. The citation is used to set up the existing knowledge, then the current study is motivated by the lack of understanding of mechanisms. So the answer should be Motivation.
