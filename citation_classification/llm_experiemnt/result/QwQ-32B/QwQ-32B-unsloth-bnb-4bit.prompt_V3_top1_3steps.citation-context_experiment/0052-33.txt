Okay, let's tackle this classification problem. The user provided a passage and wants me to determine the rhetorical class of the citation @@CITATION@@. The passage given is:

"The role of mycorrhizal fungi in enhancing plant resistance to pathogens has been widely documented @@CITATION@@. Our study builds on this by investigating how different fungal species influence the expression of pathogenesis-related genes in host plants under drought stress."

Alright, step by step. First, I need to extract the context discussing the citation. The relevant part here is "The role of mycorrhizal fungi in enhancing plant resistance to pathogens has been widely documented @@CITATION@@." The next sentence says their study builds on this. 

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation is mentioned as something that has documented the role of mycorrhizal fungi. The current study is building upon that prior work. So this seems like the cited work is foundational for their current research. The general intent would be Foundational, leading to the Basis class.

Looking at the definitions, Basis is when the citation references the intellectual foundation. The example given is about replicating previous work. Here, the current study is building on the cited work, which establishes the foundation. So that fits Basis. 

Wait, but let me check other possibilities. Could it be Support? The citation is saying that the role is documented, which supports the importance of the topic. But the next sentence says "Our study builds on this..." which suggests that the cited work is the basis for their current research. So the intent is more foundational than just support. Support would be if they were confirming their results with the citation. Here, it's more about the cited work being the foundation they're building upon. So Basis is the right choice.
