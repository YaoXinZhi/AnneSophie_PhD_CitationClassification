Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user provided a scientific article citation passage and wants me to classify the rhetorical class of the citation marked @@CITATION@@. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The given passage is: 

"The role of mycorrhizal fungi in enhancing plant resistance to soil-borne pathogens has been well-documented @@CITATION@@. Recent studies, however, highlight variations in efficacy depending on fungal species and host plant interactions, a phenomenon not fully explored in previous research."

Step 1: Extract the context discussing the citation. The relevant parts here are "The role of mycorrhizal fungi in enhancing plant resistance to soil-borne pathogens has been well-documented" and the citation. The next sentence mentions recent studies showing variations not explored before. 

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation is supporting the statement that the role is well-documented. The following sentence contrasts with recent findings, but the citation itself is backing the established role. So the intent seems supportive.

Step 3: Choose the specific class. The options under supportive are Support or Similar. The example for Support is when confirming the citing authors' work. Here, the citation supports the statement about the well-documented role, so "Support" fits. The Similar class is when pointing out similarity between cited and current work, which isn't the case here. So the label should be Support.
