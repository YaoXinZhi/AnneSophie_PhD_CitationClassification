Okay, let's tackle this classification problem. The user provided a scientific article passage with a citation tagged as @@CITATION@@, and I need to determine the rhetorical class of that citation. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage given is:

"Investigations of the impact of climate change on plant pathogens have primarily focused on temperature effects @@CITATION@@, yet recent studies highlight the importance of precipitation variability as a critical factor influencing disease prevalence @@CITATION@@. Our study builds on this by examining the combined effects of temperature and precipitation changes on the development of Fusarium wilt in tomato crops."

Wait, there are two citations here. The first one is @@CITATION@@ after "temperature effects", and the second is another citation after "recent studies". But the user is asking about the citation tagged with @@CITATION@@, so maybe the first one? Or perhaps the second? Wait, the user's input might have a specific citation in mind. Let me check again.

Wait, the user's input might have a specific citation context. Wait the user's example shows that the citation in question is @@CITATION@@, but in the given example, there are two citations. Wait, perhaps the user's actual input here is the one provided. Let me re-read the user's message.

Ah, looking at the user's message, the passage is enclosed in backticks. Let me check:

The user's passage is:

`Investigations of the impact of climate change on plant pathogens have primarily focused on temperature effects @@CITATION@@, yet recent studies highlight the importance of precipitation variability as a critical factor influencing disease prevalence @@CITATION@@. Our study builds on this by examining the combined effects of temperature and precipitation changes on the development of Fusarium wilt in tomato crops.`

So there are two citations here. The first @@CITATION@@ is after "temperature effects", and the second is after "recent studies". The user wants to classify the citation tagged @@CITATION@@, but since there are two instances, which one is the target? Wait, maybe the user made a typo, but in their example, perhaps they want to refer to the first or second citation. Wait, the user's instruction says "the citation @@CITATION@@", so maybe in the given text, both are @@CITATION@@, but perhaps in the actual problem, it's one. Wait, perhaps in the actual problem given here, the user has a single citation, but in the example provided, there are two. Wait, maybe I need to look again.

Wait, perhaps the user's input here is a test case where there are two citations, but the task is to process the citation tagged as @@CITATION@@. Let me re-express the user's input. The user provided:

The context is the passage between backticks, which includes two @@CITATION@@ instances. The task is to process the citation tagged as @@CITATION@@, so perhaps the user wants to process each citation separately. But in this case, since the user's example here has two citations, maybe the user expects me to process each? But the problem says "the citation @@CITATION@@", so perhaps in their actual input, there's only one. Wait, perhaps in the example given here, the user wants to process the first citation. Alternatively, maybe the second one. Let me parse the example again.

Wait, the user's example shows that the task is to classify the citation in the context provided. Let me see the exact problem again.

The user's exact input is:

"Extract the context discussing the citation @@CITATION@@, identify general intent, then assign a fine-grained rhetorical class..."

So the context is the entire passage between backticks, which has two citations. But the citation we need to classify is the one marked as @@CITATION@@, so perhaps both instances are @@CITATION@@, but the user wants to process each one? Wait, but in the example given, the user probably wants me to process the first one, but perhaps the second. Let me check the actual text.

Looking at the passage again:

"Investigations of the impact of climate change on plant pathogens have primarily focused on temperature effects @@CITATION@@, yet recent studies highlight the importance of precipitation variability as a critical factor influencing disease prevalence @@CITATION@@. Our study builds on this by examining the combined effects..."

So the first citation is about studies that focused on temperature effects. The second citation is about recent studies highlighting precipitation variability. The task is to classify the @@CITATION@@, but since there are two, perhaps the user intended to have only one, but in this example, there are two. Hmm, this is a problem. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the example, but I need to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps in the actual problem given, there's only one citation. Let me check again the user's input.

Wait, in the user's message, the passage provided has two @@CITATION@@ instances. So maybe I need to process both. However, the problem says "the citation @@CITATION@@", so perhaps each @@CITATION@@ is separate, but in this case, perhaps the user wants to process the first one. Alternatively, perhaps the second citation is the one being discussed here. Let me see.

Wait, the user's example in the task description shows that the citation is part of the context. Let's proceed step by step.

First, step 1: Extract the context discussing the citation @@CITATION@@. Keep only the semantic context useful for understanding the intent.

The passage is:

" Investigations of the impact of climate change on plant pathogens have primarily focused on temperature effects @@CITATION@@, yet recent studies highlight the importance of precipitation variability as a critical factor influencing disease prevalence @@CITATION@@. Our study builds on this by examining the combined effects of temperature and precipitation changes on the development of Fusarium wilt in tomato crops."

So the first citation is after "temperature effects", and the second is after "recent studies". Let's consider the first citation first. The context for the first @@CITATION@@ is "primarily focused on temperature effects @@CITATION@@", so the citation here is referenced in the context that previous studies focused on temperature effects.

The second citation is after "yet recent studies highlight the importance...", so the context is that recent studies (the citation) highlight precipitation variability.

Now, the user wants to classify the citation tagged as @@CITATION@@", so perhaps both are to be considered, but since the user's instruction is to do this for each, but the problem here has two, but the user's task is to process the citation in the given context. Hmm, perhaps the user's example is a mistake, but I have to proceed.

Assuming the first citation: "Investigations... focused on temperature effects @@CITATION@@", so the citation is about studies that focused on temperature effects. The surrounding text says that previous investigations focused on temperature, but recent studies (second citation) highlight precipitation. Then the current study builds on this (the recent studies) to look at both factors.

So for the first citation: The context is that prior work focused on temperature. The current study is moving towards considering precipitation, but the first citation is about temperature studies. The current study is building on the recent studies (second citation) perhaps.

The task is to classify the first citation. Let's see:

The general intent: The first citation is mentioned in the context that previous studies focused on temperature effects. The current study is building on recent studies (the second citation) that highlight precipitation. So the first citation is part of the existing literature that the current study is moving beyond. The mention of the first citation might be to establish the basis of prior work, but then contrast with recent studies.

Alternatively, the first citation is foundational, but the current study is moving beyond it. Or perhaps the first citation is part of the basis, but the second is more recent. However, the first citation's context is that prior work focused on temperature, so the current study is moving towards precipitation, but the first citation is part of the existing literature. The mention here is to state that previous work focused on temperature, but now recent studies (second citation) highlight precipitation. So the first citation is part of the existing foundation, but the current work is building on the recent studies. So for the first citation, the intent might be foundational (Basis), because it's stating that prior work was on temperature. The current study might be building on the recent studies (second citation), but the first citation is the basis of prior work.

Alternatively, the first citation is just describing prior work, so maybe Neutral? Or maybe it's part of a comparison with the recent studies. Let's see the definitions.

Looking at the classes:

Basis: the citation references the intellectual foundation of the current research.

In this case, the first citation is about prior studies that focused on temperature. The current study is building on the recent studies (second citation) that highlight precipitation. So the first citation might not be the basis for the current study, but rather prior work that the current study is moving beyond. The basis would be the recent studies (second citation) since the current study builds on that. So for the first citation, perhaps it's just descriptive, stating that previous work focused on temperature, so the intent is descriptive, which would be Neutral. But let's check the Neutral example: "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@." So that's a neutral statement. Here, the first citation is used to state that prior work focused on temperature. It's not supporting, comparing, or motivating. It's just stating a fact about prior work. Therefore, Neutral might be the general intent here.

Alternatively, maybe it's part of a comparison between the prior focus on temperature and the recent focus on precipitation. Let's see the Comparative intents (CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY). The first citation is part of the prior work, and the second citation is recent studies. The current paper is building on the recent studies. The mention of the first citation could be to contrast with the recent studies. For example, "prior studies focused on X, but recent studies (citation) highlight Y, so we build on that." In this case, the first citation is part of a comparative context between prior and recent studies, so maybe CoCoGM or CoCoRes?

Wait, the Comparative intent includes CoCoGM (comparison of goals/methods), CoCoRes (comparison of results), CoCoXY (compare explanations or claims between two cited works). Let's see:

The first citation's context is that previous work focused on temperature, while recent studies (second citation) highlight precipitation. The current study builds on the recent studies. So the first citation and the second are being contrasted. The first is about temperature focus, the second is precipitation. So the first citation is part of a comparison between the two studies (the cited works) in terms of their focus. Since the current paper is contrasting the two, perhaps this is a CoCoGM (comparison of goals or methods) between the two cited works (first and second citations). However, the second citation is also a @@CITATION@@. Wait, but in the problem, the user is asking to classify the citation @@CITATION@@", which in this case, if we're considering the first citation, then the comparison is between the first and second citations, so that would be CoCoGM or CoCoXY. But the user's example here is a bit ambiguous because there are two citations. Maybe the user intended only one citation, but in their example, they have two. Alternatively, perhaps the citation in question is the second one.

Let me check the second citation: "yet recent studies highlight the importance of precipitation variability as a critical factor influencing disease prevalence @@CITATION@@", so the second citation is the recent studies that highlight precipitation. The current study builds on this. So the intent here for the second citation might be Motivation, because the current study is motivated by the recent findings of precipitation's importance. Alternatively, the second citation is providing the basis for the current study's motivation. Or maybe Support, because it supports the current study's approach. Let's see.

The example for Motivation: "Our previous research @@CITATION@@ has shown that the formation of the hard calcite scale on the surfaces exposed to hard water can be successfully prevented with the applied magnetic field. The explanation of the phenomena is not yet offered and the purpose of this work is to try to understand the mechanism of the beneficial influence of the magnetic treatment." So Motivation is when the cited work justifies why the current research is being done. Here, the recent studies (second citation) highlight precipitation variability as important, so the current study is building on that, which could be Motivation: the cited work (second citation) is the reason why the current study is done, to examine combined effects. So the second citation would be Motivation.

Alternatively, if the citation is the second one, the intent would be Motivation. But the user's example here has two citations, so perhaps I need to clarify which one is being referred to. Since the problem says "the citation @@CITATION@@", and in the example given by the user, there are two instances, perhaps the user intended only one, but in their example, it's a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I should process both.

Wait, perhaps the user's actual input is different, but in the problem presented here, the user provided a passage with two citations. But the task requires processing the @@CITATION@@, so perhaps the user wants me to process each citation separately. Let me proceed with the first citation first.

First citation: @@CITATION@@ after "temperature effects".

Step 1: Extract context. The sentence says that prior investigations focused on temperature effects (citation), but recent studies (second citation) highlight precipitation. The first citation is cited in the context of previous work's focus. The intent here is to state that prior work focused on temperature. The general intent could be Neutral (just describing prior work), or perhaps it's part of a comparative context with the second citation. Since the sentence contrasts the two (prior focused on temperature, recent on precipitation), the first citation is part of a comparison between the two cited works. That would be a Comparative intent. Specifically, comparing the goals or methods of the two studies (first and second citations). So the first citation's intent is Comparative, specifically CoCoGM (Comparison of Goals/Methods), because the first study's focus (temperature) is compared with the second's (precipitation). But the user's task is to classify the @@CITATION@@, which in this case is the first one. The comparison is between the two citations, so this would be CoCoGM or CoCoXY.

Looking at CoCoXY definition: "the citation is used to compare or contrast two cited studies with each other — not with the citing paper." So if the current paper is contrasting the two cited studies, then that's CoCoXY. But in this case, the current paper is building on the recent studies (second citation), so the first citation is part of a contrast with the second. Since the current paper is comparing the two citations, that's CoCoGM (if comparing their goals) or CoCoRes (if comparing results). Since the first citation's focus is temperature, the second's is precipitation variability, so the comparison is about their goals or focus areas (temperature vs precipitation), so that's CoCoGM.

Alternatively, if the current paper is pointing out that the first study focused on temperature, while the second on precipitation, so they have different goals/methods, then the first citation is being compared with the second, so the classification for the first would be CoCoGM. However, the task is to classify each citation separately. The first citation's context is part of a comparative statement with the second citation. So the first citation's role is to set up a contrast with the second. So the first citation's intent is part of a comparative context between the two cited works, so the rhetorical class for the first citation would be CoCoGM.

But let's check the example for CoCoXY: "Fast multiplication rates... Wei et al., 2004; Saracco et al., 2006), although conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima @@CITATION@@." Here, two studies are compared, and the third is contrasted. In our case, the two citations are being contrasted in their focuses. The first citation (temperature) and second (precipitation). The current paper is pointing out that the first focused on temperature, the second on precipitation. So the first citation's context is part of a comparison between the two cited works, so that's CoCoGM (since it's about their goals or methods). The comparison is between the two cited studies' goals (temperature vs precipitation). So the first citation's intent is CoCoGM.

Alternatively, since the current paper is building on the recent studies (second citation), perhaps the first citation is just stating prior work, which is the basis, but the basis would be the recent studies. Hmm.

Alternatively, the first citation is just stating prior work, so maybe Neutral. Let me check the Neutral example: "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@." That's a neutral statement. Here, the first citation is stating that prior work focused on temperature, which is a fact without any comparative intent in the citation itself. Wait, but the sentence is contrasting the two citations. The first part says prior focused on temperature, the second says recent highlight precipitation. So the first citation is part of a comparative context with the second citation. Therefore, the intent is Comparative (CoCoGM).

Alternatively, the first citation is part of a basis, but the basis is the foundation for the current study. Since the current study is building on the recent studies (second citation), the first citation isn't the basis but a contrast. So the first citation's role is comparative with the second, so CoCoGM.

Alternatively, maybe the first citation is Basis, because it's prior work. But the current study isn't building on it, so it's not the basis. The basis would be the second citation. Therefore, the first citation's intent is Comparative (CoCoGM).

Therefore, the first citation's label would be CoCoGM. The second citation's context is that recent studies highlight precipitation, and the current study builds on this, so the second citation's intent is Motivation (since it's the reason for the current study's focus).

But the user's question is about the citation tagged @@CITATION@@", which in the given example has two instances. Since the user's problem is to process the @@CITATION@@, perhaps the user intended only one citation, but in their example, they have two. Maybe I should consider the second citation as the one to classify. Let me try that.

Second citation: @@CITATION@@ after "recent studies highlight... precipitation variability..."

The context here is that the recent studies (citation) highlight precipitation variability, and the current study builds on this. So the cited work's findings (precipitation importance) are the basis for the current study's motivation. The current study is motivated by the cited work's results. Therefore, the intent here is Motivation. The example for Motivation is: "Our previous research @@CITATION@@ has shown that... The explanation... is not yet offered and the purpose of this work is to try to understand..." So similar to this, the recent studies' findings (citation) are the motivation for the current study's investigation. So the second citation would be Motivation.

Alternatively, maybe the current study's basis is the cited work, so Basis? But Basis is about the intellectual foundation. If the current study builds on that, then Basis could be possible. Let me check the Basis example: "introduced and validated the IAT... We began by replicating these inoffensive results..." So Basis is when the current work is building on the cited work's foundation. Here, the current study is building on the recent studies' findings about precipitation, so that could be Basis. But the example for Basis is about replicating their results. Here, the current study is examining combined effects, so maybe it's building on the basis provided by the cited work (precipitation's importance). Alternatively, the cited work's findings provide the motivation for the current study to look into combined effects. So it's more of a Motivation.

The Motivation class is for justifying why the current research is conducted, like identifying a knowledge gap or new findings that prompt the current work. Since the recent studies highlighted precipitation's importance, the current study is motivated to look at both factors, so Motivation is appropriate.

Therefore, if the citation in question is the second one, the label would be Motivation. But the user's problem has two citations, so perhaps the user intended to have only one. Let me re-examine the original problem again.

Wait, the user's instruction says: "the citation @@CITATION@@ in a scientific article passage delimited by backticks." The passage provided has two @@CITATION@@ instances. This might be an error, but I have to proceed with the given text. Since the user's task is to classify each citation, but the problem requires only one label, perhaps the user intended the second citation. Alternatively, maybe the first citation is the one to be classified, but the second is part of the context.

Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake and there should be only one citation. Let me try to see which one is more likely. Let's look at the example given in the task description for CoCoGM: "Most closely related to this paper is concurrent work by @@CITATION@@ who propose a method to 'debias' word embeddings. Our work is complementary, as we focus instead on rigorously demonstrating human-like biases in word embeddings." Here, the citation is being compared to the current work's goals/methods, so that's CoCoGM. In the user's example, the first citation is part of a contrast between prior and recent studies, so the first citation's intent would be CoCoGM if it's part of a comparison with the second citation. 

Alternatively, if the first citation is the one to be classified, then the answer would be CoCoGM. The second citation's intent is Motivation. But since the problem requires only one label, perhaps the user intended only one citation. Maybe the user's example had a typo, and the first citation is the only one. Let me check the exact problem again.

Wait, the user's passage is:

`Investigations of the impact of climate change on plant pathogens have primarily focused on temperature effects @@CITATION@@, yet recent studies highlight the importance of precipitation variability as a critical factor influencing disease prevalence @@CITATION@@. Our study builds on this by examining the combined effects of temperature and precipitation changes on the development of Fusarium wilt in tomato crops.`

So the two citations are in the same sentence. The first is about prior focus on temperature, the second about recent studies on precipitation. The current study builds on "this" (the recent studies). 

Therefore, the first citation's role is to state prior work, while the second is the basis for the current study. The first citation's context is part of a comparative statement between the two studies, so its intent is Comparative (CoCoGM). The second's intent is Motivation or Basis. 

Assuming the user wants to classify both, but since the task is to return one label, perhaps the citation in question is the second one. Let me proceed with the second citation first.

Second citation: "recent studies highlight... precipitation variability @@CITATION@@", and the current study builds on this. So the cited work's findings are the reason why the current study is being done. That's Motivation. 

Alternatively, the basis: since the current study builds on their work, perhaps Basis. Let me check the Basis example again. The Basis example is when the current work replicates or builds on the cited work's foundational work. Here, the current study is examining combined effects, which is an extension of the cited work's focus on precipitation. So maybe Basis is appropriate. But the example for Basis is about replicating results. Here, it's building upon, so perhaps Motivation is better because it's the motivation to study combined effects due to the cited work's findings on precipitation's importance.

Therefore, the second citation would be Motivation. 

Alternatively, if the first citation is the one to classify, then the answer is CoCoGM.

But since the user's problem has two citations, but the task requires one label, perhaps I need to re-express the problem. Alternatively, maybe the user intended the citation to be the second one, so the answer is Motivation. 

Alternatively, perhaps the first citation is part of the basis of prior work, so Basis. Let me think again. The first citation is about prior studies focusing on temperature. The current study is not building on those, but on the recent studies. Therefore, the first citation's role is to state prior work, but not the basis. The basis would be the second citation. So for the first citation, it's Neutral? Because it's just stating a fact about prior work without any comparative or other intent beyond description. Wait, but the sentence contrasts the two citations: "focused on temperature effects @@CITATION@@", "yet recent studies highlight precipitation @@CITATION@@", so the first is part of a comparison between prior and recent studies, so the intent is Comparative (CoCoGM).

So, if the user is asking about the first citation, the label is CoCoGM. The second citation would be Motivation. Since the problem requires only one label, perhaps the first citation is the one in question, but I'm not sure. Since the user's problem statement has two citations, but the instructions say "the citation @@CITATION@@", maybe the user intended only one citation in the actual problem, and this is a mistake. To resolve this ambiguity, perhaps I should choose the second citation as the intended one, leading to Motivation.

Alternatively, perhaps the user's actual intended citation is the second one, given that the current study builds on it. Therefore, the answer is Motivation.

Wait, let me re-express the sentence:

The current study builds on "this", referring to the recent studies (second citation). So the second citation's work is the basis for the current study. So "builds on this" implies that the cited work (second) is the basis. So the second citation would be Basis.

Wait, the Basis example: "introduced and validated the IAT... We began by replicating these inoffensive results..." So Basis is when the current work builds on the cited work's foundation. Here, the current study builds on the cited work (second citation), so that would be Basis.

But the example for Motivation is when the cited work is the reason for the current study's existence. Here, the current study is motivated by the cited work's findings, so it's a bit of both. Let me think again.

The sentence says: "Our study builds on this by examining..." where "this" refers to the recent studies' findings on precipitation. So the cited work (second citation) is the basis for the current study's approach. Therefore, the second citation is Basis.

Alternatively, "builds on this" could mean that the current study is extending the cited work's findings, so that's Basis. The example for Basis is about replicating results, but here it's building upon, so Basis is appropriate.

Therefore, the second citation's intent is Basis. 

Wait, but the first citation's intent would be CoCoGM, but if the user is asking about the second citation, then the answer is Basis.

Hmm, this is getting confusing. Let me try to summarize:

First citation: @@CITATION@@ after "temperature effects" → context is prior work focused on temperature. The sentence contrasts this with recent studies (second citation) on precipitation. The current study builds on the recent studies. 

The first citation's role is to set up that prior work was on temperature, but recent work (second citation) is on precipitation, which the current study builds on. So the first citation's intent is to compare with the second, so CoCoGM (comparing goals/methods between the two studies). The second citation's intent is Basis (the current study builds on it). 

Since the problem requires only one label, perhaps the user intended the second citation, so the answer would be Basis. Alternatively, the first citation's answer is CoCoGM.

But without knowing which citation the user is referring to, it's ambiguous. However, since the task is to assign to the citation @@CITATION@@", and there are two instances, perhaps the user intended the second one. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake and there's only one citation. Let me check the original problem again.

Wait, perhaps the user's actual input has only one citation, but in the example provided here, it's written with two. Maybe I should assume that the citation in question is the second one. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user's example has a typo, and the second citation is not @@CITATION@@", but the first is the only one. In that case, the first citation's intent is Neutral or CoCoGM.

Alternatively, perhaps the user's actual problem is different, but given the information, I'll proceed with the second citation as the intended one, leading to Basis or Motivation.

Wait, the sentence says "Our study builds on this by examining..." where "this" refers to the recent studies' findings (second citation). So the second citation is the basis for the current study's work. Therefore, the rhetorical class is Basis.

Therefore, the label for the second citation is Basis.

Alternatively, if the citation is the first one, it's CoCoGM. 

Since the problem is ambiguous but the user's example shows two citations, but the task requires one label, I'll proceed with the second citation as the intended one, leading to Basis.

Wait, but the Basis example is when the current work replicates or builds on the cited work's foundational work. Here, the current study builds on the cited work's findings, so Basis is appropriate.

Alternatively, the second citation's intent is Support, since it supports the current study's approach. Let me check Support's definition: "the citation is used to support, or confirm the work, result or finding of the citing authors." Here, the cited work's findings (precipitation is important) supports the current study's decision to examine combined effects. So maybe Support.

Wait, the example for Support is: "All subscales were consistent with previous research, particularly that of @@CITATION@@ also using a U.S. sample..." So Support is when the cited work's results are in line with the current study's findings. In our case, the current study is building on the cited work's findings, so it's more of a basis than support. Support would be if the cited work's results support the current study's results. Here, the cited work's findings motivate the current study's research direction. So Motivation is better.

Hmm. Let me think again. The current study is motivated by the recent findings (second citation) about precipitation's importance. The cited work shows that precipitation is important, so the current study's aim to look at combined effects is motivated by that. Therefore, the citation is used to motivate the current research, hence Motivation.

Yes, that makes sense. The second citation provides the motivation for the current study's investigation, so the answer is Motivation.

Therefore, if the citation in question is the second one, the label is Motivation.

Since the user's problem has two citations, but the task requires one label, I'll assume the second citation is the one intended, so the answer is Motivation.
</think>

Motivation
