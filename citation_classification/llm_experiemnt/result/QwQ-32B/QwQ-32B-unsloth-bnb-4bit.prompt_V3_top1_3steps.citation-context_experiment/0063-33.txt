Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand the task. The user provided a citation passage and wants me to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. The steps are: extract the context around the citation, identify the general intent, and then choose the specific class.

The example given is the passage: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." 

Starting with Step 1: Extract the context discussing the citation. The sentence here is straightforward. The key part is "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." The context here is that the current study is referring to a prior work where the experimental setup was detailed. The main point is that the setup is being referenced from a previous study.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The sentence is stating that the current work is using a previously described experimental setup. This sounds like the citation is being used to reference a method or procedure that's being utilized in the current study. Looking at the general intent categories, "Technical" would correspond to Usage, since Usage is when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or setup used in the current study.

Step 3: Select the specific class. The example's sentence exactly matches the Usage example provided: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." The example for Usage is the same structure. Therefore, the correct label here is Usage.
