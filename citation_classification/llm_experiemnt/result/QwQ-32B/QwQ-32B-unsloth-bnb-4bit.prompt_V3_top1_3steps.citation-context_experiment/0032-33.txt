Okay, let's tackle this classification problem. The user provided a scientific article passage with a citation tagged @@CITATION@@, and I need to determine the rhetorical class of that citation. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage given is: 

"In recent studies, the role of mycorrhizal fungi in enhancing plant drought tolerance has been extensively explored. However, the mechanisms underlying this interaction remain unclear. A previous study @@CITATION@@ demonstrated that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can improve water uptake in wheat plants under drought conditions. Building on this work, our study investigates the physiological pathways involved in this process."

Step 1: Extract the context discussing the citation. The relevant part here is: "A previous study @@CITATION@@ demonstrated that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can improve water uptake in wheat plants under drought conditions. Building on this work, our study investigates the physiological pathways involved in this process." This part directly references the cited work and explains how the current study builds upon it.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The current study is building on the cited work, which previously demonstrated a certain effect. The citation here is used to show that prior research established a finding, and the current work is extending that by looking into the mechanisms. This seems like the cited work is foundational because it's the basis for the current research. Alternatively, it could be "Motivation" if the cited study identified a knowledge gap. But the phrase "Building on this work" suggests that the cited study's findings are the foundation, and the current work is an extension. 

Looking at the definitions:
- Basis: the citation references the intellectual foundation. The example given is about replicating previous work. Here, they are building on it, so maybe Basis fits.
- Motivation: if the cited work points out a gap, but the example here says the cited work demonstrated something, so the current work is expanding on that result. 

Alternatively, "Support" could be if they are confirming the cited result, but here they are moving forward with more investigation. 

Step 3: Choose the specific class. The key phrase is "Building on this work," which indicates that the cited study's findings are the basis for the current study's investigation. Therefore, the cited work is the foundational basis. So the label should be Basis.
