Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. The user provided a scientific article passage with a citation tagged as @@CITATION@@, and I need to determine the rhetorical class of that citation.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage says: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." 

Step 1: The context here is straightforward. The authors are stating that their experimental setup was previously detailed in the cited work. The key phrase here is "described in detail previously," which suggests that they are referring to a prior description of their methods.

Step 2: To identify the general intent, I need to see why the citation is mentioned. Since they're talking about the experimental setup, this is likely referring to a method or procedure used in their current study. The general intent here seems to be "Technical" because they're using a method from the cited work.

Step 3: Now, looking at the specific classes. The example given for "Usage" is exactly this scenario: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." The predefined example for Usage matches this context. The citation is pointing out that the current study used a method, tool, dataset, or setup from the cited work. 

So, the most appropriate label here is "Usage".
