Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user provided a scientific article passage with a citation tagged as @@CITATION@@, and I need to classify the rhetorical class of that citation. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage given is:

"In contrast to previous studies that focused on above-ground symptoms, our research highlights the role of root colonization in disease progression. This root-centric approach differs from earlier work @@CITATION@@, which primarily examined leaf symptoms in isolation."

Alright, so the context here is discussing a contrast between the current study's focus on root colonization and previous studies, specifically the cited work, which looked at leaf symptoms. The key part here is "in contrast to previous studies... our research... differs from earlier work @@CITATION@@, which primarily examined leaf symptoms in isolation."

Next, I need to identify the general intent of the citation. The citation is pointing out that the cited work focused on leaf symptoms, while the current study is different because it looks at roots. This seems like a comparison between the current study's methods or goals and the cited work's methods or goals. 

Looking at the general intent categories, Comparative would be the right bucket here because they are comparing their approach to the cited work. Now, diving into the specific rhetorical classes under Comparative: CoCoGM (Comparison of Goals or Methods), CoCoRes (Comparison of Results), or CoCoXY (Comparison of Explanations or Claims). 

The example for CoCoGM is when the citation compares the methods or goals. Here, the current study's root-centric approach is contrasted with the cited work's focus on leaf symptoms. That's a difference in the methods or the aspects they're studying (goals). The citation is highlighting that their study's method (focusing on roots) is different from the cited work's method (looking at leaves). So this seems like a comparison of goals or methods, hence CoCoGM.

Wait, but let me check if it's CoCoRes. CoCoRes is about comparing results. But in the example given for CoCoRes, they talk about differing results. Here, the difference is in what they studied (methods/goals), not the results. The current study's result is about root role, while the cited work's result was about leaf symptoms. But the context here is more about the approach (methods/goals) rather than the actual results. So yes, CoCoGM is the right one here.

So the final label should be CoCoGM.

CoCoGM
