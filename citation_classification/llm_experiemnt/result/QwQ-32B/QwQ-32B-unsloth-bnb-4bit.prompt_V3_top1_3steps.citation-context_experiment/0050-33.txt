Okay, let's tackle this classification. The user provided a citation in a plant health context and wants me to determine its rhetorical class. The example given is about phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The example context says: "Fast multiplication rates and high concentration of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains have been reported in young developing leaves and roots of infected daisy plants (Wei et al., 2004; Saracco et al., 2006), although conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima @@CITATION@@."

Step 1: The context mentions that there are conflicting results between the cited works (Wei and Saracco) and another study on Euphorbia. The citation here is对比 different studies' findings.

Step 2: The general intent seems Comparative. Looking at the Comparative subclasses, CoCoXY is for comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies. Here, the citation is pointing out conflicting results between the previous studies, not comparing with the current paper's work. 

So the specific class should be CoCoXY because it's contrasting two cited studies' results.
