Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user provided a scientific article passage with a citation tagged @@CITATION@@, and I need to classify the rhetorical class of that citation. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage given is: 

"In recent studies, the impact of drought on plant health has been extensively researched. However, the role of microbial communities in mitigating drought stress remains understudied @@CITATION@@. Our study aims to fill this gap by investigating the interactions between root microbiota and plant resilience under water-limited conditions."

Step 1: Extract the context discussing the citation. The relevant part here is: "the role of microbial communities in mitigating drought stress remains understudied @@CITATION@@." The citation is immediately following a statement about a research gap.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The sentence mentions that the role is "understudied" and the current study aims to "fill this gap." This suggests that the citation is pointing out a knowledge gap that motivates the current research. That points towards the Motivational category.

Step 3: Choose the specific rhetorical class. Looking at the options under Motivational, there's "Motivation" and "Future." The example for Motivation is about justifying the research by a knowledge gap, which fits here. The citation here is used to justify why the current study is necessary, so "Motivation" is the right choice. "Future" is more about suggesting future directions, which isn't exactly the case here. The citation isn't suggesting future work but is explaining the motivation for the current study.
