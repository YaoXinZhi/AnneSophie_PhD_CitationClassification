Okay, let me tackle this step by step. First, I need to look at the given passage and figure out the context around the citation @@CITATION@@. The user provided the example where the task is to classify the citation's rhetorical class. The example given in the problem is about a study where conflicting results are mentioned between two previous studies. 

The example passage says: "Fast multiplication rates and high concentration of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains have been reported in young developing leaves and roots of infected daisy plants (Wei et al., 2004; Saracco et al., 2006), although conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima @@CITATION@@."

Step 1 is to extract the context discussing the citation. Here, the sentence mentions that while previous studies (Wei and Saracco) reported certain findings, the citation refers to conflicting results from another study. The key part here is the comparison between the cited works, pointing out that their results are conflicting.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. Since the citation is used to compare or contrast two cited studies (the first two and the one at @@CITATION@@), this falls under comparative. Looking at the subclasses, CoCoXY is for comparing explanations or claims between cited studies. The example given for CoCoXY matches this scenario where conflicting results between studies are highlighted.

Step 3: The specific class here is CoCoXY because it's comparing the results (explanations or claims) of the cited works with each other, not with the current paper. The main point is the conflict between the studies, so the answer should be CoCoXY.
