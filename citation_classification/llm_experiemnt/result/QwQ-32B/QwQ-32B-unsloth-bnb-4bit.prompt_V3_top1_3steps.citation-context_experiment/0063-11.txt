Okay, let me tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand the task properly. The user wants me to classify a citation in a scientific article into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. The citation is tagged as @@CITATION@@, and the passage is given in backticks. 

The process involves three main steps: extracting the relevant context around the citation, identifying the general intent, and then selecting the specific rhetorical class based on the definitions provided.

Starting with the given example, the user provided a passage and an example classification. Let me look at the example they gave. The citation context is: 

"The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@."

The example output is "Usage" because the citation refers to a method or setup used in the current study. That makes sense because the definition for Usage states it's when a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup from the cited work is directly used.

Now, applying this to the current problem. Let's see the user's input. Wait, actually, in the user's message, they provided the general task and the definitions, but the actual passage and citation context to analyze isn't here. Wait, no—the user's message is the entire query, and the example they provided is part of the instructions. Wait, perhaps the user is providing a test case? Let me check again.

Looking back, the user's message includes the context, task, steps, definitions, and output format. But the actual problem they want me to solve might be in the example they gave? Wait, no, perhaps the user is asking for me to process a specific citation passage, but in their message, they only provided the example. Wait, maybe there's a confusion here. Wait, in the user's message, the example given is part of the problem setup. The actual task for me is to process a specific citation passage provided by the user. But in the current query, the user hasn't provided a new citation passage beyond the example. Wait, perhaps I need to re-examine the exact input.

Wait, the user's message is structured as follows: They start by describing the task, the steps, the definitions, and the output format. The example they provided is part of the definitions. However, the actual problem they want me to solve isn't presented here. Wait, maybe the user is providing an example scenario where they want me to apply this classification. Wait, perhaps they made a mistake and didn't include the actual citation passage. Wait, no. Let me check again.

Looking at the user's message again, the very last part says: 

#OUTPUT FORMAT

Think step by step. Return only one label from the list above (Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Motivation, Future, Support, Similar, Usage, Weakness, Neutral).

Wait, so perhaps the user is providing a test case where the citation passage is the one in the example under "Usage" (the experimental setup one), and they want me to go through the steps and output the label. But the user hasn't provided a new citation passage. Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps the user is presenting a scenario where the citation context is the example given under Usage, and they want me to process that example. Let me see the example under Usage:

Example: “The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@.”

So in that case, the task would be to process that example and return "Usage" as the label, which the example already states. But since the user is asking me to do the process, perhaps they want me to walk through the steps for that example. Alternatively, maybe there's a missing part where the user provided a new citation passage but it's not visible here. Wait, looking at the user's message again, the actual problem they are presenting is the one in the example, but they might be testing if I can apply the steps correctly. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Wait, perhaps the user is asking me to apply this process to a specific citation passage that they have included in their message. Let me check again.

Wait, in the user's message, they have a section that says:

"Below are the fined-grained rhetorical class definitions and examples."

Then under each class, there are examples, including the Usage example with the experimental setup. The user's actual problem is perhaps to process that example and confirm the label, but since they included the example, maybe they want me to process another example. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The user's message is the entire setup for the problem, and they want me to take the example they provided (the one with the experimental setup) and process it step by step to arrive at the correct label. But since they already provided the example with the correct label, maybe this is a test to see if I can follow the steps. Alternatively, perhaps the user forgot to include the actual citation passage they want classified. 

Wait, looking back at the initial problem statement, the user says:

"You are a classifier that assigns a reference in a scientific article citation passage in the plant health domain to a biological class. The biological class represents the biological information highlighted by the reference in the citation passage."

Wait, but then the task is about rhetorical classes, not biological classes. Maybe there's a mix-up here. Alternatively, perhaps the user is providing a template for a question, and I need to apply the process to the example given in the Usage class's example. Let me proceed under that assumption, since otherwise there's no specific citation passage provided here. 

Alternatively, perhaps this is a mistake, and the user intended to include a citation passage but forgot. Since I can't proceed without that, maybe I should ask for clarification. But given that the user's message ends with the output format and instructions, perhaps the example they provided under Usage is the one to process. Let's proceed with that example.

So the citation passage in the Usage example is: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@."

Step 1: Extract the context discussing the citation. The entire sentence is the context, which says that the experimental setup was described before, so the citation is pointing to a prior work that detailed the setup.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. Since the citation is referring to a method or experimental setup used in the current study, the general intent is Technical, which maps to the Usage class.

Step 3: The specific rhetorical class is Usage, as per the example.

Therefore, the correct label is "Usage".

Alternatively, if the user intended to present another example, but in the current setup, since they only provided the example for Usage, that's the one to use. Alternatively, maybe there's another example in the Weakness section. Let me check the Weakness example:

Example: “Eighteen species, collected on cultivated and wild pear, were described from China @@CITATION@@. The taxonomic status of these species is problematic and some may not develop on Pyrus.”

Here, the citation is used to criticize or point out limitations, so the label would be Weakness. But since the user's example under Usage is the one they explicitly mentioned in the task, perhaps that's the case to use here.

Alternatively, maybe the user is providing all this information and wants me to apply it to a different example they have in mind, but it's not here. Since the problem is presented as a classifier setup, perhaps this is a test to see if I can correctly apply the steps to a given example. Since the user hasn't provided a new citation passage, I might need to ask for more information, but given the constraints, I'll proceed with the example given in the Usage section and confirm that the correct label is Usage.
