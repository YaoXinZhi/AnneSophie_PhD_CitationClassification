Okay, let's tackle this classification problem step by step. The user provided a scientific article citation passage and wants me to assign the correct rhetorical class to the citation marked @@CITATION@@. 

First, I need to follow the steps outlined. Starting with Step 1: Extract the context discussing the citation. The given passage is within backticks, so I should look for the part that's around the @@CITATION@@ tag. The example given here is:

"The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@."

Hmm, so the context here is "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." That's pretty straightforward. The sentence is saying that the setup they used was already detailed in a previous work, which is the cited paper.

Moving to Step 2: Identify the general intent. The options are Foundational, Comparative, Motivational, Supportive, Technical, Critical/Analytical, or Descriptive. 

In this case, the sentence is stating that the current study's experimental setup was described in detail in the cited work. The cited work here is being referenced as a source for the method or setup used. That sounds like the cited work provided the method or setup that the current paper is using. 

Looking at the technical category, which maps to the "Usage" class. The Usage definition says it's when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup from the cited work that is directly used in the current study. The example given for Usage is exactly similar: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." So this seems to fit perfectly under Usage.

Step 3: Select the specific rhetorical class. Since the general intent is Technical, the corresponding label is Usage. Let me double-check the definitions again to be sure. The Support class is for supporting the current findings, but here it's about using the setup from the cited work, not supporting a claim. Usage is definitely the right one here.
