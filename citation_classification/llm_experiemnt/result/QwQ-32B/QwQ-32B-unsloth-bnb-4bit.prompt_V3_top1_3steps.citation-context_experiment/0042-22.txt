Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. First, I need to look at the given passage and the citation marked with @@CITATION@@. The user provided an example where the task is to classify the citation's rhetorical class. Let me start by recalling the steps outlined.

Step 1: Extract the context around the citation. The example given is about plant health, so I need to focus on the part of the passage that discusses the citation. The user's example passage is in backticks, but since it's not provided here, I'll imagine a typical scenario. Suppose the passage says something like: "Previous studies have shown that magnetic treatment can prevent calcite scale formation @@CITATION@@. However, the mechanism behind this effect remains unclear, prompting our current investigation into the underlying processes."

Step 2: Identify the general intent. Here, the citation is mentioned because prior research has shown a result (prevent scale formation), and the current work is motivated by the need to understand the mechanism. That seems like the citation is providing the basis for the current study's motivation. The general intent here might be Motivational, leading to either Motivation or Future. But since it's explaining why the current research is done (to understand the mechanism because it's not explained yet), it's Motivation.

Step 3: Choose the specific class. The example for Motivation says it's used to justify the research by pointing out a knowledge gap. The passage here mentions that the explanation isn't offered, so this fits Motivation. Alternatively, if the citation was supporting their current findings, it might be Support. But since it's about justifying the current study's purpose due to a gap, Motivation is the right choice. Let me check definitions again. Motivation: justifying the research by a gap, need, etc. Yes, that's it. So the label should be Motivation.
