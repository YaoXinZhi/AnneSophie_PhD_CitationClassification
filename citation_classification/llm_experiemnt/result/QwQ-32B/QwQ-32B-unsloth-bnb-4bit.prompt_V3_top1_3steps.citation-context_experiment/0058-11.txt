Okay, let's tackle this classification problem. The user provided a scientific article passage with a citation tagged @@CITATION@@, and I need to figure out which rhetorical class it belongs to. Let me start by following the steps outlined.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage given is:

"The use of magnetic fields to inhibit scale formation in water systems has been studied for decades. Previous work demonstrated that magnetically treated water reduces scale deposition by 40% under static conditions @@CITATION@@. However, dynamic flow experiments in real pipelines showed no significant effect @@CITATION@@. This discrepancy motivates our investigation into the mechanisms behind these conflicting results."

The citation here is the second one, right? Wait, the user's example has two citations, but the task is about the one marked @@CITATION@@. Let me check again. Oh, in the provided text, both citations are marked as @@CITATION@@? Wait no, looking at the user's input, the actual passage is enclosed in backticks. Let me parse it again carefully.

The user's input says:

"the scientific article passage delimited by backticks. [...] the citation @@CITATION@@ in a scientific article passage delimited by backticks."

So the passage in backticks is:

`"The use of magnetic fields to inhibit scale formation in water systems has been studied for decades. Previous work demonstrated that magnetically treated water reduces scale deposition by 40% under static conditions @@CITATION@@. However, dynamic flow experiments in real pipelines showed no significant effect @@CITATION@@. This discrepancy motivates our investigation into the mechanisms behind these conflicting results."`

Wait, but there are two @@CITATION@@ tags here. Hmm, that's confusing. The user might have intended only one citation, but the example shows two. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake here, but I need to proceed. Let me check the problem again. The user's instruction says "the citation tagged @@CITATION@@ in a scientific article passage delimited by backticks." So perhaps in the given passage, both instances are @@CITATION@@, but the task is to process each citation? Or maybe it's a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the actual citation in question is the second one. Let me read the task again.

The user's task says: "assign a fined-grained rhetorical class of the cited work" for the citation marked @@CITATION@@. Since the passage has two @@CITATION@@, maybe the user intended to have only one, but in the example given, perhaps the second citation is the one to consider. Let me proceed step by step.

First step: Extract the context discussing the citation @@CITATION@@. The entire passage is the context, but need to focus on parts that discuss the citation. The first citation is about static conditions showing a 40% reduction. The second citation is about dynamic flow experiments showing no effect. The key here is that both citations are being compared in the context, leading to a discrepancy. The sentence after says "This discrepancy motivates our investigation..." So the citations are being compared in terms of their results (static vs dynamic conditions, 40% reduction vs no effect). The general intent here is Comparative, specifically comparing the results of the two cited works. 

Looking at the definitions:

CoCoRes is for comparing the results of the cited works with those of the citing paper. Wait, but in the example for CoCoRes, it's comparing the cited work's results with the current paper's. Wait no, the example given for CoCoRes is "the results obtained in the present work differ from the cited experiments." But in the current case, the two citations are being contrasted with each other. Wait the example for CoCoXY is when comparing two cited studies with each other. The CoCoXY example says "conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima @@CITATION@@." which is comparing two cited studies (Wei et al. and Saracco vs the other study). 

Wait, the current context here is that two studies are mentioned: one showed a 40% reduction under static conditions (first citation), the second showed no effect in dynamic flow (second citation). The sentence "This discrepancy motivates..." refers to the conflict between the two cited studies. So the citation (both instances?) are being compared to each other, not to the citing paper's results. Therefore, the rhetorical class would be CoCoXY, which is comparison of explanations or claims between two cited studies. 

Alternatively, if the task is per citation, maybe each citation is part of a comparison. But since the user's example in the problem has two citations, perhaps the citation in question is the second one, and the first is another citation. Wait, but in the user's example, the passage has two @@CITATION@@ tags. But the problem is to classify the citation marked @@CITATION@@, so perhaps each citation is considered individually, but in this case, both are the same @@CITATION@@? That might be a mistake, but assuming that the context is as given, the key is that the two citations are being compared. Since the user's instructions say to consider the citation @@CITATION@@, perhaps each citation is separate. Wait, but the problem says "the citation @@CITATION@@", implying one citation. Maybe the user made an error in the example passage. Alternatively, maybe the two citations are part of the same reference. Hmm, this is a bit confusing, but I'll proceed with the given text.

Assuming the context is the entire passage, and the two citations are both cited, but the task is to classify each citation. However, since the user's instruction is to process the citation @@CITATION@@ in the passage, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that each @@CITATION@@ is a separate citation, and the user is asking for the classification of each. But the output should be one label. Since the user's example might have two citations, but the task is to handle each, perhaps the problem here is that the two citations are being contrasted. Since the general intent here is comparing the results of the two studies, the rhetorical class would be CoCoRes if comparing with the current paper, but since it's comparing the two cited works, then it's CoCoXY. Wait the example for CoCoXY is when two cited works are compared. 

So in the given context, the two citations are presented as conflicting results (static vs dynamic), leading to a discrepancy. The citations are being compared with each other, not with the citing paper's results. Therefore, the rhetorical class for each citation (as part of the comparison between them) would be CoCoXY. 

Alternatively, if the citations are each compared to the current paper's work, but in this case, the current paper is discussing the discrepancy between the two cited works, so the citations are being compared to each other, so CoCoXY is appropriate.

Therefore, the answer should be CoCoXY.
