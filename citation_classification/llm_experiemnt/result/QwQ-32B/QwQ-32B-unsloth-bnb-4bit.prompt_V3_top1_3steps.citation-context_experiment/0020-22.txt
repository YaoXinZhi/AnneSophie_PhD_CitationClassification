Okay, let me tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a scientific article passage with a citation tagged as @@CITATION@@, and I need to classify the rhetorical class of that citation. Let me start by understanding the context given.

The passage says: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." 

First, I need to extract the context discussing the citation. The sentence is straightforward: it mentions that the experimental setup was described before in the cited work. The key here is that the current study is using a method, tool, dataset, or setup from the cited work. 

Next, identifying the general intent. The sentence is stating that the current study's experimental setup was detailed in the cited paper. This sounds like the cited work is being referenced as a source for the method or setup used here. 

Looking at the predefined classes, the 'Usage' category is when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup used in the current study. The example given for Usage is exactly this scenario: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." That's almost the same sentence as in the problem. 

So, the general intent here is 'Technical', which maps to the Usage class. The other options don't fit as well. It's not a comparison (CoCoGM/CoCoRes), motivation, support, or criticism. The citation is purely about using a previously described setup, so the correct label should be Usage.
