Okay, let's tackle this classification problem. The user provided a scientific article passage with a citation tagged as @@CITATION@@, and I need to determine the rhetorical class of that citation. Let me go through the steps carefully.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage given is: 

"In a previous study, @@CITATION@@ demonstrated that the application of magnetic fields can significantly reduce the formation of calcium carbonate scales in industrial water systems. Building on this work, our current research investigates the optimal magnetic field parameters required to achieve maximum scale inhibition under varying water hardness conditions."

Alright, so the context here is about a previous study that showed magnetic fields reduce scale formation. The current research is building on that to find the best parameters. 

Next, I need to identify the general intent. The citation is mentioned as a previous study that demonstrated a certain effect, and the current work is building upon it. That sounds like the cited work is providing the foundational basis for the current research. The current study is expanding or improving upon the cited study's findings. 

Looking at the definitions, the 'Basis' class is when the citation introduces the foundational work that the current research is based on. The example given is similar: replicating previous results. Here, they are building on the cited work, so that's foundational. 

Alternatively, could it be 'Motivation'? The motivation class is when the citation identifies a knowledge gap or need. But here, it's more about using the prior work as a base rather than pointing out a gap. The phrase "Building on this work" suggests that the cited study is the foundation. 

Another possibility is 'Support', but that's when the citation supports the current findings. Here, the cited work isn't supporting the current results yet; it's the basis for the current study's premise. 

So the general intent is Foundational, leading to the 'Basis' class. Let me check the other options again. 'Usage' is about using a method, but here it's the result that's being built upon, not a method. 'CoCoGM' would be if they were comparing methods or goals, but the current study is extending, not comparing. 

Yes, I think 'Basis' is correct here.
