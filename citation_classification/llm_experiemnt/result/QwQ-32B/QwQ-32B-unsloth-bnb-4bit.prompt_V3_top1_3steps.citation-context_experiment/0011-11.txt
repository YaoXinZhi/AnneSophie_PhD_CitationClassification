Okay, let's tackle this classification problem step by step. The user provided a scientific article passage with a citation tagged @@CITATION@@, and I need to determine the rhetorical class of that citation based on the context.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The given passage is: 

"In contrast to previous studies that focused on above-ground symptoms @@CITATION@@, our research highlights the critical role of root health in disease progression."

So the relevant part is "In contrast to previous studies that focused on above-ground symptoms @@CITATION@@, our research highlights the critical role of root health in disease progression."

Step 1: The context here is comparing the current study's focus on root health with previous studies that looked at above-ground symptoms. The citation is mentioned in a contrasting statement, indicating a comparison between the cited work and the current paper.

Step 2: The general intent seems to be comparative because the authors are contrasting their approach (root health) with the cited studies (above-ground symptoms). Now, looking at the subcategories for comparative: CoCoGM (goals/methods), CoCoRes (results), or CoCoXY (comparing explanations or claims between cited works). 

In this case, the comparison is about where the previous studies focused (above-ground symptoms) versus the current study's focus (root health). This is a difference in the research goals or methods since they're looking at different aspects of the disease. The citation is pointing out that prior work had a different focus, so the current work is contrasting their methodology or objectives. 

So, CoCoGM (Comparison of Goals or Methods) seems appropriate here. The key is that they're contrasting what the previous studies studied (above-ground) versus what the current study is doing (root health), which relates to their research goals or methods rather than their results or explanations. 

I don't think it's CoCoRes because it's not comparing results but rather the focus of the studies. Also, not CoCoXY since it's comparing with the current paper's approach. 

Therefore, the specific rhetorical class should be CoCoGM.
