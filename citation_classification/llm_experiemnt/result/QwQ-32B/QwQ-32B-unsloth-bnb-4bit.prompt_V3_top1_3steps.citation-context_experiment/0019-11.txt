Okay, let me tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage according to the predefined rhetorical classes. The passage provided is:

"The application of magnetic fields in water treatment has been studied for decades, with some reports showing scale prevention @@CITATION@@ and others indicating no significant effect @@CITATION@@. Our study builds on these conflicting findings to explore the underlying mechanisms."

First, I need to follow the three steps outlined. 

Step 1: Extract the context discussing the citation. The relevant part here is "some reports showing scale prevention @@CITATION@@ and others indicating no significant effect @@CITATION@@." The citation is part of a discussion comparing different results where some studies show prevention and others don't.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation is part of a comparison between different studies' results. The passage mentions "conflicting findings," which points to a comparative intent. The specific comparison here is between the results of the cited works, so it's about comparing results.

Step 3: Choose the specific rhetorical class. Looking at the definitions, CoCoRes is for comparing results. The example given for CoCoRes is when results differ between studies. Since the passage is pointing out that some studies show prevention and others don't, this is a direct comparison of results between the cited works. 

Wait, but the example for CoCoXY is when two cited studies are compared with each other, not with the citing paper. The example given there is conflicting results between two studies. In the user's example for CoCoXY, they mention two studies (Wei et al. and Saracco) versus another study. Here, the current passage is comparing two sets of results from different citations, so the citation here is part of a comparison between the cited studies themselves. The citing paper is building on these conflicting findings. 

So the citation here is used to highlight the conflicting results between the cited works, not between the cited and the current paper. Therefore, the general intent is comparative, and the specific class would be CoCoRes if it's comparing with the current paper, but since it's comparing the cited studies, it's CoCoXY. Wait, let me check the definitions again. 

CoCoRes is when comparing the cited work's results with the citing paper's. CoCoXY is when comparing two cited studies with each other. The example given for CoCoXY is when two studies are mentioned and conflicting results are noted between them. In the user's example, the citation is part of a statement that says "some reports show X, others Y", which is comparing the cited studies. Therefore, the correct class would be CoCoXY. 

But the passage here says "our study builds on these conflicting findings". The citation is part of the context that there are conflicting results from previous studies. The rhetorical class here is pointing out that the cited works have conflicting results, so it's a comparison between the cited works, not between the current work and the cited ones. So the correct label is CoCoXY.
