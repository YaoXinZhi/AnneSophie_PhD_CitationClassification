Okay, let me tackle this classification step by step. The user provided a scientific article passage with a citation tagged @@CITATION@@, and I need to determine the rhetorical class of that citation. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage says: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." 

Step 1: Extracting the context. The relevant part here is "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." So the key point is that the current study is referring to a prior description of their experimental setup.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The sentence is stating that the method or setup they used was detailed in the cited work. This sounds like they are referencing a method or procedure from the cited paper. 

Looking at the general intent categories, "Technical â†’ Usage" seems relevant because Usage is when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup used in the current study. The example given for Usage is exactly this scenario: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." 

So the specific rhetorical class here should be Usage. Let me check the other options to be sure. 

Is it Support? No, because they're not supporting a result, just referencing the setup. Similar? Not really, since it's not pointing out a similarity. Basis? It's not the foundational theory but the experimental setup. So yes, Usage is correct.
