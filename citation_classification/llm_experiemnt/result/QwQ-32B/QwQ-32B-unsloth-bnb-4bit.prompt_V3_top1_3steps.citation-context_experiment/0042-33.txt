Okay, let me tackle this classification problem step by step. The user provided a passage where they mention a citation tagged as @@CITATION@@, and I need to determine the rhetorical class of that citation based on the given definitions. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The example given in the problem is the passage: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." 

Step 1: Extract the context. The relevant part here is "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." The key part is that the experimental setup was described before, so the citation is pointing to a prior work that detailed the method or setup used here.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The sentence is stating that the current study's setup was described in detail in the cited work. This sounds like the cited work provided a method or experimental setup that the current paper is using. Looking at the general intent categories, "Technical â†’ Usage" because they are referring to using a method, tool, dataset, or setup from the cited work.

Step 3: Now, check the specific classes. The Usage class is defined as when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup from the cited work that is directly used in the current study. The example given for Usage is exactly similar: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." 

Comparing with other options: Support would be if they used the citation to back up their results, but here it's about the setup. Basis is about foundational work, but here it's a specific method. So the correct label should be Usage.
