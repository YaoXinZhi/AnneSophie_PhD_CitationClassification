Okay, let me tackle this classification problem step by step. The user provided a scientific article passage with a citation tagged as @@CITATION@@, and I need to determine the rhetorical class of that citation. The predefined classes are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Motivation, Future, Support, Similar, Usage, Weakness, and Neutral.

First, I need to follow the steps outlined. 

Step 1: Extract the context discussing the citation. The passage given is:

"In a recent study, it was found that the application of magnetic fields could significantly reduce the occurrence of fungal infections in tomato plants @@CITATION@@. This finding has important implications for sustainable agriculture, as it offers a non-chemical method to combat plant diseases. However, the mechanism behind this effect remains unclear, prompting further investigation into how magnetic fields interact with fungal spores."

The citation here is in the first sentence. The context around it mentions that the study found a significant reduction in fungal infections using magnetic fields. The following sentences talk about the implications and the need for more research on the mechanism.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation is introducing a finding that the current study builds upon. The next sentence mentions the implication and then a knowledge gap ("mechanism remains unclear"), which leads to their current investigation. This seems like the cited work provided foundational results that the current study is expanding upon. The citation is pointing out a previous result that motivates the current research because there's a gap in understanding the mechanism. 

Alternatively, could it be Motivation? The example for Motivation is when the citation identifies a knowledge gap or need. Here, the cited study's result leads to the current study's motivation because the mechanism isn't clear. The sentence after the citation says "However, the mechanism... prompting further investigation..." which is exactly the scenario for Motivation. 

Wait, the Motivation class example was: "The explanation of the phenomena is not yet offered and the purpose of this work is to try to understand the mechanism..." which aligns with this. The cited work shows a result, and the current paper is motivated by the need to explain it. 

Alternatively, could it be Basis? The Basis class is when the citation is the foundation of the current research. The example given for Basis is replicating previous results. Here, the current study isn't replicating but is investigating the mechanism behind the cited result. So maybe not Basis. 

Alternatively, maybe the citation is used to set up the context, and the motivation is derived from the cited work's findings. So the general intent here is Motivational, leading to the specific class Motivation.

Wait the Motivation class is for when the citation justifies why the current research is conducted, like identifying a knowledge gap. The cited study shows that magnetic fields reduce infections, but the mechanism isn't known, so the current work is motivated to investigate that. So the citation is used to state a prior result which highlights the gap. That fits Motivation.

Alternatively, the first sentence presents the cited study's finding, and the next sentences explain the implication and the need for more research. The citation is the basis for the current study's motivation. 

Therefore, the general intent is Motivational, and the specific class would be Motivation.
