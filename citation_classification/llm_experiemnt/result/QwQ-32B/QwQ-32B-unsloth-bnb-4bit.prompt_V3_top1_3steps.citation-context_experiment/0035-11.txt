Okay, let's tackle this classification problem. The user provided a scientific article passage with a citation tagged as @@CITATION@@, and I need to determine the rhetorical class of that citation. Let me go through the steps outlined.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage given is: 

"The role of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in enhancing plant drought tolerance has been widely studied @@CITATION@@. Recent studies, however, have shown that the effectiveness of AMF varies significantly depending on the plant species and environmental conditions. Our research builds on this foundation to explore how AMF interactions with different host plants can be optimized under drought conditions."

So the part with the citation is "The role of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in enhancing plant drought tolerance has been widely studied @@CITATION@@." The rest of the passage talks about recent studies showing variability and the current research building on this foundation.

Step 1: Extract the context discussing the citation. The relevant part here is that the citation is mentioned in the context of the role of AMF in plant drought tolerance being "widely studied." The following sentences mention that recent studies show variation, and the current research builds on this foundation.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation here is referring to prior foundational work that the current research is building upon. The phrase "builds on this foundation" suggests that the cited work is a basis for the current study. 

Looking at the definitions:

- **Basis**: The citation references the intellectual foundation of the current research. The example given is about replicating previous work, which is similar here since the current research is building on the cited studies.

Other possibilities: Could it be Support? The citation is mentioned as something that's been widely studied, so maybe supporting the importance of the topic. But the key part is "builds on this foundation," which points more towards Basis. Support would be if they're confirming their own results with the citation. Here, it's more about the cited work being the foundation that the current work is extending.

Motivation? The citation here isn't pointing out a gap but rather establishing existing knowledge that the current work is building on, so Basis is better.

Therefore, the specific rhetorical class should be **Basis**.
