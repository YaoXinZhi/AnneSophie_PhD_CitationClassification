Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. The user provided a scientific article passage with a citation tagged @@CITATION@@, and I need to determine the rhetorical class of that citation.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@."

Looking at Step 1, the context here is comparing the current study's results with those from the cited work. The key phrase is "substantially differ from the results," which indicates a direct comparison of findings.

Step 2 is identifying the general intent. Since they're comparing results, the general intent is Comparative. Now, looking at the specific subclasses under Comparative: CoCoGM (goals/methods), CoCoRes (results), or CoCoXY (explanations/claims). The example given for CoCoRes matches exactly here because it's about comparing results directly. The current work's results are contrasted with the cited study's results, so CoCoRes is the right category.

Step 3 confirms that CoCoRes is the most appropriate label here. The other options like Support or Weakness don't fit because it's not about supporting or criticizing, just a direct result comparison. So the answer should be CoCoRes.
