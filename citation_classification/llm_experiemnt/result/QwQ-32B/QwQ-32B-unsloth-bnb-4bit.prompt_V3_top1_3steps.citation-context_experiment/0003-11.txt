Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user provided a scientific article citation passage and wants me to classify the rhetorical class of the citation marked @@CITATION@@. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The given passage is:

"Phytoplasma infection causes a variety of symptoms in plants, including witches' broom and phloem necrosis. The molecular mechanisms underlying these symptoms remain unclear @@CITATION@@. Recent studies have focused on identifying host genes involved in the interaction with phytoplasma, but a comprehensive understanding is still lacking."

So the context around @@CITATION@@ is "The molecular mechanisms underlying these symptoms remain unclear @@CITATION@@." 

Next, I need to identify the general intent. The sentence states that the mechanisms are "unclear," and the citation is pointing out that there's a lack of understanding. That seems like it's highlighting a knowledge gap, which would fall under Motivational intent, specifically Motivation because it's justifying why the current research is needed.

Now, looking at the specific classes under Motivational: Motivation and Future. The example for Motivation is about identifying a knowledge gap or need, which matches here. The citation here is pointing out that the mechanisms are unclear, motivating the current study to address that gap. Future is more about suggesting directions for future research, which isn't exactly what's happening here. The sentence isn't suggesting future work but explaining the current lack of knowledge, so Motivation is the right choice.

So the final label should be Motivation.

Motivation
