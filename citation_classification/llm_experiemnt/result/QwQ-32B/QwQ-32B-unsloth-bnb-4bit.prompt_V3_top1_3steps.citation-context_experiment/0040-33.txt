Okay, let's tackle this classification problem. The user provided a scientific article passage with a citation tagged @@CITATION@@, and I need to determine the rhetorical class of that citation. Let me go through the steps carefully.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage given is:

"However, the role of plant root exudates in attracting beneficial microbes remains understudied compared to their role in deterring pathogens @@CITATION@@. Our study addresses this gap by investigating the chemical components of root exudates from maize plants and their interaction with Pseudomonas fluorescens."

So the part around the citation is: "However, the role of plant root exudates in attracting beneficial microbes remains understudied compared to their role in deterring pathogens @@CITATION@@."

Step 1: Extract the context. The relevant sentence here is pointing out that the role of root exudates in attracting beneficial microbes is less studied than their role in deterring pathogens. The citation is attached to this statement.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The sentence is highlighting a knowledge gapâ€”the understudied area of root exudates attracting beneficial microbes versus their better-studied role against pathogens. The citation here is likely pointing out that prior studies have focused more on the pathogen deterrence aspect, which creates a motivation for the current study to address the gap. 

Looking at the general intent categories: Motivational. Since the citation is used to justify why the current research is being done (because the area is understudied), that would fall under Motivational.

Now, checking the specific rhetorical classes under Motivational: Motivation or Future. The example for Motivation is about identifying a knowledge gap or need, which fits here. The example given for Motivation is a previous study showing a phenomenon but not explaining the mechanism, leading to the current study's purpose. Similarly, here the citation is pointing out that the role in attracting beneficial microbes is understudied, motivating the current study to address that gap. So Motivation is the right choice.

I should make sure it's not Basis, because Basis is about foundational work. Here, the citation isn't the foundation but pointing out a gap. It's not Comparative (CoCo categories), Supportive, or Technical. So the answer should be Motivation.
