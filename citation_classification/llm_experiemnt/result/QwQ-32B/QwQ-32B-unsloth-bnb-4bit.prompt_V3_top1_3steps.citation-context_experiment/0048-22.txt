Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. The user provided a passage and wants me to determine the rhetorical class of the citation marked as @@CITATION@@. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The given passage is:

"The role of mycorrhizal fungi in enhancing plant resistance to pathogens has been well-documented @@CITATION@@. Recent studies, however, have highlighted variations in efficacy depending on soil type @@CITATION@@. Our research builds on this by examining ..."

So the part with @@CITATION@@ is in the first sentence: "The role of mycorrhizal fungi in enhancing plant resistance to pathogens has been well-documented @@CITATION@@."

Step 1: Extract the context. The sentence states that the cited work has well-documented the role of mycorrhizal fungi in plant resistance. The key phrase here is "well-documented," which suggests that the cited work supports the current authors' statement.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. Since the citation is used to back up the assertion about the role of mycorrhizal fungi, this seems supportive. The general intent would be "Supportive," leading to either Support or Similar.

Step 3: Choose the specific class. The example for "Support" is when the citation supports the citing authors' work. Here, the first citation is used to confirm that the role is well-documented, so it's supporting the authors' premise. The second citation (not marked here) is about variations, but the first is straightforward support. 

Looking at the definitions, "Support" is when the citation supports the citing authors' work. The sentence structure here is using the citation to back up their statement, so "Support" is the right choice. "Similar" would be if they were pointing out a similarity between their work and the cited, but here it's more about backing a claim. 

Therefore, the label should be Support.
