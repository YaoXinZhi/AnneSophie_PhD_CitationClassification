Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user provided a scientific passage with a citation marked as @@CITATION@@ and wants me to classify the rhetorical class of that citation. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The given passage is: 

"Recent studies have highlighted the role of microbial communities in plant health, particularly in enhancing nutrient uptake @@CITATION@@. However, the specific mechanisms through which these interactions occur remain poorly understood, necessitating further investigation."

So the part around the citation is "Recent studies have highlighted the role of microbial communities in plant health, particularly in enhancing nutrient uptake @@CITATION@@." 

Now, step two is identifying the general intent. The citation here is mentioned in the context of "recent studies" that have highlighted a role. The next sentence says the mechanisms are not well understood, which points to a need for more research. 

Looking at the options for general intent: the citation is pointing out prior work that has shown something, but the current paper is pointing out that despite this, there's a gap. That sounds like the citation is used to set up a motivation for the current study. The "necessitating further investigation" part suggests that the cited work identified a knowledge gap or a need, which would fall under Motivational. 

Now, looking at the specific classes under Motivational: Motivation or Future. The example for Motivation is when the citation justifies the current research by pointing out a gap, which seems to fit here. The citation here is supporting why the current research is needed. Future is more about suggesting directions, but the citation here is about the existing work leading to the need for the current study. So the specific class should be Motivation.
