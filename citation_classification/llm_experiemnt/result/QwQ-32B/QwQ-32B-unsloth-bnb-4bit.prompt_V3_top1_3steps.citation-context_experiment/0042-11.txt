Okay, let me tackle this step by step. The user provided a scientific article passage with a citation marked as @@CITATION@@, and I need to classify the rhetorical class of that citation.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage says: "However, the role of fungal endophytes in plant defense against herbivores is still poorly understood, despite their widespread presence in plant tissues @@CITATION@@." 

So the key part here is that the citation is following a statement about the role of fungal endophytes in plant defense being poorly understood, even though they are widespread. The author is pointing out a gap in current knowledge. 

Next, I need to identify the general intent. The sentence mentions that despite their presence, the role isn't well understood. This seems like the author is justifying why their current research is necessaryâ€”they're highlighting a knowledge gap. That would fall under the Motivational category. 

Now, looking at the specific classes under Motivational: Motivation or Future. The example for Motivation is about justifying the research because of a need or knowledge gap, which matches here. The citation here is pointing out that there's a lack of understanding, which motivates the current study. Future is more about suggesting directions for future research, but this is more about why the current work is needed. 

So the specific class should be Motivation. Let me double-check the definitions. Motivation is for justifying the research by identifying a gap or need. Yes, that's exactly what this is. The citation supports the idea that there's a gap, motivating the current study.
