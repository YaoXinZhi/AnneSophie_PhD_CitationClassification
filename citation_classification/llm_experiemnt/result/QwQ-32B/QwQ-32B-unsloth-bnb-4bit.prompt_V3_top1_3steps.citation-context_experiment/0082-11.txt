Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user provided a scientific article passage with a citation tagged as @@CITATION@@, and I need to classify its rhetorical class. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage given is: 

"The role of phytoplasmas in plant health has been extensively studied, with previous work highlighting their impact on host plant metabolism @@CITATION@@. However, the specific mechanisms by which these pathogens manipulate carbohydrate transport remain unclear."

Step 1: Extract the context discussing the citation. The relevant part here is "previous work highlighting their impact on host plant metabolism @@CITATION@@", and the following sentence mentions that specific mechanisms are still unclear. 

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation is mentioned in the context of prior research that has studied the impact of phytoplasmas on host plant metabolism. The next sentence points out a gap in understanding the specific mechanisms. This seems to be pointing out a knowledge gap, which would fall under Motivational intent, specifically Motivation, because it's justifying why the current research is being done. The citation is used to show that prior work exists, but there's still a need for more research on mechanisms. 

Step 3: Select the specific rhetorical class. The options under Motivational are Motivation and Future. Since the citation is used to highlight a knowledge gap (the mechanisms are unclear), this is about motivating the current study's purpose. The example given for Motivation mentions identifying a knowledge gap, which matches here. The Future class is for suggesting future directions, but here the citation is used to explain the motivation for the current study, not suggesting what should be done next. 

So the most appropriate label would be Motivation.

Motivation
