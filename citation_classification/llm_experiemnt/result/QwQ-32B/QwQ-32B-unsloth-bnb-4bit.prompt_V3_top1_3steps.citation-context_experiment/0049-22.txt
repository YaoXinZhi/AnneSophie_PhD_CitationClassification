Okay, let me try to work through this step by step. The user provided a task where I need to classify a citation in a scientific article passage. The citation is tagged as @@CITATION@@, and I have to determine its rhetorical class based on the context given.

First, I need to follow the steps outlined. Let me start by looking at the example given. The user's example passage is:

"The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@."

The task is to classify the citation here. Let's go through each step.

Step 1: Extract the context discussing the citation. The relevant part here is "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." So the context is about the experimental setup being described in a previous work.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The sentence says that the experimental setup was described in detail in the cited work. That sounds like the current study is using the setup from the cited work. So the general intent might be "Technical" since it's referring to the usage of a method or setup.

Looking at the predefined classes, the "Usage" class is for when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup used in the current study. The example given for Usage is exactly this scenario: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." So that's a direct match.

Step 3: The specific rhetorical class here would be "Usage" because the citation is pointing out that the current study's experimental setup was described in the cited work, indicating that they're using that setup.

Wait, but let me double-check the other options to be sure. Could it be "Basis"? Basis is for foundational work. But here it's more about the method being used, not the intellectual foundation. "Support" is for supporting the current work's findings, but here it's about the setup. "Similar" would be if they're saying their results are similar, but it's about the setup being the same. So yes, "Usage" fits best.
