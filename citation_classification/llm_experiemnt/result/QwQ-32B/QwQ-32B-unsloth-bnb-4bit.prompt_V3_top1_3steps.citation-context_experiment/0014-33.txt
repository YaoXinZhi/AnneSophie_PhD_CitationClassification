Okay, let's tackle this classification. The user provided a passage and wants me to determine the rhetorical class of the citation @@CITATION@@. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage says: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." 

Step 1 is to extract the relevant context. Here, the key part is "experimental set-up was described in detail previously." That's the main point here.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The sentence is stating that the setup they used was already detailed in a previous work. That sounds like they're referencing a method or tool used in their current study. Looking at the general intents, "Technical" would fall under Usage, since it's about using a method or setup from the cited work.

Step 3: Check the specific classes. The example for Usage is exactly about mentioning a method or setup from a previous paper. The sentence structure here matches the example given for Usage: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." So the citation is pointing out that they used a previously described setup, which fits the Usage category. 

No other categories seem to fit here. It's not a comparison (CoCo*), not supporting a result (Support), nor is it foundational (Basis). The key here is that they are using the cited work's experimental setup. So the answer should be Usage.
