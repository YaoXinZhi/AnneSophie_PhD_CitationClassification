Okay, let's tackle this classification problem step by step. The user provided a scientific article passage with a citation tagged as @@CITATION@@, and I need to determine the rhetorical class of that citation based on the context. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage given is:

"Investigations into the role of phytoplasma titer in host plant symptom expression have been limited to a few studies @@CITATION@@. Our study expands this research by examining a broader range of plant species and infection levels."

Alright, so the citation is mentioned in the first sentence. The context here is talking about how previous studies (the cited work) have only looked into the role of phytoplasma titer in host plant symptoms in a limited way. The current study then says they're expanding on that by looking at more species and infection levels.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation here is pointing out that prior research has been limited. The current work is building upon that by doing more extensive research. That sounds like the cited work is highlighting a knowledge gap or a need for further research, which would fall under Motivational. But let me check the definitions again.

Looking at the Motivation class: it's used to justify the current research by identifying a knowledge gap, need, etc. The example given is similar: previous research showed something but didn't explain the mechanism, so the current work is to understand it. In this case, the cited studies are mentioned as being limited, so the current study is motivated by that gap. So that's Motivation.

Alternatively, could it be Basis? Basis is when the citation is the foundation. Here, it's more about pointing out the limitation of prior work to motivate their own study. So Motivation fits better. 

Wait, the other possibility is CoCoGM if they're comparing methods or goals. But the sentence doesn't compare methods; it just says previous studies were limited. The current study is expanding, which is more about filling a gap. So yes, Motivation is the right general intent.

Step 3: Select the specific class. The options under Motivational are Motivation and Future. Motivation is for justifying the current research, which this is. Future is for suggesting future directions. Since the current study is addressing the gap, it's Motivation. 

So the answer should be Motivation.
