Okay, let's tackle this classification task step by step. The user provided a passage with a citation marked as @@CITATION@@, and I need to determine the rhetorical class of that citation. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@."

Step 1 is to extract the relevant context. The key part here is "the results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments..." So the citation is being compared in terms of their results.

Moving to Step 2, identifying the general intent. The comparison here is directly about the results differing. That points towards a comparative intent. Now looking at the specific classes under comparative: CoCoGM (goals/methods), CoCoRes (results), CoCoXY (explanations or claims). Since the context is about differing results, CoCoRes is the likely candidate here. 

Step 3: Confirming the specific class. The example given for CoCoRes is almost identical to the user's passage: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results... @@CITATION@@." So this matches exactly. Therefore, the correct label should be CoCoRes.
