Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user provided a scientific article passage with a citation tagged as @@CITATION@@, and I need to classify the rhetorical class of that citation. The example given is about plant health, so I should keep that in mind.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage says: "Previous studies have shown that magnetic treatment can reduce scale formation in hard water systems @@CITATION@@. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear, prompting our investigation into the physicochemical changes induced by the magnetic field." 

Step 1 is to extract the relevant context. The sentence before the citation mentions previous studies showing magnetic treatment's effect, and the citation is tagged there. The following sentence says the mechanism is unclear, which is why their study was done. 

Step 2: Determine the general intent. The citation here is referring to prior work that demonstrated an effect, but the current study is motivated by the need to understand the mechanism. The citation is pointing out a knowledge gap, which would fall under Motivational. 

Looking at the specific classes, the Motivation class is for justifying the current research by identifying a gap or need. The example given for Motivation mentions a previous study that showed a result but didn't explain the mechanism, similar to this case. The citation here is used to state that prior work showed something, but since the mechanism isn't clear, the current study is motivated to explore that. 

Alternatively, could it be Basis? The Basis class is when the cited work is the foundation. But here, the current study isn't building on their method or theory directly; it's more about addressing a gap they identified. So Motivation seems right. 

Future class is about suggesting future directions, but here it's the motivation for the current study, not suggesting what should be done next. Support? No, because it's not supporting the current results but explaining why the study was done. 

So the answer should be Motivation.
