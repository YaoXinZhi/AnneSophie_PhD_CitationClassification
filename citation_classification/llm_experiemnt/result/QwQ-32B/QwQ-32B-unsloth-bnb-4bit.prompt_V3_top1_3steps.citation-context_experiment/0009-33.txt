Okay, let me tackle this step by step. The user wants me to classify the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage is about plant health, so I should focus on that.

Looking at the example provided by the user, the citation is part of a sentence discussing phytoplasma strains in different plant hosts. The key part here is "although conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima @@CITATION@@." 

So, the context mentions that while some studies (Wei et al. and Saracco et al.) reported certain findings, there are conflicting results from another study cited here. The comparison is between the cited works themselves, not with the current paper's work. 

The general intent here is Comparative, and under the specific classes, CoCoXY is for comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies. The example given for CoCoXY is almost identical to this scenario. The citation is pointing out a conflict between studies, so that's a comparison of their results or explanations. 

I need to make sure it's not CoCoRes, which is comparing results with the citing paper's results. But here, it's contrasting two other studies, so CoCoXY is the right choice. The label should be CoCoXY.
