Okay, let's tackle this classification problem. The user provided a scientific article passage with a citation tagged as @@CITATION@@, and I need to determine the rhetorical class of that citation. Let me go through the steps as outlined.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage given is:

"In a recent study, it was shown that the application of magnetic fields can significantly reduce scale formation in industrial water systems @@CITATION@@. However, the underlying mechanism remained unclear, prompting further investigation into the interaction between magnetic fields and calcium carbonate crystallization."

Hmm, so the citation is referring to a previous study that demonstrated the effect of magnetic fields on scale reduction. The current study is looking into the mechanism, which the cited study didn't explain. 

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The current paper is building upon the cited work by addressing a gapâ€”explaining the mechanism. The cited study provided foundational results that the current work is expanding on. That sounds like the cited work is the basis for the current research. 

Looking at the definitions, "Basis" is when the citation introduces the foundation. The example given for Basis mentions replicating previous results, which is similar here because the cited work's findings are the starting point. The current study's motivation is to understand the mechanism that the cited study didn't, so it's foundational. 

Comparing to other options: "Motivation" is about justifying the current research, but here the cited work's result is the basis, not just the motivation. "Support" would be if they agree with the cited work's findings, but here it's more about building on it. "Future" is suggesting future directions, but the cited work's gap is being addressed now. 

So the most appropriate label here should be "Basis".
