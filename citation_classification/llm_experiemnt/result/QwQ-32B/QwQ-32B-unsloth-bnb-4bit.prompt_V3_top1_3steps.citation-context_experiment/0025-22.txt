Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. First, I need to look at the provided passage and the citation marked with @@CITATION@@. The user wants me to figure out the rhetorical class of that citation based on the context.

Starting with Step 1: Extract the context discussing the citation. The passage given is:

"In recent studies, the role of phytoplasma in plant health has been explored extensively. However, the impact of environmental factors on phytoplasma multiplication remains understudied. A previous study by @@CITATION@@ reported inconsistent results regarding the effect of temperature on 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains in daisy plants. This discrepancy motivates our current investigation into how varying temperature conditions influence phytoplasma proliferation across different host plants."

So the relevant part here is the sentence mentioning the citation: "A previous study by @@CITATION@@ reported inconsistent results regarding the effect of temperature on 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains in daisy plants." The next sentence says this discrepancy motivates their current work.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation here is pointing out that prior work had inconsistent or conflicting results. The current study is motivated by that discrepancy. The general intent seems to be Motivational because it's explaining why the current research is being doneâ€”because there's a knowledge gap or conflicting findings that need to be addressed.

Looking at the specific classes under Motivational: the options are Motivation or Future. Since the citation is used to justify the current research (because of the inconsistency), it's Motivation. Future would be if it's suggesting what should be done next, but here it's about why this study is being conducted now.

Step 3: Choose the specific label. The example for Motivation is when a previous study shows something and the current work's purpose is to address an unexplained mechanism. Here, the cited work's inconsistent results are motivating the current study. So "Motivation" is the right class. The other options don't fit: it's not a comparison (CoCo...), support, or usage. It's definitely about motivating the current research based on prior findings.
