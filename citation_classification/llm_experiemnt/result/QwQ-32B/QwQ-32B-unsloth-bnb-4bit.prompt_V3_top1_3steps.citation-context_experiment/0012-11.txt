Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the citation @@CITATION@@ from the provided passage. The user hasn't given the actual passage here, so I must assume that the example given in the problem is the context. Wait, looking back, the example provided under "CoCoXY" is: "Fast multiplication rates... although conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima @@CITATION@@." 

So the context here is discussing conflicting results between two studies. The first part mentions that some studies reported certain findings in young leaves and roots, but then contrasts that with another study (the citation) that describes conflicting results. 

Step 1: The context is about comparing two studies' results, pointing out that there's a conflict between them. The citation is part of this comparison between the two studies. 

Step 2: The general intent here is comparative because it's contrasting results from different studies. Now, looking at the subcategories for comparative: CoCoGM (goals/methods), CoCoRes (results), CoCoXY (comparing explanations or claims between cited studies). 

In the example, the key phrase is "although conflicting results were described...", which directly compares the cited work with another study mentioned (Wei et al. and Saracco vs. the cited one). The comparison isn't between the citing paper and the cited one, but between two cited studies. That fits CoCoXY, which is for when the citation compares two cited works with each other. 

So the specific rhetorical class here should be CoCoXY. Let me confirm definitions again: CoCoXY is when the citation is used to compare or contrast two cited studies with each other, not with the citing paper. The example given under CoCoXY matches exactly this scenario. 

Therefore, the correct label is CoCoXY.
