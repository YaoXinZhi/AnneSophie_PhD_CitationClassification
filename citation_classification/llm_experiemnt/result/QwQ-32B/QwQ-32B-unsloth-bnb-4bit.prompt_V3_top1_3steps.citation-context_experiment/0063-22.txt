Okay, let me try to work through this step by step. The user provided a scientific article passage with a citation tagged @@CITATION@@, and I need to classify the rhetorical class of that citation. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage given is:

"The role of phytoplasmas in plant health has been extensively studied, with previous research highlighting their impact on host plant metabolism @@CITATION@@. However, the specific mechanisms by which these pathogens manipulate carbohydrate allocation remain unclear, prompting further investigation."

So the relevant part here is: "previous research highlighting their impact on host plant metabolism @@CITATION@@", and the next sentence says that the mechanisms are still unclear, which prompts more investigation.

Step 1 is to extract the context discussing the citation. The key parts are "previous research highlighting their impact on host plant metabolism" and the following sentence about unclear mechanisms. The citation here is supporting the statement that prior work has looked at the impact on metabolism but there's a gap in understanding the mechanisms.

Moving to Step 2, identifying the general intent. The citation is mentioned in the context of prior research that has highlighted certain impacts, but the current study is addressing a gap. The first part seems to acknowledge existing work (maybe support or basis?), but the "however" introduces a knowledge gap, which is a motivation for the current study. 

Looking at the definitions:

- Motivation: Justifying the current research by pointing out a knowledge gap or need. The example given is about a previous study showing something, but the explanation isn't offered, so the purpose is to understand. Here, the citation mentions previous research on impact, but the mechanisms are unclear, prompting further investigation. That seems like Motivation.

Alternatively, could it be Basis? Basis is when the citation is the foundation. But here, the current study is building on previous work but pointing out a gap, which is more about motivation.

Step 3: The specific class. The options under Motivational are Motivation and Future. Since the citation here is pointing out a gap that the current work is addressing, that's Motivation. Future would be suggesting directions for future research, but here the current study is the one being motivated by that gap. 

So the answer should be Motivation.

Motivation
