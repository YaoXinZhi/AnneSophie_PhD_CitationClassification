Okay, let's tackle this classification problem. The user provided a passage where a citation is tagged as @@CITATION@@, and I need to determine its rhetorical class based on the context. Let me go through the steps carefully.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage given is: 

"Previous studies have shown that certain plant pathogens can be controlled using biological agents. For example, the application of Trichoderma spp. has been effective in suppressing Fusarium wilt in tomatoes @@CITATION@@. However, the long-term sustainability of such biocontrol methods remains uncertain due to varying environmental conditions."

Hmm, so the citation is referring to the effectiveness of Trichoderma spp. in controlling Fusarium wilt. The sentence structure here is presenting an example where the cited work supports the current paper's statement. The phrase "For example" indicates that the citation is providing an instance that supports the broader claim about biological agents being effective. 

Moving to Step 2, identifying the general intent. The citation here is used to back up the assertion that biological agents are effective. The example given (Trichoderma spp.) supports the cited study's findings, so the intent seems supportive. 

Now, looking at the specific classes. The options under Supportive are Support and Similar. The Support class is when the citation supports the citing authors' work. The example given for Support is when previous research is consistent with the current findings. Here, the citation is used to support the general statement made in the current paper, so Support seems appropriate. 

Wait, but let me check if it's Similar. The Similar class is when pointing out a similarity between the cited and citing work. However, in this case, the current paper is not necessarily saying their results are similar to the cited work; they're using the cited work as evidence for a broader point. So Support is better. 

Alternatively, could it be Usage? No, because Usage refers to using a method or tool from the cited work. Here, they're citing the result, not the method. 

Basis? Basis is about foundational work. The citation here is an example supporting a statement, not the foundation of the current research. 

So the answer should be Support. Let me confirm again. The sentence structure is "For example... @@CITATION@@", which is providing evidence for the effectiveness, thus supporting the current paper's claim. Therefore, the rhetorical class is Support.
