Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user provided a citation passage and wants me to classify the citation's rhetorical class. The passage given is:

"Investigations into the impact of soil pH on plant pathogen prevalence have shown mixed results, with some studies indicating increased fungal growth at lower pH levels @@CITATION@@, while others report higher infection rates under neutral conditions @@CITATION@@."

First, I need to extract the context discussing the citation. The relevant part here is "some studies indicating increased fungal growth at lower pH levels @@CITATION@@, while others report higher infection rates under neutral conditions @@CITATION@@." The citation here is part of a comparison between different studies' results.

Next, identifying the general intent. The sentence is comparing two different findings from studies: one showing increased fungal growth at lower pH, another at neutral conditions. This seems like a comparative intent. Looking at the comparative subclasses: CoCoRes is for comparing results, CoCoGM for goals/methods, CoCoXY for explanations or claims. Since they're directly comparing the results (higher infection rates in different pH levels), CoCoRes is likely.

But wait, the citation here is comparing two cited studies with each other, not the citing paper. Wait, the example for CoCoXY is when comparing two cited studies. Let me check the definitions again. 

CoCoRes is when comparing the cited work's results with the citing paper's. CoCoXY is when comparing two cited studies. The sentence here says "some studies... @@CITATION@@, while others @@CITATION@@", so the citation is part of contrasting two different cited studies. That would fall under CoCoXY, which is for comparing two cited works. The example given for CoCoXY is conflicting results between two studies, similar to this case. 

So the general intent is Comparative, and the specific class is CoCoXY.
