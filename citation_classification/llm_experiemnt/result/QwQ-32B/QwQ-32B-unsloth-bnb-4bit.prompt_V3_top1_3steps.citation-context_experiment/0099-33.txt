Okay, let's tackle this classification problem. The user provided a citation passage and wants me to determine the rhetorical class of the citation @@CITATION@@. 

First, I need to follow the steps outlined. The first step is to extract the context discussing the citation. The given passage is:

"In a recent study, researchers found that magnetic treatment of irrigation water could reduce calcium carbonate scaling in pipes by 40% @@CITATION@@. However, the mechanism behind this effect remains unclear, prompting our investigation into the role of ion interaction dynamics."

So the context around the citation is "In a recent study, researchers found that magnetic treatment of irrigation water could reduce calcium carbonate scaling in pipes by 40%. However, the mechanism behind this effect remains unclear, prompting our investigation into the role of ion interaction dynamics."

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation is mentioned because the current study is prompted by the need to understand the mechanism. The key phrase here is "However, the mechanism... remains unclear, prompting our investigation." This sounds like the cited work identified a result (the 40% reduction) but didn't explain why it happened. The current paper is addressing that gap. 

Looking at the general intent categories, this seems like "Motivational" because the cited work's findings (the result without explanation) motivate the current research. The motivation is to fill a knowledge gap pointed out by the cited study.

Now, for Step 3, selecting the specific rhetorical class. The options under Motivational are Motivation or Future. Since the cited work's result is used to justify why the current research is being done (because the mechanism is unclear), it's Motivation. Future would be if they were suggesting what to study next, but here it's about why their current work is needed. 

Checking the example for Motivation: "The explanation of the phenomena is not yet offered and the purpose of this work is to try to understand the mechanism..." which matches the structure here. The cited study shows a result, and the current paper is motivated by the lack of explanation. 

So the label should be Motivation.
