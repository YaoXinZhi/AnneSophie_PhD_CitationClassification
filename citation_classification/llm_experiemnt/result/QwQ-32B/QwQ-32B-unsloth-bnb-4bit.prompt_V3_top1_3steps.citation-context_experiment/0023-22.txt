Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to look at the given citation passage and figure out what the context is. The user provided the example where the citation is in a passage about phytoplasma strains in plants. The exact sentence is: "Fast multiplication rates and high concentration of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains have been reported in young developing leaves and roots of infected daisy plants (Wei et al., 2004; Saracco et al., 2006), although conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima @@CITATION@@."

Step 1 is to extract the context around the citation. The relevant part here is that there are conflicting results between the cited studies. The first part mentions reports from Wei and Saracco showing certain findings, but then contrasts that with "conflicting results" from the citation in question, which is about Euphorbia pulcherrima.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation is being used to point out a conflict between two studies. The key words here are "although conflicting results were described," which indicates a comparison between the cited works themselves, not with the current paper. So the general intent is Comparative.

Now, looking at the specific rhetorical classes under Comparative, the options are CoCoGM, CoCoRes, or CoCoXY. 

CoCoGM is about comparing goals or methods. Here, it's about the results conflicting. CoCoRes is comparing results directly. CoCoXY is comparing explanations or claims between the cited studies. The example given for CoCoXY is similar: two studies (Wei and Saracco vs. the cited one) are being contrasted in their findings. The current citation is part of a statement that says there's a conflict between the two sets of results. So this is comparing the results or explanations of the two cited studies (Wei/Saracco vs. the @@CITATION@@ one). Wait, actually, in the sentence, the citation is part of the conflicting results. Let me parse the sentence again. The main study (the one being cited here) is the one with Euphorbia pulcherrima, which has conflicting results compared to the previous ones. The authors are comparing the cited works (Wei and Saracco's findings vs. the @@CITATION@@ work's findings). So the citation is part of a comparison between two cited studies. That fits CoCoXY, which is when the citation is used to compare two cited studies with each other. The example given for CoCoXY is exactly this scenario: two studies (Wei et al. and Saracco et al.) are mentioned, and then another citation is used to show conflicting results, so the citation is part of a comparison between the cited works. Therefore, the specific class should be CoCoXY.
