Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. The user provided a scientific article citation passage and wants me to determine the rhetorical class of the citation marked as @@CITATION@@. The example given is about plant health, so I need to focus on that context.

First, I need to extract the context around @@CITATION@@. The user mentioned the citation is in a passage within backticks. Let me look at the example they provided. The passage says: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." 

Step 1: Extract the context. The relevant part here is "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." The key point is that the current study is referring to a previous description of their experimental setup. 

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The sentence is stating that the method or setup used in the current work was detailed in the cited work. This seems like the cited paper is being referenced for a method or procedure. 

Looking at the predefined classes, the Usage category is for when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup used in the current study. The example given for Usage is almost identical: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." 

So the general intent here is Technical, which maps to the Usage class. 

Step 3: Select the specific rhetorical class. Since the citation is directly pointing out that the experimental setup was described before, the correct label should be Usage.
