Okay, let's tackle this classification problem. The user provided a scientific article passage with a citation tagged as @@CITATION@@, and I need to determine the rhetorical class of that citation. 

First, I need to follow the steps outlined. The first step is to extract the context discussing the citation. The given passage is:

"The role of mycorrhizal fungi in enhancing plant resistance to pests has been extensively studied, with some studies showing significant improvements in pest resistance @@CITATION@@. However, other studies have reported inconsistent results, highlighting the variability in responses depending on fungal species and environmental conditions @@CITATION@@."

Wait, but the citation here is only one @@CITATION@@, right? Wait, actually looking back, the user's input might have two citations, but in the problem statement, the citation to be classified is the one tagged as @@CITATION@@. The example given in the user's message shows a passage with two citations. Let me check again:

The user's input is: 

"The role of mycorrhizal fungi in enhancing plant resistance to pests has been extensively studied, with some studies showing significant improvements in pest resistance @@CITATION@@. However, other studies have reported inconsistent results, highlighting the variability in responses depending on fungal species and environmental conditions @@CITATION@@."

Wait, but the problem says "the citation tagged @@CITATION@@", so maybe each @@CITATION@@ is separate, but in the example, there are two @@CITATION@@ instances. Hmm, maybe the user's example has two citations, but the task is to process each one individually. But since the user's input is the passage, perhaps the citation in question is the first one, or both? Wait, no, the user's instruction says "the citation @@CITATION@@", so likely each @@CITATION@@ in the passage is a separate citation, but in the given example, the user provided a passage with two @@CITATION@@ tags. However, the problem is to process each citation. Wait, the user's instruction is to process the citation in the given passage, which has two citations. But the user is asking for the classification of the citation tagged @@CITATION@@. The example given in the problem has two citations, but the user probably wants to process each citation separately. But in the current problem, the user's input is the passage with two @@CITATION@@ tags. However, the user might have intended each citation to be considered individually. Wait, perhaps the example given in the user's problem is the exact input, so we need to process each citation in the passage. However, the user's instruction says "the citation @@CITATION@@", so perhaps in the given passage, there is only one citation, but in the example provided by the user, there are two. Let me re-examine the user's exact input.

Wait, looking back, the user's input is:

The user's input passage is:

"The role of mycorrhizal fungi in enhancing plant resistance to pests has been extensively studied, with some studies showing significant improvements in pest resistance @@CITATION@@. However, other studies have reported inconsistent results, highlighting the variability in responses depending on fungal species and environmental conditions @@CITATION@@."

So there are two citations here, each marked with @@CITATION@@. The task is to assign a rhetorical class to each of these citations? Or to one of them? The problem says "the citation @@CITATION@@", so maybe the user is referring to one citation, but in the example given, there are two. Hmm. Wait, perhaps the user's example is part of the problem, but the actual task here is to process the given passage's citations. Wait, the user's instruction says "the citation @@CITATION@@", so maybe the actual task is to process each citation in the given passage. But the user's instructions might have an example where the citation is in the context of "some studies" and "other studies", each with a citation. 

Assuming that the user wants to process each citation separately, but the problem here is to do it for one citation at a time. Let me proceed step by step.

First, the first citation is in the sentence: "with some studies showing significant improvements in pest resistance @@CITATION@@." 

The second citation is in "However, other studies have reported inconsistent results... @@CITATION@@."

The user's task is to classify each citation. However, in the problem presented here, perhaps the user is only asking for one of them? Wait, the user's exact input is the passage with two citations, but the problem is to classify the citation(s) in the passage. Since the user's instruction says "the citation @@CITATION@@", perhaps each occurrence is to be considered separately. But since the user is asking for the output of the single most appropriate label, perhaps they are asking for one citation's classification. But in the given example, there are two citations. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the example, but the actual task is to process the first citation. Alternatively, perhaps the user's example is a combined scenario where both citations are part of the same context. 

Alternatively, maybe the example is constructed such that the first citation is @@CITATION@@ and the second is another, but the user is presenting an example where two citations are in the passage. However, the problem is to process each citation individually, so I need to handle each citation separately. But the user's instructions say to process the citation in the passage, so perhaps each citation in the passage is to be classified. 

But given that the user's output requires only one label, perhaps in this example, the user is showing a scenario where two citations are in the passage, but the task is to process each one. However, since the user's input here is the passage with two citations, but the problem is to process one citation, maybe the user intended to have each citation considered in separate instances, but in this case, perhaps the user is presenting a combined example. 

Alternatively, maybe the user's problem is that the citation is the first one, and the second is just part of the passage. Let me re-express the given passage again. 

The passage is:

"The role of mycorrhizal fungi in enhancing plant resistance to pests has been extensively studied, with some studies showing significant improvements in pest resistance @@CITATION@@. However, other studies have reported inconsistent results, highlighting the variability in responses depending on fungal species and environmental conditions @@CITATION@@."

So, the first citation is supporting the first part (some studies show improvements), the second citation supports the second part (other studies show inconsistent results). 

Now, the task is to classify each citation. Let's take the first citation first. 

Step 1: Extract context for the first citation. The sentence is: "with some studies showing significant improvements in pest resistance @@CITATION@@", so the context is that the citation supports the statement that some studies showed improvements. 

Step 2: Determine the general intent. Since the citation is used to support the claim made by the citing paper (i.e., that some studies showed improvements), this would be a Support or Similar class? Wait, the example for Support is "the citation is used to support, or confirm the work, result or finding of the citing authors." Here, the citing authors are stating that some studies show improvements, and they cite the work to support that assertion. So this would be Support, because the cited work's findings are being used to back up the citing authors' statement. 

Alternatively, the Similar class is when pointing out a similarity between cited and citing work. But here, the citing authors are just citing existing studies to back their own claim, so Support is more appropriate. 

For the second citation: "However, other studies have reported inconsistent results... @@CITATION@@", the citation here is supporting the statement that other studies found inconsistent results. Again, this is the authors citing studies that found inconsistent results to support their claim about variability. So again, that would be Support. Wait, but the example for Support is when the citing authors are supporting their own work with the cited. Here, the citing authors are reporting that other studies found inconsistent results, so they are using the cited work to support their statement about variability, so it's still Support. 

Alternatively, perhaps the second citation is contrasting with the first? But the general intent for each citation individually would be Support. 

Alternatively, the comparison between the two citations (the first study showing improvements, the second showing inconsistent results) could be a CoCoRes (Comparison of Results), but that would be if the citing paper is comparing the two cited studies. However, in this case, the citations are each supporting different points made by the citing authors. The first citation supports the existence of studies showing improvement, the second supports the existence of studies showing inconsistency. The authors are using both citations to highlight variability, so each citation is supporting their own statement. 

Wait, but the second citation's context is part of a sentence that starts with "However," which might indicate a contrast between the two studies. But each citation is individually supporting their respective statements. 

Alternatively, the entire passage is comparing two sets of studies (the cited works), so maybe the two citations are being compared to each other. In that case, the rhetorical class for each citation would be part of a CoCoRes (Comparison of Results) because the citing paper is contrasting the results of the two studies. 

Wait, let me read the example for CoCoRes: "the citation is used to directly compare or contrast the results or findings of the cited work with those of the citing paper." Wait no, the example given for CoCoRes is when comparing with the citing paper's results. Wait, the definitions:

CoCoRes: "the citation is used to directly compare or contrast the results or findings of the cited work with those of the citing paper."

Wait, no. Wait, looking back:

The definitions:

CoCoGM: comparison of goals or methods between cited and citing.

CoCoRes: comparing results between cited and citing.

CoCoXY: comparing two cited studies with each other, not with the citing paper.

Ah, right. The example for CoCoXY is when two cited studies are compared. 

In the given passage, the authors mention two studies (the first citation and the second citation) that have conflicting results. The sentence structure is "some studies show X @@CITATION@@", "other studies show Y @@CITATION@@", and the authors are pointing out that variability exists. Here, the two citations are being compared to each other to highlight their differing results. Therefore, each citation is part of a CoCoRes? Or CoCoXY?

Wait, the key here is whether the comparison is between the cited works themselves or between the cited and the citing. 

In this case, the citing paper is not presenting their own results here; they are just summarizing existing studies. The two citations are cited to show that there are conflicting results in the literature. The authors are using the two citations to contrast each other, hence it's a comparison between the two cited works. 

Therefore, the rhetorical class for each citation here would be CoCoXY, since they are being compared with each other. 

Wait, the example for CoCoXY is: "Fast multiplication rates... although conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma... @@CITATION@@." So in that example, two citations are mentioned (Wei et al. and Saracco et al.) and then another citation is contrasted with them. 

In the user's example passage here, the two citations are part of the same sentence structure contrasting their results. The authors are pointing out that some studies show X (first citation), others show Y (second citation), thus highlighting variability. 

Therefore, each citation's role is to be part of a comparison between the cited studies. So the rhetorical class would be CoCoXY for both citations. 

However, the problem states that each citation is to be classified individually. So for the first citation, the context is "some studies show X" and the citation is there to support that claim, but since it's part of a contrast with another citation, maybe it's part of a CoCoXY. 

Alternatively, perhaps the first citation is used to support the existence of studies showing X, and the second to support studies showing Y, but the comparison is between the two cited works. Therefore, the rhetorical class for each citation would be CoCoXY because they are being compared to each other. 

Alternatively, if each citation is individually being used to support the authors' point (that there are conflicting results), then each is a Support for the authors' statement. But the authors' statement is that there's variability because some studies show X, others show Y. The citations are used to support the existence of those differing results, so perhaps the main intent is to support the authors' claim of variability. But the question is about the intent of citing each individual citation. 

Wait, the task says to assign the rhetorical class for the citation tagged @@CITATION@@", so each citation in the passage would be considered individually. Let's focus on the first citation first. 

First citation's context: "some studies show significant improvements... @@CITATION@@", so the citation is supporting the existence of those studies that found improvements. The authors are using this citation to back up their statement that such studies exist. Therefore, this is a Support class, because the citation is used to support the citing authors' assertion. 

Similarly, the second citation supports the authors' statement about inconsistent results. So each citation is individually a Support. 

But then why is the second part introduced with "However"? The contrast is between the two cited studies, but each citation is supporting the authors' point that there are differing results. The authors are using both citations to support their own point that there's variability, so each citation is a Support for their argument. 

Alternatively, maybe the comparison between the two cited studies is the key here, making it CoCoXY. 

The example for CoCoXY is when two cited studies are compared. The user's example for CoCoXY is: "Fast multiplication rates... (Wei et al., 2004; Saracco et al., 2006), although conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima @@CITATION@@", so here two citations are mentioned (Wei and Saracco) and then another citation is contrasted with them. The rhetorical class for the third citation (the one with @@CITATION@@) would be CoCoXY because it's contrasting with the previous ones. 

In the user's current example, the two citations are each supporting different results, and the authors are pointing out the variability. The citations are used to show that different studies have conflicting results, so the comparison is between the cited works themselves. Therefore, each citation is part of a CoCoXY scenario. 

Wait, but the first citation is cited to show some studies found X, the second to show others found Y. The authors are contrasting the two studies. So each citation is part of a comparison between the cited works. Therefore, the rhetorical class for each would be CoCoXY. 

Alternatively, maybe the first citation is Support and the second is also Support, but together they form a CoCoRes when considered together. But the task is to classify each citation individually. 

Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous. Let me re-examine the definitions:

CoCoXY: the citation is used to compare or contrast two cited studies with each other — not with the citing paper. 

In this case, the citing paper is not presenting their own results here; they are just discussing existing studies. The two citations are being contrasted to show that there are conflicting results in the literature. Therefore, each citation is part of a comparison between the two cited studies. Hence, the rhetorical class would be CoCoXY for each citation. 

Therefore, the correct label for each citation would be CoCoXY. 

Wait, but in the example given for CoCoXY, the structure is that two studies are mentioned (without citations) and then another study is cited as conflicting. Here, both citations are being contrasted. 

Alternatively, the first citation is supporting the authors' statement of "some studies show X", so that's Support, and the second citation is supporting "other studies show Y", which is also Support, but the contrast between them is part of the overall context, but each citation individually is being used to support their respective statements. 

The question is whether the rhetorical class is determined based on the citation's role in the context. If the citation is used to support the author's claim that some studies found X, then it's Support. The fact that another citation is presented to contrast with it doesn't change the role of each individual citation; each is supporting the author's statement about that particular result. 

Alternatively, if the authors are pointing out that there are conflicting results between the two studies, then the comparison is between the cited studies, so each citation's role is to be part of that comparison, hence CoCoXY. 

I think the key is whether the citation is being used to support the author's statement or to compare with another cited work. 

In the sentence structure: "some studies show X @@CITATION@@. However, other studies show Y @@CITATION@@." 

Each citation is supporting the author's statement about that group of studies. The contrast between the two is part of the authors' argument about variability, but each citation's role is to back up the respective claim. Therefore, each is a Support. 

Alternatively, the authors are using the two citations to show that there is a conflict between them, so each citation is being compared with the other. 

Hmm, this is tricky. Let me look at the example given for CoCoXY again:

Example: "Fast multiplication rates and high concentration of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains have been reported in young developing leaves and roots of infected daisy plants (Wei et al., 2004; Saracco et al., 2006), although conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima @@CITATION@@."

Here, the first two citations (Wei and Saracco) are presented as supporting one set of results, and the third citation is contrasted with them. The @@CITATION@@ here is the conflicting one, so its role is CoCoXY because it's contrasting with the previous two. 

In the user's example, the structure is similar: two citations are presented in opposition. The first citation is part of "some studies show X", the second "other studies show Y". The authors are contrasting the two cited studies. Therefore, each citation is part of a comparison between the cited works. 

Hence, the first citation's role is to be compared with the second, so each citation's rhetorical class is CoCoXY. 

Alternatively, the first citation is only supporting the first part, and the second the second part, and the comparison is between the two cited studies, so each citation's role is part of a CoCoRes (if compared to the citing paper's results) but since the citing paper isn't presenting their own results here, it's CoCoXY. 

Yes, since the comparison is between the two cited studies, not between cited and citing, it's CoCoXY. 

Therefore, the correct label for each citation is CoCoXY. 

Wait, but the task is to process the citation tagged @@CITATION@@. In the user's input, there are two @@CITATION@@ instances. The user's instruction says "the citation @@CITATION@@", so perhaps each citation should be processed separately. But in the given problem, the user is providing an example where two citations are in the passage, but the task is to classify each one. Since the user's output requires only one label, perhaps they are asking for each citation's classification. 

Alternatively, maybe the user's example has a typo and there's only one citation. Let me check again. 

The user's input passage is written as:

"The role of mycorrhizal fungi in enhancing plant resistance to pests has been extensively studied, with some studies showing significant improvements in pest resistance @@CITATION@@. However, other studies have reported inconsistent results, highlighting the variability in responses depending on fungal species and environmental conditions @@CITATION@@."

So two @@CITATION@@ tags. The problem is to classify each. But the user's instruction says to return only one label. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the example and there's only one citation. Alternatively, perhaps the user is asking for the classification of both citations together, but the output requires a single label. 

Alternatively, perhaps in the user's problem, the citation in question is the first one, so we can focus on that. Let's proceed with the first citation first. 

First citation's context: "some studies show significant improvements in pest resistance @@CITATION@@", so the citation is supporting the existence of such studies. Therefore, the rhetorical class is Support. 

Wait, but the example for Support is when the citation supports the citing authors' work. Here, the authors are citing to support their statement that some studies found improvements, so that is indeed Support. 

Alternatively, maybe it's Basis? No, because it's not foundational to their current research. 

Motivation? Not really. 

Usage? No, it's not a method or tool. 

Weakness? No, it's not criticizing. 

Neutral? No, it's supporting their point. 

So Support is correct. 

The second citation's context is similar: "other studies reported inconsistent results @@CITATION@@", so Support again. 

But if the two citations are being contrasted, then perhaps each is part of a CoCoXY. 

Hmm. This is a bit ambiguous, but given the definitions, if the authors are contrasting two cited studies, then each citation is part of a CoCoXY comparison. 

Alternatively, the authors are just citing studies to support their own point about variability, so each citation is Support. 

The example for CoCoXY involves contrasting two cited studies, which seems to fit the user's example. 

In the user's example, the authors state that some studies found X, others found Y, and the citations are for each of those groups. The comparison is between the cited studies, so each citation is part of a CoCoXY. 

Therefore, the label for each citation should be CoCoXY. 

Alternatively, the first citation is not being compared with the second in terms of their own goals or methods, but their results. 

The definition of CoCoRes is when the cited work's results are compared with the citing paper's results. Since the citing paper here isn't presenting their own results, but discussing others', the comparison between the two citations would be CoCoXY. 

Yes, so the correct label is CoCoXY. 

Therefore, the answer should be CoCoXY.

CoCoXY
