Okay, let me tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand the task. The user wants me to classify a citation in a scientific article based on its rhetorical class. The citation is tagged as @@CITATION@@ within a backtick-delimited passage. The steps are to extract the context around the citation, determine the general intent, and then pick the specific class from the predefined list.

The example given is about plant health, so I need to focus on that domain. Let me start with the first step: extracting the context discussing the citation. The user provided a passage in backticks, so I should look for the part that immediately surrounds @@CITATION@@ to get the relevant context. 

Next, the general intent. The options are Foundational, Comparative, Motivational, Supportive, Technical, Critical/Analytical, or Descriptive. Each of these maps to a more specific class. For example, if it's foundational, it's Basis. If comparative, then it could be CoCoGM, CoCoRes, or CoCoXY depending on whether it's comparing goals/methods, results, or explanations.

The third step is selecting the specific class based on the definitions. Let me recall the definitions again:

- **Basis**: The citation is the foundation of the current research.
- **CoCoGM**: Comparing goals or methods with the cited work.
- **CoCoRes**: Comparing results with the cited work.
- **CoCoXY**: Comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies.
- **Motivation**: Justifying why the current research is done.
- **Future**: Suggesting future directions.
- **Support**: Supporting the citing authors' work with the citation.
- **Similar**: Pointing out similarity between cited and current work.
- **Usage**: Using a method/tool from the cited work.
- **Weakness**: Criticizing the cited work.
- **Neutral**: Descriptive use without supporting, etc.

Now, looking at the example provided by the user: the citation is in a sentence that says, "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly... is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks... @@CITATION@@." 

The key here is the word "supported." The current study's finding is being supported by the cited work. According to the definitions, **Support** is when the citation supports the citing authors' work. The example given under Support matches this scenario exactly. The citation here is used to back up their own results, so the general intent would be Supportive, leading to the specific class Support.
