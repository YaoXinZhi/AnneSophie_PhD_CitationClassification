Okay, let's tackle this classification problem. The user provided a citation passage and wants me to determine the rhetorical class of the citation @@CITATION@@. The example given is about plant health, so I need to focus on that context.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage says: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." 

Step 1: The context here is straightforward. The sentence is stating that the experimental setup they used was detailed in a previous study. The key phrase here is "described in detail previously," which indicates that the current study is using the setup from the cited work.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. Since the citation is referring to a method or setup that's being used in the current study, this seems like the "Technical" category. The predefined technical class maps to the "Usage" label. 

Step 3: Looking at the definitions, the Usage class is when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup used in the current study. The example given for Usage is almost identical: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." So this fits perfectly under Usage. 

I should check if there's any other possible class. Could it be Support? Support is for when the citation supports the current findings. But here, it's about using the setup, not supporting a result. Basis is about foundational work, but the sentence doesn't indicate that the cited work is the basis for their research, just that they used their setup. So yes, Usage is correct.
