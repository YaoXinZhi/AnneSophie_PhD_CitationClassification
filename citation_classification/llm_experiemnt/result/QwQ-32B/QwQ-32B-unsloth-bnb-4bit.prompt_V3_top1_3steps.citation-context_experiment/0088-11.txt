Okay, let's tackle this classification problem. The user provided a scientific article citation passage and wants me to determine the rhetorical class of the @@CITATION@@. 

First, I need to follow the steps outlined. The passage given is:

"The study of plant pathogen interactions has seen significant advancements, particularly with the discovery of novel resistance genes in wheat @@CITATION@@. However, the application of these genes in field conditions remains challenging due to environmental variability. Our research builds on this foundation to explore......"

Step 1: Extract the context discussing the citation. The relevant part here is "the discovery of novel resistance genes in wheat @@CITATION@@." The sentence says that the current study builds on this foundation. 

Step 2: Identify the general intent. Since the current research is building on the cited work's foundation, this seems foundational. The cited work introduced something that the current study is using as a basis.

Step 3: Select the specific rhetorical class. The example for Basis mentions that it's when the citation is the intellectual foundation. The sentence here says "builds on this foundation," which directly points to the cited work as the basis. So, the answer should be Basis.

Basis
