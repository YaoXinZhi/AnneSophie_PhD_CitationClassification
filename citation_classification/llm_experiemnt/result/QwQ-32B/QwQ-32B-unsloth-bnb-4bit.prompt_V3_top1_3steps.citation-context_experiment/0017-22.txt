Okay, let's tackle this classification task. The user provided a passage with a citation tagged @@CITATION@@, and I need to figure out the rhetorical class of that citation. Let me start by following the steps outlined.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The given passage is:

"Investigations on the effects of magnetic treatment on calcium carbonate precipitation revealed varying results. Some studies reported enhanced precipitation rates @@CITATION@@, while others observed reduced scaling @@CITATION@@. Our current study builds on these findings to explore the underlying mechanisms."

Wait, the user's example might have multiple citations, but in the problem statement, the citation to classify is @@CITATION@@. Let me check again. The user's actual input might be different, but in their example, they have two citations. But according to the problem, I should focus on the one tagged with @@CITATION@@. Let me assume the example given is the actual input here. 

Looking at the context: The sentence says, "Some studies reported enhanced precipitation rates @@CITATION@@, while others observed reduced scaling @@CITATION@@." The citation here is part of a comparison between different studies' results. The first citation is for studies showing enhanced rates, the second for reduced scaling. The current study builds on these findings. 

So, the citation is being used to compare the results of different studies. The key part here is "some studies... while others..." which indicates a comparison between the cited works themselves. 

Step 2: Identify the general intent. Since the citations are being used to contrast results between studies, that's a comparative intent. The options under comparative are CoCoGM, CoCoRes, or CoCoXY. 

Now, looking at the definitions:

- CoCoRes is for comparing the results of the cited work with the citing paper. But in this case, the citing paper is comparing two cited works (enhanced vs reduced) without directly comparing their own results yet. Wait, the example given for CoCoXY is when two cited studies are compared with each other, not with the citing paper. 

The example for CoCoXY is: "Fast multiplication rates... although conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma... @@CITATION@@." Here, the citation is pointing out conflicting results between two studies. Similarly, in the given context, the two citations are showing conflicting results (enhanced vs reduced scaling), so the citation is part of a comparison between the cited works themselves. 

Therefore, the general intent is Comparative, specifically CoCoXY because it's comparing explanations or results between the cited studies. 

Step 3: Assign the specific label. The correct class here would be CoCoXY because the citation is used to highlight a contrast or comparison between the cited studies' results.
