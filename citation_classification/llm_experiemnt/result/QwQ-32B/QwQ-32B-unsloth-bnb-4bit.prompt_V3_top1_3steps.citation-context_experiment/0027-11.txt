Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user provided a citation context and wants me to classify the citation's rhetorical class. 

First, I need to extract the context around @@CITATION@@. The given passage is: 

"However, the effect of mycorrhizal colonization on plant resistance to pathogens under drought conditions remains poorly understood @@CITATION@@. Our study aims to address this knowledge gap by examining the interaction between arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and plant defense mechanisms in water-stressed environments."

Step 1: Extract the context. The relevant part here is "the effect of mycorrhizal colonization on plant resistance to pathogens under drought conditions remains poorly understood" followed by the citation. The next sentence mentions that their study addresses this knowledge gap. 

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation is pointing out a knowledge gap that the current study is addressing. That sounds like the citation is used to justify why the current research is being done. The example for Motivation mentions identifying a knowledge gap, so that fits.

Step 3: Choose the specific class. The options under Motivational are Motivation and Future. Since the citation is directly justifying the current study's purpose by pointing out a gap, it's Motivation. Future would be if they suggested directions after their work, but here it's about the motivation for their own research. 

So the label should be Motivation.
