Okay, let's tackle this classification task step by step. The user provided a citation passage and wants me to determine the rhetorical class of the citation @@CITATION@@. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage given is: 

"Previous studies have shown that magnetic treatment can reduce scale formation in hard water systems @@CITATION@@. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear, prompting further investigation into the role of magnetic fields on crystallization processes."

Step 1: Extract the context. The relevant part here is "Previous studies have shown that magnetic treatment can reduce scale formation in hard water systems @@CITATION@@. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear, prompting further investigation..." 

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation is referring to prior work that demonstrated an effect (reducing scale), but the current study is investigating the mechanism. The key part is "However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear, prompting further investigation..." This seems to indicate that the current research is motivated by a gap in the cited work's findings. The citation is pointing out that previous results exist, but there's a need to understand why or how, leading to the current study. 

Looking at the general intent categories: Motivational. Because the citation is highlighting a knowledge gap (mechanism unknown) that motivates the current research. 

Now, looking at the specific classes under Motivational: Motivation or Future. The example for Motivation is when the citation justifies the current research by a knowledge gap. The example given in Motivation is similar: "The explanation of the phenomena is not yet offered and the purpose of this work is to try to understand the mechanism..." which matches the context here. The citation here is used to state that prior work showed an effect, but the mechanism isn't known, hence motivating the current study. So the specific class should be Motivation.
