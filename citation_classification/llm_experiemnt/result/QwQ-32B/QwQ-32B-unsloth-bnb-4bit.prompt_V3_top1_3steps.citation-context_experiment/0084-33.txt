Okay, let's tackle this classification problem. The user provided a scientific article passage with a citation tagged as @@CITATION@@, and I need to determine the rhetorical class of that citation based on the context. Let me go through the steps one by one.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage given is: 

"Despite the widespread application of CRISPR-based methods in plant pathology, their efficiency in fungal pathogens remains inconsistent @@CITATION@@. This study aimed to address this gap by optimizing guide RNA design parameters."

So the citation is mentioned in the sentence: "Despite the widespread application of CRISPR-based methods in plant pathology, their efficiency in fungal pathogens remains inconsistent @@CITATION@@." 

Step 1 is to extract the relevant context. The key part here is the statement about the inconsistency in efficiency of CRISPR methods in fungal pathogens, which the citation supports. The citation is pointing out that there's an existing problem or knowledge gap.

Moving to Step 2: Identify the general intent. The sentence mentions that the efficiency is inconsistent, and the current study aims to address this gap. The citation here is likely highlighting a knowledge gap or a problem that the current study is trying to solve. That would fall under the "Motivational" category since it's justifying why the current research is being done. 

Now, looking at the specific rhetorical classes under Motivational: the options are Motivation or Future. The example for Motivation is when the citation points out a knowledge gap or need. Since the citation here is pointing out the inconsistency as a problem that the current study addresses, that's exactly the "Motivation" class. The Future class is for suggesting directions for future research, but here the current study is addressing the gap, so it's more about motivating the current work rather than suggesting future steps.

So the final label should be "Motivation".
