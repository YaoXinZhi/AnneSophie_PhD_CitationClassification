Okay, let me tackle this step by step. First, I need to look at the user's input and follow the instructions carefully. The task is to classify a citation reference in a scientific article passage into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. The passage provided is:

"However, the mechanisms underlying this resistance remain unclear @@CITATION@@, prompting further investigation into the role of root exudates."

Alright, starting with Step 1: Extract the context discussing the citation. The relevant part here is "However, the mechanisms underlying this resistance remain unclear @@CITATION@@, prompting further investigation into the role of root exudates." So the citation is pointing out that the mechanisms are unclear, which leads to more research.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation is highlighting a gap in knowledgeâ€”since the mechanisms are unclear, it's motivating further study. That points towards the Motivational category. The options under Motivational are Motivation or Future. The example for Motivation is about justifying the current research due to a knowledge gap, which fits here. The citation is used to explain why the current research is needed, so that's Motivation.

Step 3: Select the specific class. The options under Motivational are Motivation and Future. The example for Future is suggesting directions for future research, like the peptide's broader applicability. Here, the citation is about the lack of clarity leading to the need for the current study's investigation. That aligns more with Motivation because it's justifying the current research's necessity due to an existing gap. So the answer should be Motivation.
