Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user provided a task where I need to classify a citation in a scientific article passage. The citation is tagged as @@CITATION@@, and I have to figure out the correct rhetorical class from the given list.

First, the context given is: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." 

Step 1 is to extract the context discussing the citation. The sentence here is straightforward: the authors are saying that their experimental setup was described before in the cited work. So the key part here is "experimental set-up was described in detail previously."

Step 2 is to identify the general intent. The sentence is stating that they used a method or setup from the cited work. Looking at the definitions, the 'Usage' class is for when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup used in the current study. The example given for Usage is exactly similar: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." 

So the general intent here is Technical, which maps to the Usage class. 

Double-checking other options: It's not a comparison (CoCoGM/CoCoRes/CoCoXY), not foundational (Basis), not motivating or future research, not supporting or similar, nor a weakness. It's purely stating that they used a setup from the cited work. Therefore, the correct label should be Usage.
