Okay, let me tackle this step by step. First, I need to look at the provided passage and figure out what the citation is referring to. The user mentioned that the citation is tagged as @@CITATION@@ within backticks. Let me check the example given in the problem.

Wait, the user hasn't provided the actual passage here. Hmm, maybe I need to look back. Wait, no, the user's input is the problem setup. Oh right, the user is giving me a general task, but in the actual use case, there would be a specific passage with @@CITATION@@. Since this is the example, maybe the user is testing if I follow the steps correctly. Wait, perhaps there's a sample passage I missed? Let me re-read the user's message.

Looking again, the user's message includes the context and task but not an example passage. Wait, maybe the example is in the definitions? The examples under each class have citations like @@CITATION@@, but those are examples. The actual task requires the user to input a specific passage with @@CITATION@@, but in this case, maybe the user is asking me to process a specific example. Wait, perhaps I misread. The user's actual input might have been a specific passage in backticks with @@CITATION@@, but in this case, the user is providing the instructions. Wait, maybe the user is giving an example of how to format the question, but the actual input here is the problem setup. Hmm, this is confusing. Wait, perhaps the user is asking me to process their own example? Let me check again.

Wait, the user's message is structured as a task for me to perform. They provided the context and the steps, and then specified the output format. But the actual test case would be a passage with @@CITATION@@. Since in this instance, the user hasn't provided a specific passage with @@CITATION@@, maybe this is a meta-example? Wait, no, the user is expecting me to process the given example. Wait, perhaps the user included an example in the definitions. Let me check the example under Support: the example says "participants did not distinguish between personal interests and values as reasons for disputes, nor between competence and methods" and cites @@CITATION@@. But that's just an example of how the Support class works. The actual task requires processing a user-provided passage with @@CITATION@@, but in this case, maybe the user is providing a test case where the passage is part of their input. Wait, looking back at the user's message, the user's input is the entire setup, but perhaps the actual test case is missing here. Wait, no, the user's message ends with the output format instructions. Hmm, perhaps this is an error, but given the instructions, I have to proceed with the information provided.

Wait, maybe I misread the user's input. Let me check again. The user's message starts with "You are a classifier..." and then provides the task, steps, definitions, and output format. The user is asking me to simulate the process for a given example, but perhaps in the actual scenario, the user would provide a specific passage. Since in this case, the user hasn't provided a specific passage with @@CITATION@@, maybe this is a test to ensure that I follow the steps correctly. Alternatively, perhaps the example given in the Support class is the one to process. Let me check the example under Support again. The example is: “All subscales were consistent with previous research, particularly that of @@CITATION@@ also using a U.S. sample; as before, participants did not distinguish between personal interests and values as reasons for disputes, nor between competence and methods.” Here, the citation is supporting the current findings by aligning with previous research. So the rhetorical class here would be Support. So, following the steps:

Step 1: The context around the citation is that the current study's subscales are consistent with previous research, specifically the cited work using a U.S. sample. 

Step 2: The general intent here is supportive, as the citation is used to support the current findings.

Step 3: The specific class is Support. So the final label would be Support. 

Alternatively, if the example under CoCoRes: “The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@.” Here, the intent is comparative, specifically comparing results, so CoCoRes.

But the user's actual question is to process a given passage, but in this case, since there's no specific passage, perhaps the user is asking me to outline the process. However, given the instructions, the user wants me to do this for a specific input. Since the user didn't provide a passage, maybe this is a test, and I should refer to the example given in the problem. Wait, the user's exact input includes the example under each class. For instance, under Support, the example passage is given. So maybe the user wants me to process that example. Let me assume that the user is providing the Support example as the input, and I need to apply the steps to it.

Taking the Support example: The passage is "All subscales were consistent with previous research, particularly that of @@CITATION@@ also using a U.S. sample; as before, participants did not distinguish between personal interests and values as reasons for disputes, nor between competence and methods."

Step 1: Extract context around @@CITATION@@: The current study's subscales are consistent with previous research, especially the cited work using a U.S. sample. The citation is mentioned in the context of agreement with the current findings.

Step 2: General intent is supportive, as it's supporting the current results by citing prior work that aligns with them.

Step 3: The specific class is Support. So the output would be "Support".

Alternatively, if the example under CoCoRes is taken: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@."

Step 1: The context is comparing the current results with those of the cited work, noting a substantial difference.

Step 2: The intent is comparative, specifically comparing results (CoCoRes).

Step 3: So the label would be CoCoRes.

But the user's actual input doesn't specify which example to use. Since the user is asking for a general approach, but in the problem's context, perhaps they want me to process the example given in the task description. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since the user provided the Support example, let me proceed with that.

Wait, the user's task says "You are a classifier that assigns to a rhetorical class the citation tagged @@CITATION@@ in a scientific article passage delimited by backticks." So the user would provide a passage with backticks and @@CITATION@@, but in this case, the user's message doesn't include such a passage. Therefore, this might be an error, but perhaps I should proceed with one of the examples provided in the problem's own definitions to demonstrate the process.

Alternatively, maybe I should treat the user's message as a test case where the citation is in the example under Support. Let's proceed with that.

So, applying the steps to the Support example:

Step 1: Extract the context discussing the citation. The relevant part is "All subscales were consistent with previous research, particularly that of @@CITATION@@ also using a U.S. sample; as before, participants did not distinguish between personal interests and values as reasons for disputes, nor between competence and methods." The key part is "consistent with previous research" and "as before", indicating alignment with the cited work.

Step 2: General intent is supportive, as the citation is used to support the current findings by showing agreement.

Step 3: The specific class is Support.

Therefore, the final label is Support.

Alternatively, if I pick the CoCoRes example:

Passage: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@."

Step 1: The context is comparing current results with those in the citation, noting a difference.

Step 2: Comparative intent, specifically comparing results (CoCoRes).

Step 3: Label CoCoRes.

But since the user hasn't provided a specific example, I need to choose one of the examples given. Since the Support example is under the Support definition, and the user's task requires me to follow the steps, I'll proceed with that as an example. Hence, the answer would be Support.
