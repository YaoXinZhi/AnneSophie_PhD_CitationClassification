Okay, let me tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand what the user is asking. They want me to classify a citation in a scientific article's passage according to a predefined list of rhetorical classes. The citation is tagged as @@CITATION@@, and I have to determine which class it belongs to based on the context provided.

The steps given are: extract the context around the citation, identify the general intent, and then assign the most appropriate fine-grained label. Let's start with the example provided by the user. The passage is:

"Previous studies have shown that magnetic treatment can influence the crystallization process of calcium carbonate @@CITATION@@. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear, which is why our study aims to investigate the structural changes at the atomic level."

First, I need to extract the context discussing the citation. The sentence with the citation is "Previous studies have shown that magnetic treatment can influence the crystallization process of calcium carbonate @@CITATION@@." The following sentence says, "However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear, which is why our study aims to investigate the structural changes at the atomic level." 

The general intent here seems to be that the cited work provided prior findings (the influence of magnetic treatment on crystallization), but there's a gap in understanding the mechanism. The current study is motivated by this gap. 

Looking at the general intent categories, this seems like "Motivational" because the citation is used to justify why the current research is being doneâ€”pointing out a knowledge gap. The example for Motivation mentions identifying a knowledge gap or open question, which matches here. 

Now, checking the specific classes under Motivational: the options are Motivation or Future. Since the citation is used to highlight a gap that the current study addresses, it's "Motivation." Future would be if it's suggesting directions for future research, which isn't the case here. The current study is motivated by the cited work's findings and the remaining gap. 

Therefore, the correct label should be Motivation.
