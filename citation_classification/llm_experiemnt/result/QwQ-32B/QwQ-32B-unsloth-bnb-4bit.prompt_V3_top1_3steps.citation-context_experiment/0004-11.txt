Okay, let me start by looking at the user's problem. They want me to classify a citation in a scientific article's passage based on the context provided. The citation is tagged as @@CITATION@@, and I need to figure out which rhetorical class it belongs to from the predefined list. 

First, I need to follow the steps outlined. The first step is to extract the context discussing the citation. The user provided a passage within backticks, so I should focus on that. The passage says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@."

Alright, so the key part here is that the current study's results are being compared to the cited work's results. The phrase "substantially differ from the results" stands out. That suggests a direct comparison of findings between the two studies.

Next, I need to identify the general intent. Since they are comparing results, according to the guidelines, that falls under the Comparative category. The options under Comparative are CoCoGM, CoCoRes, or CoCoXY. 

Looking at the definitions:
- CoCoRes is for comparing results or findings directly between the cited and citing paper. 
- CoCoGM is about comparing goals or methods. 
- CoCoXY is when comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies, not involving the citing paper.

In this case, the current paper is contrasting their results with those of the cited work. The example given for CoCoRes is almost identical: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments... @@CITATION@@." That's exactly the structure here. So CoCoRes seems right. 

I should check the other options just to be sure. The passage isn't discussing methods or goals, so CoCoGM is out. CoCoXY involves comparing two cited studies, but here it's the current work vs. the cited one. So CoCoRes is the best fit. 

Therefore, the specific rhetorical class here is CoCoRes.
