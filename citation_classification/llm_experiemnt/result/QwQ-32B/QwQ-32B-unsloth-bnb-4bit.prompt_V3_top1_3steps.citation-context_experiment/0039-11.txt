Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to look at the given citation passage and figure out what the context is around @@CITATION@@. The user provided the example where the passage is about phytoplasma in plants. The specific sentence says: "Fast multiplication rates and high concentration of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains have been reported in young developing leaves and roots of infected daisy plants (Wei et al., 2004; Saracco et al., 2006), although conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima @@CITATION@@."

Step 1: Extract the context. The relevant part here is the comparison between the studies by Wei et al. and Saracco et al., which reported certain findings, versus the cited work that showed conflicting results. The key phrase here is "although conflicting results were described," which indicates a contrast between the cited studies.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. Since the citation is comparing two studies (the ones mentioned before the citation and the one in @@CITATION@@), this seems like a comparative intent. The comparison is about their results or explanations, not the current paper's methods or goals.

Step 3: Choose the specific class. The options under comparative are CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY. CoCoRes is for comparing results directly. But here, the conflict is in the findings or explanations between the cited works themselves. The example given for CoCoXY mentions comparing two cited studies with each other, which matches here. The citation is pointing out that the current study's results contrast with previous ones, but more precisely, the citation is used to show that there's a conflict between the cited studies (Wei, Saracco vs. the one in @@CITATION@@). So CoCoXY is about comparing explanations or claims between two cited works. The phrase "conflicting results" refers to differing conclusions or explanations between the studies, so CoCoXY fits here.
