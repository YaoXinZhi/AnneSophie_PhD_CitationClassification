Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user provided a query where I need to classify a citation in a scientific article related to plant health. The citation is tagged as @@CITATION@@ within a backtick-delimited passage. The task is to determine the rhetorical class of that citation using the predefined list.

First, I need to follow the steps outlined. Let me start with Step 1: Extract the context discussing the citation. The user hasn't provided the actual passage yet, so maybe they included it in their message? Wait, looking back, the user's input includes the context with backticks. Let me check again.

Ah, here's the passage: 

`Previous studies have shown that plant pathogens can significantly reduce crop yields. A notable example is the work by Smith et al. @@CITATION@@, which demonstrated a 40% yield loss in wheat due to Fusarium head blight. This finding is critical for developing resistant varieties. However, our study builds on this by examining the impact of varying nitrogen levels on disease severity, as nitrogen management is a key factor in sustainable agriculture practices.`

Okay, so the citation is in the middle there. The context around @@CITATION@@ is "Smith et al. @@CITATION@@, which demonstrated a 40% yield loss in wheat due to Fusarium head blight. This finding is critical for developing resistant varieties. However, our study builds on this by examining the impact of varying nitrogen levels on disease severity..."

Step 1: Extract the context. The relevant parts here are the mention of Smith et al.'s work showing yield loss, and the statement that the current study builds on this. The key part is "builds on this," which suggests that the cited work is foundational for the current research.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. Since the current study is building upon the cited work, that points towards a foundational intent, which maps to "Basis" in the predefined classes. Alternatively, maybe "Motivation" if they're using it to justify their research. Wait, let me check the definitions again. 

Basis is when the citation is the intellectual foundation. The example given for Basis mentions replicating previous work. Here, the current study is building on the cited work, so it's using it as a basis. The phrase "builds on this" suggests that the cited study is the foundation.

Alternatively, if they were comparing their methods or results, it might be CoCoGM or CoCoRes, but the context here is about building upon, not comparing. 

Motivation would be if the cited work identified a gap or need, but here the current study is extending prior work, so Basis seems right.

Step 3: Select the specific label. The most appropriate here would be "Basis" because the current research is building upon the cited study's findings as a foundation.
