Okay, let me tackle this classification step by step. The user provided a scientific article citation passage and wants me to determine the rhetorical class of the citation marked as @@CITATION@@. 

First, I need to follow the steps outlined. Starting with Step 1: Extract the context discussing the citation. The passage given is:

"Investigations into the effects of magnetic fields on calcite scale formation have been limited to date. @@CITATION@@ reported a 40% reduction in scale deposition under a static magnetic field, but the mechanism remained unclear. To address this gap, we conducted a series of experiments..."

So the context around the citation mentions that the cited work reported a 40% reduction but didn't explain the mechanism. The current study is addressing the mechanism. 

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The cited work's result is mentioned as having a specific finding (40% reduction), but the mechanism isn't clear. The current paper is trying to address that gap. The general intent here seems to be pointing out a knowledge gap that the current study is addressing. That would fall under Motivational, specifically Motivation or Future. 

Looking at the definitions:
- Motivation is for justifying the current research by identifying a gap or need. The example given for Motivation mentions a previous study showing a result but not explaining the mechanism, which is exactly this case. The current work's purpose is to understand the mechanism, so this is a motivation for their research.

Future is about suggesting directions for future research, but here the citation is used to explain why the current study is being done now, not suggesting what should be done next. 

Step 3: Choose the specific class. Between Motivation and maybe Basis? Wait, Basis is about foundational work. The cited study here provided a result that the current study is building upon, but it's more about pointing out that the mechanism wasn't explained before, hence motivating the current work. 

So the correct label should be Motivation. Let me check the example for Motivation again: "The explanation of the phenomena is not yet offered and the purpose of this work is to try to understand the mechanism..." which matches the given example here. 

Therefore, the answer is Motivation.
