Okay, let's tackle this classification problem. The user provided a scientific article passage with a citation tagged as @@CITATION@@, and I need to determine the rhetorical class of that citation. Let me go through the steps carefully.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage given is:

"The role of mycorrhizal fungi in plant nutrient uptake has been well-documented @@CITATION@@. However, their impact on drought resistance in olive trees remains understudied compared to other crops. Our study builds on previous work @@CITATION@@ which showed that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi can enhance water use efficiency in wheat under drought conditions."

Wait, there are two citations here. The user's task specifies to focus on the citation tagged @@CITATION@@. But in the provided example, there are two citations. Hmm, maybe the second one is the target? Let me check again. The user's instruction says "the citation tagged @@CITATION@@", so perhaps the second mention is the one in question. Let me confirm the exact context. The first citation is about the role of mycorrhizal fungi in nutrient uptake, and the second is about enhancing water use efficiency in wheat. Since the task is about the citation tagged @@CITATION@@, maybe the second one is the target here. Let me proceed under that assumption.

Step 1: Extract the context discussing the citation. The relevant sentence is: "Our study builds on previous work @@CITATION@@ which showed that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi can enhance water use efficiency in wheat under drought conditions." The context here is that the current study is building upon the cited work. The citation is mentioned as the basis for their current study's foundation.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. Since the current study is building on the cited work, this seems foundational. The cited work provides the foundation for their research. The general intent would be Foundational, which maps to "Basis".

Step 3: Check the specific classes. The example for Basis says it's when the citation references the intellectual foundation. The sentence here says "builds on previous work", which aligns with Basis. 

Wait, but let me make sure. Another possibility could be Support, if the cited work supports their current findings. But the phrasing "builds on" suggests that the cited work is a foundation that their study is extending. So Basis is more appropriate here. 

Alternatively, if the cited work's results are being used to support their approach, maybe Support? But "builds on" implies that the cited work is a basis for their current study's methodology or theoretical framework. The example for Basis mentions replicating previous work, but here it's building upon it. However, Basis is still about foundational work. 

Therefore, the correct label should be Basis.
