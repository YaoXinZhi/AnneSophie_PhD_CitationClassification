Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. The user provided a scientific article passage with a citation tagged @@CITATION@@, and I need to determine the rhetorical class of that citation. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage given is: 

"Despite advances in understanding plant defense mechanisms, the role of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in signaling between infected and neighboring plants remains unclear @@CITATION@@. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of VOCs in early warning systems, but their reliability under varying environmental conditions has not been thoroughly investigated."

So the citation is attached to the statement about the role of VOCs in signaling remaining unclear. The next sentence mentions that recent studies (probably including the current paper) are looking into their potential but there's a gap in understanding reliability under different conditions.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation here is pointing out that there's a knowledge gap—since the role is "unclear" and the following sentence talks about what hasn't been thoroughly investigated. That sounds like the citation is highlighting why the current research is needed, which would fall under Motivational intent. The options under Motivational are either Motivation or Future. Since the citation is about a gap motivating the current study, it's more likely Motivation.

Step 3: Choosing the specific class. The example for Motivation is when the citation justifies the research by pointing out a knowledge gap. The example given in the context matches this exactly—the cited work shows that the role remains unclear, which motivates further research. The Future class is for suggesting future directions, but here it's more about the motivation for the current study. So the correct label should be Motivation.

Motivation
