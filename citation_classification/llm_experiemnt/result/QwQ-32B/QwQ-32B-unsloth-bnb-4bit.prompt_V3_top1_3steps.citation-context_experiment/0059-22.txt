Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user provided a task where I need to classify a citation in a scientific article into one of several predefined rhetorical classes. The example given is in the plant health domain, so I need to focus on that context.

First, I need to follow the steps outlined. The first step is to extract the context around the citation @@CITATION@@. The user hasn't provided the actual passage yet, so I might be missing some information here. Wait, actually, looking back, the user's input includes a sample passage. Wait no, in the problem statement, the user is giving an example of how to do it, but the actual test case might be provided in the query. Wait, let me check again.

Wait, the user's message is structured as a problem where they want me to act as a classifier. The example given in the problem is part of their instruction. The actual task would be presented in a query where they provide a specific passage with @@CITATION@@, and I have to process that. Since the current input is the problem setup, maybe the user is testing me with the example they provided in their own instructions? Let me re-read the user's message carefully.

Ah, the user's message ends with the output format instructions. The example they gave in their own instructions (like the Basis example) is part of their explanation. But the actual test case they want me to process might be the example under the "Support" class, or perhaps there's a hidden passage here. Wait, perhaps I need to check the exact input again. Wait, looking at the user's message again:

Wait, the user's message is the entire setup, including the problem description, task, steps, definitions, and then says "Please strictly follow this format. Do not provide any explanations..." and then the output format. Wait, but where is the actual citation passage to classify? The user might have intended to include a specific example but forgot. Wait, no, perhaps the user's actual input is the entire structure above, but the citation passage is missing here. Wait, perhaps this is an error in the problem setup. Alternatively, maybe the user is providing a test case where the citation passage is in their message but I missed it.

Wait, looking again: The user's message includes the example under "Support" like "All subscales were consistent... @@CITATION@@". But perhaps the actual test case is part of the user's message? Wait, no. Let me check again.

The user's message starts with "You are a classifier...", then the context, task, steps, definitions, and output format. The user probably expects me to process a specific citation passage that they provided in their message, but in the current input, I don't see the citation passage. Wait, perhaps the example under "Support" is part of their input, but the actual test case is the one with the @@CITATION@@ placeholder. Wait, maybe the user is asking me to process their own example? For instance, in the "Support" example: "All subscales were consistent with previous research, particularly that of @@CITATION@@ also using a U.S. sample; as before, participants did not distinguish between personal interests and values as reasons for disputes, nor between competence and methods." So here, the citation is in the context where the authors are saying their results are consistent with previous research, specifically the cited work. The task would be to classify that citation's rhetorical class. But in the user's problem, they might have included such a passage as the input.

Wait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again. The user's actual input is the entire problem setup as given, and they want me to process a specific example they provided within that setup. For example, in the "Support" example, the citation is there. So maybe the task here is to process that example and output the correct label. The user might have structured their query this way to test the classifier with their own examples. Let me look again.

Wait, the user's message ends with the output format instructions, so perhaps the actual test case they want me to process is the example under "Support" or another example they provided in their own definitions. Since the user's instruction says "before providing the final JSON output, include your step-by-step reasoning", but the user also says "do not provide any explanations...", perhaps the example given in the problem is the test case. Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake here, and the user intended to provide a specific passage with @@CITATION@@. Since I need to proceed, perhaps I should take one of their examples and work through it as a test case.

Let me pick the "Support" example they provided:

Example: “All subscales were consistent with previous research, particularly that of @@CITATION@@ also using a U.S. sample; as before, participants did not distinguish between personal interests and values as reasons for disputes, nor between competence and methods.”

The citation here is used to support the current study's findings by pointing out consistency with previous work. The general intent would be supportive, so the specific class would be "Support".

Following the steps:

Step 1: Extract the context around @@CITATION@@. The sentence is: "All subscales were consistent with previous research, particularly that of @@CITATION@@ also using a U.S. sample; as before, participants did not distinguish between personal interests and values as reasons for disputes, nor between competence and methods."

The relevant part is "consistent with previous research, particularly that of @@CITATION@@ also using a U.S. sample".

Step 2: General intent is supportive, as they are supporting their results with prior work.

Step 3: The specific class is Support, as per the example given. So the final label would be "Support".

Alternatively, if the example under "CoCoGM" was the input:

Example: “Most closely related to this paper is concurrent work by @@CITATION@@ who propose a method to ‘debias’ word embeddings. Our work is complementary, as we focus instead on rigorously demonstrating human-like biases in word embeddings.”

Here, the citation is compared in terms of goals/methods, so CoCoGM.

But since the user's problem includes all these examples but the actual task requires processing a specific citation passage with @@CITATION@@, perhaps the user expects me to process the "Support" example as the test case here. Since the user's instructions might have a formatting error, but given the way the problem is presented, I'll proceed with the Support example as the test case here. Alternatively, maybe I need to wait for the user's next input. But since this is the current query, perhaps the user intended to present that example and wants me to process it. So proceeding with that example, the answer would be Support.
