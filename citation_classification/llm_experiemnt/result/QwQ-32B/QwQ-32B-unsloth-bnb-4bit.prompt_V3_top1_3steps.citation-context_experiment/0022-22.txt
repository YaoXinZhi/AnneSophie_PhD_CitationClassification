Okay, let's tackle this classification task step by step. The user provided a scientific article passage with a citation marked as @@CITATION@@, and I need to determine the rhetorical class of that citation. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage given is:

"In a study by Smith et al. (2020), it was found that the application of magnetic fields significantly reduced bacterial growth in plant roots. However, the mechanism behind this effect remains unclear @@CITATION@@. Our current research builds on this by investigating the role of iron oxide nanoparticles in this process."

So the citation is attached to the sentence: "the mechanism behind this effect remains unclear @@CITATION@@." 

Step 1: Extract the context discussing the citation. The relevant part here is the mention that the mechanism remains unclear, which is pointed out by the cited work. The next sentence says that the current research builds on this, indicating that the cited study identified a knowledge gap that the current work is addressing.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. Since the citation points out an unclear mechanism (a knowledge gap), which motivates the current research, the general intent is Motivational. 

Now, looking at the specific rhetorical classes under Motivational: Motivation or Future. The example for Motivation is when the citation justifies the current research by pointing out a knowledge gap. Here, the cited work's finding that the mechanism is unclear is the reason the current study is conducted. The Future class is more about suggesting future directions, but here it's about the motivation for the current study. 

Therefore, the specific class should be Motivation.
