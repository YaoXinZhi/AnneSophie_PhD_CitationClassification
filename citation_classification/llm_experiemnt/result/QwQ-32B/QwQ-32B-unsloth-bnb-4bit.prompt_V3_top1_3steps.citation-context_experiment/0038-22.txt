Okay, let me tackle this step by step. First, I need to look at the given citation context. The user provided the example where the task is to classify the citation. The example given was about comparing results between studies. Let me see the exact passage again.

The example passage says: “Fast multiplication rates and high concentration of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains have been reported in young developing leaves and roots of infected daisy plants (Wei et al., 2004; Saracco et al., 2006), although conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima @@CITATION@@.”

Step 1: Extract the context. The relevant part here is that there are conflicting results between the cited works. The main point is that while some studies (Wei and Saracco) found certain results, the @@CITATION@@ presents conflicting findings.

Step 2: Determine the general intent. Since they are comparing results between different studies (the cited work and others), this falls under Comparative. Then, looking at the specific classes under Comparative, CoCoRes is for comparing results. But wait, the example given for CoCoXY is exactly this scenario where two studies are compared with each other, not with the citing paper. The example in CoCoXY mentions conflicting results between Wei et al., 2004; Saracco et al., 2006 and another study (the @@CITATION@@). So the citation here is being used to contrast two studies, not comparing with the current paper's results. Therefore, the general intent is Comparative, and the specific class is CoCoXY because it's comparing the cited work's results with another cited work, not the citing paper's own results.

Wait, the example given in CoCoXY is exactly this case. The user's example in the problem statement for CoCoXY is the same structure: conflicting results between studies. Therefore, the answer should be CoCoXY.
