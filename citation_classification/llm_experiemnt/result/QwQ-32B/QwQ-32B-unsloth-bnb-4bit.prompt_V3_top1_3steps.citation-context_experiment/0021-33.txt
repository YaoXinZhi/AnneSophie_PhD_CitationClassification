Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a citation passage and wants me to classify the citation's rhetorical class. First, I need to extract the context around the citation @@CITATION@@. The passage given is:

"In studies of plant disease resistance mechanisms, previous research has identified the role of salicylic acid in activating defense pathways @@CITATION@@. However, our findings suggest that jasmonic acid might play a more significant role in certain host-pathogen interactions, contrasting with earlier studies that focused solely on salicylic acid’s role @@CITATION@@."

Wait, there are two citations here. But the user is asking about @@CITATION@@, so maybe the second one? Wait, actually, in the example given by the user, the citation is placed in the context. Let me check again.

Wait, the user's input is the passage with @@CITATION@@, so the actual input passage here would be the one provided, but in the example given by the user, the task is to process a passage where the citation is tagged. Let me look again.

The user's actual input passage is:

"In studies of plant disease resistance mechanisms, previous research has identified the role of salicylic acid in activating defense pathways @@CITATION@@. However, our findings suggest that jasmonic acid might play a more significant role in certain host-pathogen interactions, contrasting with earlier studies that focused solely on salicylic acid’s role @@CITATION@@."

Wait, but the citation is marked as @@CITATION@@, so the first citation is the one being referred to? Or perhaps both? But the user says "the citation tagged @@CITATION@@", so maybe each occurrence is a separate citation. But in the problem, perhaps the citation in question is the second one? Because the first part says "previous research" with the first citation, then the second citation is in the contrasting part. Wait, but the user's example might have only one citation. Let me read the problem again.

Wait, the user's actual input is given in the context. Wait, no, the user's problem is presented as:

The user's input would be a passage with @@CITATION@@, and the task is to classify that citation. Let me check the user's exact input.

Wait, in the problem presented by the user, the actual passage to process is:

"In studies of plant disease resistance mechanisms, previous research has identified the role of salicylic acid in activating defense pathways @@CITATION@@. However, our findings suggest that jasmonic acid might play a more significant role in certain host-pathogen interactions, contrasting with earlier studies that focused solely on salicylic acid’s role @@CITATION@@."

Wait, but there are two @@CITATION@@ tags here. That's confusing. Wait, perhaps it's a mistake. The user might have intended one citation, but the example shows two. Hmm, perhaps it's a typo. Alternatively, maybe the citation in question is the second one. Let me parse the problem again.

Wait, the user's exact input passage is given as:

"In studies of plant disease resistance mechanisms, previous research has identified the role of salicylic acid in activating defense pathways @@CITATION@@. However, our findings suggest that jasmonic acid might play a more significant role in certain host-pathogen interactions, contrasting with earlier studies that focused solely on salicylic acid’s role @@CITATION@@."

Wait, but the task is to classify the citation @@CITATION@@. Since there are two citations here, perhaps the user made an error, but let's assume that the citation in question is the second one. Let's proceed with that.

Step 1: Extract the context discussing the citation. The citation is at the end of the sentence starting with "However, our findings...", so the context around the second @@CITATION@@ is the sentence: "However, our findings suggest that jasmonic acid might play a more significant role in certain host-pathogen interactions, contrasting with earlier studies that focused solely on salicylic acid’s role @@CITATION@@."

The key part here is "contrasting with earlier studies", which implies that the cited work (the @@CITATION@@) is being contrasted with the current study's findings. The authors are pointing out a difference between their results and the cited studies.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. Since they are contrasting their findings with the cited studies, this is a comparative intent. The general intent would fall under Comparative, which includes CoCoGM, CoCoRes, or CoCoXY.

Now, looking at the specific definitions:

CoCoRes is for comparing results or findings between the citing paper and the cited work. Here, the current paper's findings (jasmonic acid's role) are contrasting with the cited studies that focused on salicylic acid. The contrast is about the results or the focus of the previous studies. So this seems like a comparison of results.

Alternatively, CoCoGM would be if they were comparing goals or methods, but here it's about the results or the focus of the studies. The example for CoCoRes is when results differ. The sentence says "contrasting with earlier studies that focused solely on...", which is about the findings or the emphasis of the cited work versus the current one. So CoCoRes would be the specific class here.

Wait, but let's check the example for CoCoRes: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted...". In this case, the current study's results contrast with the cited studies, so CoCoRes fits.

Therefore, the rhetorical class should be CoCoRes.
