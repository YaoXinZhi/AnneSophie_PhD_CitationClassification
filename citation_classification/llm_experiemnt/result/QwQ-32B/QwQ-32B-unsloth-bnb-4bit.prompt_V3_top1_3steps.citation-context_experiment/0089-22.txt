Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user provided a scientific article passage with a citation marked as @@CITATION@@, and I need to classify the rhetorical class of that citation. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage says: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." 

Step 1: The context here is straightforward. The sentence is stating that the experimental setup they used was described in detail in the cited work. The key part here is "described in detail previously," which suggests that the current study is using the setup from the cited paper.

Step 2: Identifying the general intent. Since the sentence mentions that the setup was described in a previous work, this is likely referring to the method or experimental setup used in the current study. The general intent here would be "Technical" because they are referencing a method or tool used in their current research.

Step 3: Now, looking at the specific rhetorical classes. The example given for "Usage" is: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." That's exactly the same as the context here. The citation is pointing out that the current study used a method or setup from the cited work. Therefore, the correct label should be "Usage".
