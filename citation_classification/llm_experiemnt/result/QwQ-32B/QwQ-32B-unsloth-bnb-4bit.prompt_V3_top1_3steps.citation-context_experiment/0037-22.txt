Okay, let's tackle this classification problem. The user provided a scientific article passage with a citation tagged as @@CITATION@@, and I need to determine the rhetorical class of that citation. Let me go through the steps carefully.

First, the task is to extract the context around the citation, figure out the general intent, and then assign the most appropriate label from the list. The example given is in the plant health domain, so I should keep that in mind.

The passage provided is: 

"Plant pathogens often exhibit host specificity, but recent studies show that some can infect multiple species. For instance, Xylella fastidiosa strains isolated from olive trees in Apulia, Italy, were found to infect grapevines as well @@CITATION@@. This finding challenges previous assumptions about host specificity and highlights the need for broader surveillance strategies."

Step 1: Extract the context discussing the citation. The relevant part here is "Xylella fastidiosa strains isolated from olive trees in Apulia, Italy, were found to infect grapevines as well @@CITATION@@." The surrounding sentences mention that this finding challenges previous assumptions and highlights the need for broader surveillance. 

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation is presenting a finding that contrasts with previous assumptions. The authors are using the cited work to show that host specificity isn't as strict as once thought. The general intent here seems to be comparative because they're contrasting the cited study's results with previous assumptions. 

Looking at the comparative subclasses: CoCoRes (Comparison of Results) would be when comparing results between the cited work and the citing paper. Wait, but in this case, the citing paper is pointing out that the cited study's results differ from previous assumptions. The cited work's result (Xylella infecting grapevines too) is compared to earlier beliefs. However, the example for CoCoRes is when comparing with the citing paper's results. Hmm, maybe that's not exactly it. Let me check the definitions again.

CoCoRes is when comparing the cited work's results with the current paper's results. Here, the current paper might not have new results yet but is using the cited study to challenge previous assumptions. Alternatively, maybe the general intent is Motivational because it's highlighting the need for future strategies, but the citation itself is supporting the challenge to assumptions. 

Wait, the citation is providing a result (Xylella infecting grapevines) that leads to the conclusion that host specificity isn't as strict. So the cited work's result is being used to support the argument that previous assumptions are wrong. So maybe the intent is Support? Because the cited study supports the authors' point that host specificity is being challenged. 

Alternatively, the citation is used to show that previous assumptions are incorrect, so it's providing evidence against them, which could be a form of Support for the current paper's argument. The example for Support is when the cited work supports the current authors' findings. Here, the cited work's result supports the idea that host specificity is less strict, which the authors are using to make their point. 

Alternatively, maybe it's Motivation because it's pointing out a knowledge gap or need for broader surveillance. The last sentence says "highlights the need for broader surveillance strategies." So maybe the citation is used to motivate the need for future actions. But the citation itself is the study that found the infection in grapevines, so the citation is providing the basis for that motivation. 

Hmm. Let me think again. The citation is being cited to present a finding (the Xylella infecting grapevines) which challenges previous assumptions. The authors are using that cited result to argue for broader surveillance. The citation here is supporting their argument that previous assumptions were wrong, so the citation is providing support for their current claim. 

So the general intent would be Supportive, leading to the specific label Support. Alternatively, if the citation's result is similar to the current paper's findings, but the current paper might not have their own results here. The example for Similar is when pointing out similarity between cited and current work, but here it's more that the cited work's result supports the authors' argument. 

Wait the example for Support is: "All subscales were consistent with previous research, particularly that of @@CITATION@@...", so here the cited work supports their findings. In this case, the cited work's finding supports the argument that host specificity is not as strict, so the authors are using the citation to support their point. Therefore, the label should be Support.
