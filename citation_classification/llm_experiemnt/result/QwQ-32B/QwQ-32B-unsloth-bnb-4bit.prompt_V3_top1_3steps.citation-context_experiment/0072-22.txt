Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user provided a scientific article passage with a citation marked as @@CITATION@@, and I need to classify the rhetorical class of that citation. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage given is: 

"Phytoplasma infection can lead to yellowing and necrosis of leaves, a phenomenon observed in various plant species @@CITATION@@. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these symptoms remain poorly understood."

So the citation is attached to the first sentence about the observation of yellowing and necrosis in plants due to phytoplasma. The second sentence then states that the mechanisms are not well understood. 

Step 1: The context here is that the citation supports the statement about the observed symptoms. The first sentence is a factual statement, and the citation backs it up with prior research. 

Step 2: The general intent. Since the citation is providing evidence for the observation mentioned, the intent is supportive. Now, looking at the specific classes under supportive, there's Support and Similar. The example for Support is when the citation supports the citing authors' work. Here, the citation is used to back the statement made in the current paper, so that's Support. Similar is when pointing out similarity between the cited and current work, which isn't the case here. 

Alternatively, maybe it's Basis if it's foundational. But the example for Basis is introducing a foundation, like a method or theory. Here, it's more about supporting a factual observation. So the correct class should be Support.
