Okay, let's tackle this classification. First, I need to look at the given context around @@CITATION@@. The user hasn't provided the specific passage yet, so I'll have to wait for that. Once the passage is provided, step 1 is to extract the relevant context discussing that citation. I need to focus on the sentences immediately around the citation to understand why it's being cited.

Next, step 2 is to identify the general intent. The options are foundational, comparative, motivational, supportive, technical, critical/analytical, or descriptive. The example given for Basis is when the citation is foundational. CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY fall under comparative. Motivational includes Motivation and Future. Supportive is Support or Similar. Technical is Usage. Critical is Weakness, and Neutral is descriptive.

Then, step 3 is to pick the top three rhetorical classes. The key is to match the context's intent to the definitions. For instance, if the citation is compared in results, CoCoRes would be first. If they're pointing out a similarity in findings, Similar might be. If the citation is used to support their own results, then Support. 

But without the actual text, I can't proceed. Let me wait for the user to provide the specific passage with the citation marked as @@CITATION@@. Once that's here, I'll analyze the context, figure out the intent, and apply the definitions to choose the top three classes.
