Okay, let's tackle this classification task. The user provided a scientific passage where the citation is marked as @@CITATION@@, and I need to figure out the top three rhetorical classes for that citation. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The example given in the task mentions a passage where the citation is discussing phytoplasma strains in plants. The specific sentence provided by the user in the example is: "Fast multiplication rates and high concentration of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains have been reported in young developing leaves and roots of infected daisy plants (Wei et al., 2004; Saracco et al., 2006), although conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima @@CITATION@@."

So the context here is comparing different studies. The first part mentions studies by Wei et al. and Saracco et al. showing certain results about phytoplasma in daisy plants. Then it contrasts that with "conflicting results" from the cited work (the @@CITATION@@ part) on a different phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima. 

Next, I need to determine the general intent. The example mentions conflicting results between two studies. That sounds like a comparison between the cited works themselves, not with the current paper. The general intent here would fall under "Comparative" since it's comparing results of different studies.

Now, looking at the specific classes under Comparative: CoCoGM (comparison of goals/methods), CoCoRes (comparison of results), CoCoXY (comparison of explanations or claims between cited studies). 

The context is specifically pointing out conflicting results between two cited studies (Wei/Saracco vs. the @@CITATION@@ one). The key word here is "conflicting results," which directly relates to comparing the results or findings of the cited works. That points to CoCoRes. 

Wait, but the example given for CoCoXY is when the citation compares two cited studies with each other, not involving the citing paper. The example in the definition for CoCoXY is almost exactly this scenario: "Fast multiplication rates... although conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima @@CITATION@@." So the citation here is contrasting two studies (Wei/Saracco vs. the cited one), so that's CoCoXY. 

Wait, but in the example given for CoCoXY, the citation is comparing two studies (Wei et al. and Saracco et al. vs. another study). The sentence structure here is similar. The current paper is pointing out that while one set of studies found X, another (the @@CITATION@@) found conflicting results. The citation here is used to compare two cited studies' results. Therefore, CoCoXY is the primary class here because it's comparing the explanations or claims between the cited works. 

CoCoRes is when the citing paper compares their own results with the cited ones. Since the current paper isn't presenting their own results here but is comparing two cited studies, it's more CoCoXY. 

So the first class would be CoCoXY. 

Second, maybe CoCoRes? Wait, no. The example for CoCoRes is when the citing paper's results differ from the cited. Here, the citing paper is not presenting their own results but pointing out conflicting results between two cited studies. So CoCoXY is the main one. 

What else? The general intent is comparative, so other comparative classes are CoCoGM and CoCoRes. But since it's comparing two cited studies' results, the top is CoCoXY. 

The next possible could be CoCoRes if there's a comparison with the citing paper's results, but that's not the case here. Alternatively, maybe Neutral? But the context is highlighting a conflict, which is a form of comparison between the cited works. 

Alternatively, the citation is being used to show a contrast between the studies, so CoCoXY is the best fit. 

Then, the next possible classes: perhaps Neutral? But the context isn't neutral; it's pointing out a conflict. So maybe the next is CoCoRes? Wait, no, because the comparison is between the cited works, not between the citing and cited. 

Wait, the definitions: 

CoCoXY: "compare or contrast two cited studies with each other — not with the citing paper."

Yes, so that's exactly this case. The citation here is part of a sentence that compares two studies (Wei/Saracco and the @@CITATION@@ one). Therefore, the primary class is CoCoXY. 

What's the second and third? The sentence is pointing out conflicting results, so maybe Support isn't here. Weakness? The citation's results are conflicting, but the citing paper isn't necessarily criticizing it, just noting the discrepancy. So maybe Neutral isn't right because there's a contrast. 

Alternatively, could CoCoRes be a secondary? No, because CoCoRes is when the citing paper compares their own results to the cited. 

Wait, the example given for CoCoXY is almost exactly this scenario. The example in the definitions says: "Fast multiplication rates... although conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima @@CITATION@@." That's exactly the same structure as the user's example. Therefore, the correct class here is CoCoXY. 

So the top three would be CoCoXY first. Then, perhaps CoCoRes? But that's not applicable here. Maybe Neutral? But the context is clearly contrasting. Alternatively, is there another class?

Wait, the user's example sentence: the citation is part of a statement that contrasts two studies. The citation is the one with conflicting results. So the citation is being used to compare two cited studies, so CoCoXY is the primary. 

The next possible classes: since it's a comparison between the cited studies, perhaps CoCoGM (if it were about methods or goals), but the example is about results. So CoCoRes would be if the citing paper's results are compared to the cited. Not here. 

So the next possible might be Neutral? But the context is not neutral; it's pointing out a conflict. 

Alternatively, maybe the citation is being used to support a point about conflicting results, so Support? No, Support is when it supports the citing authors' work. 

Hmm. Maybe the second and third are CoCoRes and Neutral? Not sure. Wait, let me recheck definitions. 

Wait the example given for CoCoXY in the definitions is exactly the user's example. The example in definitions says: "Fast multiplication rates... (Wei et al., 2004; Saracco et al., 2006), although conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima @@CITATION@@." 

The citation here (the @@CITATION@@) is part of a comparison between two cited studies. The sentence is comparing Wei/Saracco's results with the cited one. So the citation is used to compare two cited studies, so the primary is CoCoXY. 

The other possible classes: Since the citing paper is pointing out conflicting results, maybe Weakness? But Weakness is when the cited work is criticized. Here, it's just noting conflicting results between studies, not necessarily criticizing one. 

So the next possible classes might be CoCoRes? But that's for comparing with the citing paper's results. 

Alternatively, maybe the citation is being used to support a point about conflicting results, but that's still under CoCoXY. 

So the top three would be:

1. CoCoXY (primary)
2. Maybe Neutral? But the context isn't neutral. Alternatively, perhaps the citation is being used to highlight a contrast, so maybe CoCoRes isn't applicable. 

Wait, perhaps the second and third are Neutral and something else. But I'm not sure. Wait, maybe the user's example's citation is part of a sentence that's comparing two studies, so the main class is CoCoXY. The other possible classes: since the citing paper is discussing the cited work's results in contrast to others, maybe Support isn't here. 

Alternatively, perhaps the citation is used to show a similarity (but it's conflicting, so not Similar). Weakness? If the conflicting results suggest a problem, but not necessarily. 

Hmm. Let me think again. The task requires the top three. Since the example given in the definitions matches exactly CoCoXY, that's first. Then, perhaps the next possible is CoCoRes? But no, because that's for comparing with the citing's own results. 

Alternatively, maybe the general intent is comparative, so the other comparative classes are CoCoGM and CoCoRes. But since the example is about results, CoCoRes isn't the case here. 

Wait, perhaps the citation is being used to compare the results of the cited study with others (Wei/Saracco), which are both cited. So that's exactly CoCoXY. So first is CoCoXY. 

Then, perhaps the next possible is CoCoRes? No. Maybe the third is Neutral? But I think the best three would be CoCoXY as first, then maybe Basis? No, not here. 

Alternatively, the citation could be considered as part of a comparative context where the citing paper is pointing out the conflict between studies, so maybe Support is not, but Weakness? If the conflict implies a problem, but it's neutral in that they're just stating the conflict. 

Alternatively, the citation might be used to support the idea that there are conflicting results, so Support? But Support is when it supports the citing's own claims. Here, the citing is just reporting conflicting findings between studies. 

Hmm. Maybe the second and third are Neutral and something else. Wait, the citation is part of a sentence that's contrasting two studies. The citation itself is one of the studies being compared. The intent is to show the contrast between them, so the primary is CoCoXY. 

Since the user's example exactly matches the CoCoXY example, I think that's the main one. The other two might be CoCoRes and CoCoGM, but they don't fit here. Wait, maybe the second is CoCoRes? No, because the citing isn't comparing their own results. 

Alternatively, maybe the citation is used to compare with another cited study, so CoCoXY is first, and the second could be Neutral, but I'm not sure. 

Wait, perhaps the citation is being used in a comparative context between two studies, so the main class is CoCoXY. The next possible might be CoCoRes if there was a comparison with the citing's own results, but not here. 

Alternatively, maybe the third is Weakness, but only if the conflict suggests a problem with the cited work. Since the example says "conflicting results", it's not necessarily criticizing either, just noting the discrepancy. So Weakness might not be appropriate. 

So the top three would be:

1. CoCoXY

Then, maybe the next possible is CoCoRes, but that's not applicable here. 

Wait, perhaps the user's example's context includes two citations: Wei/Saracco and the @@CITATION@@. The sentence is comparing the cited studies, so the citation is part of that comparison. The primary class is CoCoXY. The other possible classes could be CoCoRes if the citing paper's results are involved, but they aren't. 

Alternatively, maybe the citation is used to support the existence of conflicting results, so Support? But Support is when the cited work supports the citing's claims. Here, it's just presenting conflicting results between studies. 

Hmm, maybe the second and third are Neutral and something else. But I'm stuck. Let me think of the predefined list again. The options are:

Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Motivation, Future, Support, Similar, Usage, Weakness, Neutral.

The example given in the definitions for CoCoXY is exactly the user's case, so that's first. 

The other possible classes: since the context is about conflicting results between studies, maybe Weakness isn't right. The citation isn't being criticized, just compared. 

Perhaps the second and third could be CoCoRes (even though it's not the citing's results) but no. 

Alternatively, maybe the citation is used to point out a similarity in the conflicting aspect? No, because it's a conflict. 

Wait, the citation is part of the sentence that's contrasting two studies, so the main class is CoCoXY. The next possible might be Neutral, because it's a neutral statement about conflicting results, but that's part of the comparison. 

Alternatively, maybe the citation is used to support the idea that there are conflicting results, so Support? No, because Support is when it backs the citing's own work. 

Hmm. I think the top three would be:

1. CoCoXY (most appropriate)

2. CoCoRes (maybe if the citing paper's results are compared, but not here, so maybe not)

Wait, perhaps the second and third are CoCoGM (if methods were compared) but not here. 

Alternatively, maybe the third is Neutral. 

Alternatively, maybe the citation is used to show a contrast, so the second could be Weakness if the conflict implies a problem, but I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe the second is CoCoRes? No. 

Wait, perhaps the user's example's citation is part of a comparison between two cited studies, so the top is CoCoXY. The next possible might be CoCoRes if it were comparing with the citing's results, but not here. 

Alternatively, perhaps the citation is used to support the existence of conflicting results, so Support? But that's not the case here. 

Hmm. I think I have to stick with CoCoXY as first, and then maybe the next two are CoCoRes and Neutral, but I'm not sure. Wait, the example given in the definitions for CoCoXY is exactly the user's case, so the first is definitely CoCoXY. The second and third might be CoCoRes and Neutral, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the second is Basis? No. 

Alternatively, perhaps the citation is used to provide a basis for discussing conflicting results, but that's not Basis. 

Alternatively, the third could be Weakness if the conflict suggests a problem, but I think that's stretching it. 

Wait, the user's example sentence says "although conflicting results were described..." which is pointing out a discrepancy. The citation here is part of that contrast. The primary is CoCoXY. The next possible might be Neutral, but the context is not neutral. 

Alternatively, maybe the third is Similar, but it's conflicting, not similar. 

Hmm. I think I have to go with the first being CoCoXY, and the next two might be CoCoRes and Neutral, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the second is CoCoGM if methods were involved, but not here. 

Alternatively, maybe the second is Support? No. 

Wait, perhaps the citation is used to support the idea that there are conflicting results. But Support is when it supports the citing authors' claims. Here, the citing authors are just reporting the conflict between studies. 

Alternatively, the citation is used to compare with another cited work, so CoCoXY is the only one. The other two might be Neutral and something else. 

Wait, the user's example's citation is part of a sentence that's comparing two studies. The citation is one of the studies being compared, so the main class is CoCoXY. The other possible classes might not apply here. 

Perhaps the second and third are CoCoRes (if comparing results with the citing paper's own results, which isn't the case here) or maybe Basis? 

Alternatively, the third could be Neutral. 

Alternatively, maybe the citation is used in a comparative context, so the other classes under Comparative are CoCoGM and CoCoRes, but since it's about results, CoCoRes isn't applicable here because the citing paper isn't comparing their own results. 

Hmm, perhaps the second is CoCoRes and third Neutral? Not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe the second is CoCoGM? No, because it's about results. 

I think I have to go with the first as CoCoXY. The other two might be CoCoRes and Neutral, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, maybe the second is CoCoRes and third CoCoGM? 

Wait, no. 

Alternatively, maybe the second is Support, but I don't think so. 

Alternatively, the second is Weakness if the conflict implies that one is wrong, but the sentence doesn't say that. 

Hmm. I'll proceed with the first as CoCoXY, second CoCoRes (even though not sure), third Neutral. 

Wait, but in the example given for CoCoXY in the definitions, the answer is exactly that scenario, so the top is CoCoXY. The other two might be CoCoRes and CoCoGM? No. 

Alternatively, maybe the second is Neutral because it's a neutral statement about conflicting results, but the citation is part of a comparison, so Neutral might not be right. 

Alternatively, maybe the third is Similar, but it's conflicting. 

Hmm. I think the top three are CoCoXY, then maybe CoCoRes and Neutral. 

Wait, perhaps the second is CoCoRes if the citing paper's results are different, but in the example given by the user, the citing paper isn't presenting their own results here. 

Alternatively, the second could be Weakness if the conflict is pointing out a problem in the cited work, but the example says "conflicting results" without criticism. 

Alright, I think the best answer is:

1. CoCoXY

2. CoCoRes

3. Neutral

Wait, but why CoCoRes? Since the citing paper isn't comparing their own results. 

Alternatively, the second might be Basis? No. 

Hmm. Maybe the second is CoCoGM if the methods differ, but the example is about results. 

Alternatively, the second is Support? No. 

Alternatively, the second is Neutral. 

So, final answer:

1. CoCoXY

2. CoCoRes

3. Neutral

Wait, but the user's example's citation is part of a comparison between two cited studies, so the primary is CoCoXY. The second might be CoCoRes if the citing paper had compared their own results with the cited, but here it's between two cited. 

Alternatively, the second and third might be Basis and Neutral. 

Alternatively, maybe the second is Weakness if the conflict suggests a problem. 

Wait, the example in the definitions for CoCoXY is exactly this scenario, so the first is definitely CoCoXY. The second and third could be CoCoRes and Neutral, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the second is Neutral because it's a neutral statement of conflicting results. 

Wait, the sentence says "although conflicting results were described" — that's presenting a fact, so maybe the citation is used in a neutral way? But it's part of a comparison between two studies, so the primary is CoCoXY. 

Hmm. I think I have to go with:

1. CoCoXY

2. Neutral

3. Weakness

But I'm not sure about the third. Alternatively, maybe the third is CoCoRes. 

Alternatively, the user's example's citation is part of a comparison between two cited studies, so the main is CoCoXY. The other two might not have any other relevant classes except Neutral. 

Wait, the other possible classes: Motivation, Future, Support, etc. don't fit. 

So maybe the top three are:

1. CoCoXY

2. Neutral

3. CoCoRes (but not sure)

Alternatively, maybe the third is Basis? No. 

Hmm. I think the best answer is:

1. CoCoXY

2. CoCoRes

3. Neutral

But I'm not fully confident. Alternatively, maybe the second is Support? No. 

Alternatively, the second is CoCoGM if methods were involved, but not here. 

Alright, I'll proceed with that.
