Okay, let me tackle this step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the citation marked @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. Wait, but the user hasn't provided the actual passage here. Hmm, maybe I missed that? Oh, looking back, the user's input only gives the task and the definitions. Oh wait, the user might have forgotten to include the specific passage. Oh, but in the problem statement, maybe the example given in the context is part of it? Let me check again.

Wait, the user provided an example in the definitions. For instance, under "CoCoXY", there's an example where two studies are compared. The citation there is @@CITATION@@. Wait, maybe the task here is using that example as the input? Because in the user's problem, the citation is marked @@CITATION@@, but they didn't provide the actual passage. Wait, maybe I need to look at the example given in the CoCoXY definition as the example to work with. Because otherwise, without the actual passage, I can't proceed. Let me re-read the user's query.

The user says: "Below are the fined-grained rhetorical class definitions and examples." So in the example for CoCoXY, the citation is @@CITATION@@. Maybe the task here is to process that example's citation? Because otherwise, without a specific passage provided by the user, I can't extract the context. Since the user's problem includes an example with @@CITATION@@, perhaps that's the test case here. Let me check the example again.

Looking at the CoCoXY example: "Fast multiplication rates and high concentration of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains have been reported in young developing leaves and roots of infected daisy plants (Wei et al., 2004; Saracco et al., 2006), although conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima @@CITATION@@."

So in this example, the citation is used to compare two studies (Wei et al. and Saracco et al. vs. the one in @@CITATION@@). The sentence points out conflicting results between the cited studies. Therefore, the citation here is part of a comparison between two or more cited works, not with the citing paper. That fits the CoCoXY definition. The general intent here would be comparative, specifically CoCoXY. 

Next, the other possible classes. Since it's a comparison between the cited works themselves, the primary class is CoCoXY. The other possible classes might be Neutral if it's just stating facts, but since there's a contrast (conflicting results), it's more about comparison. Support or Weakness? No, because it's not supporting the current paper's findings but contrasting two cited studies. So the top three would be CoCoXY first. Then maybe Neutral as a secondary? Or is there another? Let me see the definitions again. The example says "conflicting results were described", so the citation is pointing out a contrast between the studies, so CoCoXY is the main. The other possibilities could be CoCoRes (comparison of results), but CoCoXY is more about explanations or claims. Since conflicting results are part of their explanations or findings, CoCoXY is better. Alternatively, if it's just comparing results, then CoCoRes. Hmm.

Wait the example given for CoCoRes is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets...". Here, the citing paper compares their results with another's. But in the CoCoXY example, the citation is comparing two other studies. So in the user's example for CoCoXY, the citation is used to compare two cited studies, so that's exactly CoCoXY. Therefore, the top class is CoCoXY. Then, maybe Neutral is second? Or is there another? Let's see. The sentence is pointing out a conflict between two cited studies, so the intent is comparative between the cited works, so CoCoXY is first. The other possible classes: since it's stating that there are conflicting results, maybe Weakness? But the citation isn't being criticized; it's just noting a discrepancy between studies. So Weakness is when pointing out flaws in a cited work, but here it's just contrasting their findings. So Weakness might not apply. So the next possible could be CoCoRes, but since the comparison is between the cited works, not between the citing paper's results and others, CoCoRes would be if the citing paper's results are compared. So in this case, the correct primary is CoCoXY. The other possible classes might be Neutral as a second, but the example is clearly a comparison between studies, so maybe the second is CoCoRes? Wait, no, because the citing paper isn't comparing their own results here. The example is about two other studies. So the only applicable is CoCoXY. The next possible might be Neutral if it's just descriptive, but the key is the conflicting results, so it's a comparison between the cited studies. Therefore, the top three would be:

1. CoCoXY

Then, perhaps Neutral as second, but since the comparison is explicit, maybe there's another. Wait, the definitions for CoCoXY specify that it's comparing two cited studies, not with the citing paper. So that's exactly the case here. So the other options are less likely. The third might be CoCoRes if the focus was on results, but since the example mentions conflicting results, maybe CoCoRes is a contender. Wait, the example says "conflicting results were described for...", so the citation is pointing out a discrepancy in results between the two studies. So comparing their results, so CoCoRes would be if the citing paper's results are compared, but here it's between the two cited. Wait, the definition for CoCoRes says "directly compare or contrast the results or findings of the cited work with those of the citing paper." So in the example given for CoCoXY, since the citing paper is just discussing two cited works' conflicting results, then that's CoCoXY. So the correct class is CoCoXY. The other possible classes? Maybe Similar if they were similar, but here it's conflicting, so not. The third might be Neutral, but since it's a comparison, the top is CoCoXY. The other two could be CoCoRes (if the comparison is of results between cited works, but according to the definition, CoCoXY is for comparing cited studies with each other. So the correct order would be 1. CoCoXY, then maybe Neutral as second if there's no other, but perhaps the example's context might also have a different angle. Alternatively, maybe the citation is used to compare two studies, so CoCoXY is first, and perhaps the second is CoCoRes because it's about their results, but according to the definitions, CoCoRes is when comparing with the citing paper's results. Therefore, the top three would be:

1. CoCoXY

2. Neutral (if there's no other), but maybe there's another. Wait, the example sentence is: "Fast multiplication rates... although conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima @@CITATION@@." Here, the citation is pointing out conflicting results between the two studies (Wei and Saracco vs. the cited study in @@CITATION@@). So the main intent is to compare the cited works, so CoCoXY. The other possible classes? Since it's a comparison, maybe CoCoGM if it's about methods or goals, but here it's about results. So the next is CoCoRes? But according to the definitions, CoCoRes is between the citing paper's results and another. Since this is between two cited papers, it's CoCoXY. So the top three would be CoCoXY first, then perhaps Neutral as second, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the example is a direct case of CoCoXY and that's the only one. The third might be... maybe Basis? No. Or Support? No. Hmm. The user's instruction says to pick top three. Since only CoCoXY fits perfectly, the next could be Neutral because it's a factual statement, but the primary is CoCoXY. Alternatively, maybe the example is exactly CoCoXY, so the other two are less likely. The user's example given for CoCoXY is the exact case here. So perhaps the answer is:

1. CoCoXY

2. CoCoRes (if considering that the comparison is about results between the cited studies, even though the definition says CoCoRes is between citing and cited), but maybe the user's example is in the CoCoXY context. Alternatively, perhaps the second is CoCoGM if the methods differ, but the example mentions results. Hmm. Maybe the second is Neutral, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, the third could be something else. Wait, the user's example for CoCoXY is exactly this scenario, so the top is CoCoXY. The next two might be CoCoRes (if the comparison is of results between the cited papers, even though the definition says CoCoRes is between citing and cited. So perhaps the user intended CoCoXY here. Thus, the top three would be CoCoXY as 1, and the other two might be Neutral and something else. Wait, maybe there's no other applicable classes. The user requires three, so perhaps:

1. CoCoXY

2. CoCoRes (even if it's a stretch), but no, because the citing paper isn't comparing its own results. Alternatively, maybe the second is Weakness? No, because it's not criticizing. So perhaps the second is Neutral and third something else, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the user might expect that in the example given for CoCoXY, the citation is @@CITATION@@, so the correct answer is:

1. CoCoXY

2. CoCoRes (if the comparison is of results between cited works, even though the definition says CoCoRes is between citing and cited. But maybe the user's example is considered CoCoXY. So perhaps the second and third are less relevant, but the user requires three. Maybe the third is Support or something else. Alternatively, maybe the user's example's citation is used to compare two cited studies, so only CoCoXY is primary, and the others are less. Maybe the second is Neutral, and third something else. But I need to pick three. Let me check the definitions again:

CoCoXY is for comparing two cited studies. The example given in the problem for CoCoXY is exactly this scenario. So the top is CoCoXY. The next possible might be CoCoRes if the comparison is about their results, but since the definition says CoCoRes is between citing and cited, perhaps the second is Neutral. Third, maybe Basis? Not really. Or Usage? No. So maybe:

1. CoCoXY

2. CoCoRes (even though it's not exactly the case)

3. Neutral

Alternatively, perhaps the user expects CoCoRes here because it's about conflicting results between studies. Maybe the definition of CoCoXY includes comparisons of explanations or claims, which includes results. So CoCoXY is the best. The other two could be Neutral and something else. But I'm not sure. Since the user's example is in the CoCoXY's definition, I think the answer is:

1. CoCoXY

2. CoCoRes (if the comparison is of results between cited works, even though the definition says CoCoRes is between citing and cited. Maybe the user considers this as CoCoXY includes that.)

Wait, no. The example given in CoCoRes is between the citing paper and another. The CoCoXY example is between two cited papers, so that's the key difference. So the answer should be CoCoXY as first. The other two might be Neutral and perhaps something else. Alternatively, maybe the second is Weakness if the conflicting results imply a problem, but not necessarily. Hmm. Alternatively, the user's example's citation is pointing out conflicting results between the two studies, so that's a comparison between the cited works, so CoCoXY is the only applicable. The other two might be less relevant, but the user requires three. Maybe the second is CoCoGM if the methods are compared, but the example doesn't mention methods. Third, Neutral. So the final answer would be:

1. CoCoXY

2. Neutral

3. CoCoRes (maybe not, but need to pick three)

Alternatively, perhaps the third is Support? No. Maybe the example is exactly CoCoXY, so the other two are less applicable, but have to pick three. Maybe the third is Basis? No. Hmm. Alternatively, the user might have intended CoCoRes here, but according to the definitions, it's CoCoXY. So I'll go with:

1. CoCoXY

2. CoCoRes (even though the definition says it's between citing and cited, but maybe the user's example is considered CoCoRes?)

Wait, the example in CoCoRes says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." Here, the citing paper's results are compared with the cited's. In the CoCoXY example, the citing paper is comparing two cited studies. So the example given in the problem for CoCoXY is exactly the case here, so the top is CoCoXY. The other two might be Neutral and something else, but I can't think of another. Maybe the second is Neutral and third Basis? No. Alternatively, maybe the user expects CoCoRes as second, even if it's a stretch. I'll proceed with that.
