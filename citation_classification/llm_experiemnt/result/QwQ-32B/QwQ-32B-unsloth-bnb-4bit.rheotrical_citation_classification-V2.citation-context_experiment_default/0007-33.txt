Okay, let's tackle this citation classification problem. The user provided a scientific article passage with a citation placeholder (CITSEG) and wants to classify it into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. 

First, I need to read through the example passage carefully. The example given is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)."

Hmm, the key here is to determine the rhetorical role of the citation. The sentence starts by saying that the current results are different from those in the cited work. The phrase "substantially differ from the results" is crucial here. 

Looking at the classes again to see which one fits. Let's go through them:

- **Basis**: If the cited work is foundational or a continuation. But here it's contrasting results, not building upon them. Doesn't fit.
- **CoCoGM**: Comparison of goals or methods. The example is about results, not goals or methods. 
- **CoCoRes**: Direct comparison of results. The example says "differ from the results", which matches this definition exactly. 
- **CoCoXY**: Comparing two cited studies with each other. But here the citing paper is comparing its own results with the cited one, not two cited studies. 
- **Future**: Not about suggesting future research. 
- **Motivation**: Doesn't seem to be motivating the current research by a gap. 
- **Neutral**: The citation is being used to contrast, which isn't neutral. 
- **Similar**: Points out similarity, but here it's difference. 
- **Support**: The cited work's results are conflicting, not supporting. 
- **Usage**: Not a method/tool used here. 
- **Weakness**: The citation isn't being criticized for flaws, just their results are different. 

So, the best fit here is **CoCoRes** because it's a direct comparison of results between the current work and the cited study. The key words "substantially differ from the results" align perfectly with the CoCoRes definition.
