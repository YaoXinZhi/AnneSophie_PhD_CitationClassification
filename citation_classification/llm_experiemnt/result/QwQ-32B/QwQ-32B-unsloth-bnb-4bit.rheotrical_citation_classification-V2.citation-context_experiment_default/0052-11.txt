Okay, I need to determine the correct rhetorical class for the citation in the given example. Let me start by reading the example passage again carefully. The example given is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)." 

The task is to assign one of the predefined classes like Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, etc. Let me recall the definitions. CoCoRes is for when the citation is used to compare or contrast the results or findings of the cited work with the citing paper's. The example provided under CoCoRes is exactly this scenario: the current results are compared directly with the cited study's results. 

Looking at the sentence, it clearly states that the current results "substantially differ from the results" of the cited experiments. The key words here are "differ from the results," which strongly points towards a comparison of the outcomes between the two studies. 

I should check other classes to make sure there's no better fit. CoCoXY is for comparing two cited studies, but here it's comparing the current work with the cited one, so that's not it. Support would be if the citation aligned with the current findings, but here it's contrasting. Weakness is about criticizing the cited work's flaws, but the example doesn't mention flaws, just different results. Therefore, CoCoRes seems correct.
