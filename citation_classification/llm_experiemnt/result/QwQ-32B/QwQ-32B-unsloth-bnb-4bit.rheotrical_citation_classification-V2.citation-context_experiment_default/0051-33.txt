Okay, let me tackle this classification task. The user provided a passage where a citation is mentioned as (CITSEG), and I need to figure out which rhetorical class it belongs to from the list given.

First, I need to understand the context of the citation in the passage. The example given is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)."

Looking at the sentence structure, the key part here is that the current study's results are being compared directly with the cited work's results. The phrase "substantially differ from the results" clearly indicates a direct comparison of the outcomes between the two studies. 

Now, I'll check the list of rhetorical classes again to ensure I'm matching this correctly. The CoCoRes class is for when the citation is used to compare or contrast the results or findings with the citing paper. That's exactly what's happening here. The authors are pointing out a difference in their results compared to the cited work, which falls under CoCoRes. 

Let me double-check other possible classes to be safe. CoCoGM is about methods or goals, but this is about results. Support would be if they agreed, but they're contrasting. Weakness is about pointing out flaws, which isn't the case here. So yes, CoCoRes is the correct class.
