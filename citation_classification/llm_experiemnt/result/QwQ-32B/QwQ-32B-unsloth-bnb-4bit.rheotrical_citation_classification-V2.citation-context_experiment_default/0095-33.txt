Okay, let's tackle this classification task step by step. First, I need to understand the citation passage provided. The user's example here is crucial. The passage says: "The experimental set-up was described in details previously (CITSEG)." 

Now, looking at the rhetorical classes, I need to figure out which one fits best. The key here is what role the citation (CITSEG) is playing in this sentence. The sentence states that the experimental setup was described before in the cited work. That sounds like the current study is using the methods or setup from the cited paper. 

Checking the classes, the 'Usage' class is for when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup used in the current study. The example given for Usage is almost identical: "The experimental set-up was described in details previously (CITSEG)." Which matches exactly with the user's example. 

So, this should be straightforward. The citation here is pointing out that the experimental setup used in the current study was described in a previous work, which fits the 'Usage' category perfectly. Other classes like 'Support' might involve using the citation to back up a claim, but here it's more about the method being utilized, not supporting a finding. 'Basis' is about foundational work, but if the setup is just used here, then 'Usage' is better. 

Double-checking other options: 'Neutral' is for descriptive mentions without argumentation, but in this context, they're specifically referencing their own method's prior description, so 'Usage' still fits. No comparison or contrast is happening here, so 'CoCoGM' or 'CoCoRes' aren't right. 'Motivation' is about justifying the research, which isn't the case here. The citation is purely about a method used, so the label is Usage.
