Okay, let's tackle this classification. The user wants me to determine the rhetorical class of a citation in a plant health context. The example given is: "The experimental set-up was described in details previously (CITSEG)." 

First, I'll go through each of the classes to see which fits best. 

Starting with "Usage": The example here is about using a method, tool, dataset, or setup from the cited work. The sentence says the setup was described before, which implies they're referring to a prior description of their own setup. That sounds like they're using the cited work's experimental setup here. 

Checking other classes to be sure. "Support" would be if they're using the citation to back up a claim, but here it's more about the method being described elsewhere. "Basis" is about foundational work, but the sentence is just referencing where the setup was first detailed. "Neutral" is descriptive but not argumentative. Since they're pointing out that the setup was previously described, it's a direct reference to prior work for the methodology, which fits "Usage". 

No other classes like "Similar" or "CoCo" since there's no comparison. "Future" and "Motivation" don't apply here. "Weakness" is for criticism, which isn't present. So "Usage" is the right category here.
