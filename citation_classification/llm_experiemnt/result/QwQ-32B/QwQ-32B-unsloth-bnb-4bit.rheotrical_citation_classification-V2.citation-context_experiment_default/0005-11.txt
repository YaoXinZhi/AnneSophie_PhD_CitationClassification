Okay, let's tackle this citation classification task. The user gave an example about plant health, but the actual example here is a general one. The task is to determine the rhetorical class of the citation (CITSEG) in the provided passage.

First, I need to recall the different classes. Let me list them again to make sure I remember:

- **Basis**: The cited work is the foundation of the current research. Like when they're building on previous work directly.
- **CoCoGM**: Comparing goals or methods between the cited work and the current paper.
- **CoCoRes**: Comparing results between the two papers.
- **CoCoXY**: Comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies (not involving the current paper).
- **Future**: Suggesting future research directions using the citation.
- **Motivation**: Justifying why the current research is done, maybe pointing out a gap.
- **Neutral**: Just mentioning without any argumentative role.
- **Similar**: Pointing out similarities in results, methods, etc., between cited and current work.
- **Support**: Using the citation to back up their own claims.
- **Usage**: Mentioning a method/tool from the cited work used in the current study.
- **Weakness**: Criticizing the cited work's limitations.

Now, the example given is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)."

Looking at this, the key phrase here is "substantially differ from the results". The citing authors are directly comparing their results with those of the cited work. The comparison is about the results themselves, not the methods or goals. So this should be **CoCoRes**.

Wait, let me check the classes again. The CoCoRes example given is exactly this scenario: comparing results. Yes, so the correct class here is CoCoRes. The other options like CoCoGM would be if they compared methods or goals. Since it's specifically about results differing, that's CoCoRes. The citation is used to contrast their findings, so that's a direct comparison of results. So the answer should be CoCoRes.
