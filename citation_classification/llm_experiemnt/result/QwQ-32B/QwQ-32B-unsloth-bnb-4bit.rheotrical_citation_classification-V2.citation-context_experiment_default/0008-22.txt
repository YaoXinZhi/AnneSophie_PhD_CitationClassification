Okay, I need to figure out the right rhetorical class for this citation segment. Let me start by reading the example given.

The example says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)." 

Hmm, the key here is that the citing paper is directly comparing their results with those of the cited work. The passage states that their results "substantially differ" from the cited experiments. That immediately makes me think of the CoCoRes class, which is for comparing results. 

Let me check the definitions again. CoCoRes is when the citation compares or contrasts results or findings with the cited work. The example provided under CoCoRes matches exactly with this scenario. The other classes don't seem to fit. For instance, CoCoGM is about methods or goals, which isn't the case here. Support would be if they agreed, but here they're contrasting. Weakness is about criticizing the cited work's flaws, but the example is about differing results, not pointing out a problem with the cited study's quality. So CoCoRes is the right choice here.
