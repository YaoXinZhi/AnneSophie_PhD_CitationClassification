Okay, I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in the given example. Let me read the example again: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)." 

The key part here is that they're saying their current results "substantially differ from" the cited work's results. That sounds like a direct comparison of the outcomes between the two studies. 

Looking at the classes, CoCoRes is for comparing results. The example provided under CoCoRes is similar: "The results obtained in the present work... differ from... (CITSEG)". Wait, actually, that example is exactly the one given here. So that must be the right one.

Let me check the other options to be sure. CoCoGM is about goals or methods, but this is about results. Support would be if they agreed, but here they're contrasting. Weakness is criticizing, but it's a comparison, not pointing out flaws. So yes, CoCoRes fits best.
