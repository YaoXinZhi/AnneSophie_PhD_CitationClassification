Okay, I need to classify the citation in the given passage. Let me start by reading the example provided. The user's task is to assign one of the predefined rhetorical classes to the citation marked as (CITSEG). 

The example given under 'Support' says, "All subscales were consistent with previous research, particularly that of (CITSEG) also using a U.S. sample; as before, participants did not distinguish between personal interests and values as reasons for disputes, nor between competence and methods." Here, the citation is used to support the current findings by aligning with previous research.

Looking at the passage provided by the user: "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not (CITSEG)."

The sentence structure here is similar to the Support example. The authors state that their finding is supported by other investigations, and the citation (CITSEG) is mentioned right after that. The phrase "is supported by" directly links the cited work as providing supporting evidence for their own results. The cited work's findings about fleas and ticks align with their own findings about insect hosts influencing bacterial communities. 

Now, I need to cross-check with other possible classes. Is it Similar? The 'Similar' example mentions pointing out similarity in results. The current passage does indicate a similar pattern (host influence), but the key phrase here is "is supported by," which is more about confirmation than just noting similarity. 

Could it be CoCoRes? That's for comparing results directly. Here, they are not contrasting but supporting. The citation is presented as additional evidence, not comparing results. 

Basis? The citation isn't the foundation of their research but rather supporting their specific finding. 

Motivation? It's not explaining why the research was done but rather backing up the result. 

So the best fit is Support because they're using the cited work to back up their own findings.
