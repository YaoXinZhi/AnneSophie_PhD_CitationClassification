Okay, I need to classify the rhetorical class of the citation in the given passage. Let me start by reading the example provided. The task is to figure out what role the citation (CITSEG) plays in the context of the citing text. The user has listed several classes like Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, etc. Each has its own description and example.

The example given here is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)." 

Hmm, so the key here is to see how the citation is used here. The sentence is comparing the current results with the cited work's results. The phrase "substantially differ from the results of the experiments" indicates a direct comparison between the results of the present study and those in the cited work. 

Looking at the classes, CoCoRes is for when the citation is used to compare or contrast results or findings between the cited and the current paper. That seems to fit here because they are talking about differing results. 

Let me check other possible classes. Basis is when the cited work is the foundation, which doesn't apply here. CoCoGM is about goals or methods, but the example is about results. CoCoXY compares explanations or claims between two cited studies, but here it's the current work vs the cited one. Support would be if the citation supports the current results, but here they differ. Weakness is about criticizing the cited work. But the passage is just stating a difference, not pointing out flaws. So CoCoRes is the best fit here. I think that's right.
