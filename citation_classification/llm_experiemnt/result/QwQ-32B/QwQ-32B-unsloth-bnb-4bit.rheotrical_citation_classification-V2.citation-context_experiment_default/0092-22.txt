Okay, let me start by understanding the task. I need to classify the rhetorical class of a citation in a scientific article's passage. The user provided a list of classes like Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, etc., each with examples. The key is to figure out which class fits the given citation example best.

The current example is: "Similarly, a small aphid gut binding peptide was shown to interfere with enamovirus uptake from pea aphid gut into the hemocoel; the peptide also bound to gut epithelia of two other aphid species suggesting potential broader applicability (CITSEG)."

First, I'll look for keywords in the sentence. The phrase "suggesting potential broader applicability" seems important. The citation is presenting a previous finding that this peptide works in other species too. The main point here is that the current study is building on this previous work to suggest future possibilities. 

Looking at the classes, the Future class is for when the citation is used to suggest future research directions. The example given for Future is similar, where it mentions "suggesting potential broader applicability" which aligns with suggesting future directions. 

Another possible class could be Support, but Support is when the citation supports the current authors' findings. In this case, it's not directly supporting their own results here but pointing towards future potential, so Future seems more appropriate. Weakness isn't the case here because there's no criticism. Usage would be if they used a method from the cited work, which isn't happening here. Neutral doesn't fit because the context is forward-looking. 

So the correct class should be Future.
