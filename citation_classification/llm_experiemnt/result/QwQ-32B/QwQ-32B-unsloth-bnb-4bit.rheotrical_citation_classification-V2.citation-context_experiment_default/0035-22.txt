Okay, let's see. The user provided a citation passage and wants me to classify it into one of the rhetorical classes. The example given is about a study where applying a magnetic field prevents scale formation, but the mechanism isn't explained, so the current work aims to understand that. The citation is to their previous research.

Hmm, the task is to figure out which class this falls into. Let me look at the options again. The possible classes include Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, Weakness.

The example says, "Our previous research (CITSEG) has shown that... The explanation of the phenomena is not yet offered and the purpose of this work is to try to understand the mechanism..." So the citation here is pointing out a prior study that found an effect but didn't explain why, and the current work is addressing that gap. 

Looking at the Motivation class's example: "Our previous research (CITSEG) has shown... The explanation... is not yet offered and the purpose of this work is to try..." That's exactly the example given here. So the citation is used to state that there's a knowledge gap, motivating the current research. Therefore, the correct class should be Motivation. Let me check if any other class fits better. 

Basis is when it's the foundation. But here, the current work is building on the previous by explaining the mechanism, so maybe Basis? Wait, the example for Motivation matches exactly. The key here is that the citation identifies a knowledge gap, which justifies why the current research is done. Basis would be more about the cited work being the foundation for the new solution, like continuing prior work. Here, they're explaining that since the previous didn't explain the mechanism, they're doing that now. So Motivation seems correct. I don't think it's Support because it's not supporting a claim but motivating the need for the study. 

Yes, the example given in the Motivation class is the same structure, so the answer is Motivation.
