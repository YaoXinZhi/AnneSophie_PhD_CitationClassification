Okay, let's tackle this classification problem. The user provided a citation passage related to plant health, and I need to figure out the correct rhetorical class for the (CITSEG) citation. First, I'll read the example carefully.

The example given is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)."

Hmm, so I need to parse this sentence. The key part is comparing the current results with those from previous experiments. The citation is pointing out that their results are different from what was found before. 

Looking at the classes, CoCoRes is for comparing results directly. The example for CoCoRes is exactly this situation. The user's own example under CoCoRes matches this structure: contrasting results between the current study and prior work. 

Let me cross-check with other classes to be sure. CoCoGM is about goals or methods, but here it's about results. Support would be if they agreed, but they're differing. Weakness is criticizing, but the citation here is just comparing, not pointing out flaws. So yeah, CoCoRes fits.
