Okay, let's tackle this classification. The user provided a citation passage and needs to determine the rhetorical class for (CITSEG). The example given is: "Similarly, a small aphid gut binding peptide was shown to interfere with enamovirus uptake from pea aphid gut into the hemocoel; the peptide also bound to gut epithelia of two other aphid species suggesting potential broader applicability (CITSEG)."

First, I need to recall the classes. The task is to figure out which one fits best here. Let me go through each possible class again.

Looking at the sentence structure. The key part here is "suggesting potential broader applicability (CITSEG)". The citation here is used to indicate that previous work (CITSEG) suggests broader applicability. The current work is pointing out that their observation (the peptide binding to other species) might have wider applications, and they're citing another study that supports this idea of broader applicability. 

Wait, the example in the Future class is exactly similar: the example given for "Future" is "Similarly, a small aphid gut binding peptide... suggesting potential broader applicability (CITSEG)." The user even provided that as an example for the Future class. Hmm, so in the Future class's example, that exact scenario is used. 

So the task here is to see if the citation is suggesting future research directions. The phrase "suggesting potential broader applicability" implies that this could be a direction for future work. The cited work might have shown something that hints at this, so the current authors use it to suggest where to go next. 

Wait, let me check again. The example given under the Future class is the exact same sentence as the one in the problem. So in the Future class's example, that sentence is used. Therefore, according to the user's example, this should be the Future class. 

Alternatively, could it be Support or something else? Let's see. Support is when it's used to back up a claim. But here, the current authors are saying that their findings suggest broader applicability, and they cite (CITSEG) as supporting that potential. Maybe the cited work provides a precedent or similar findings that indicate this possibility. 

Wait, but the example for Future is exactly this case. The example under Future's definition says "suggesting potential broader applicability (CITSEG)", so the correct answer is Future. Therefore, I need to output "Future".
