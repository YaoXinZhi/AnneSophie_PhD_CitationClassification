Okay, I need to figure out which rhetorical class the citation (CITSEG) falls into based on the given example. Let me start by reading the example passage again carefully.

The example says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)." 

The task is to assign one of the predefined classes like Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, etc. Let's go through each class definition again to see which fits best.

First, the sentence mentions that their current results "substantially differ from the results" of the cited work. The key point here is comparing their results with the cited study's results. 

Looking at the classes, CoCoRes is for when the citation compares results or findings between the citing paper and the cited work. The example given for CoCoRes is almost exactly like the passage here: "The results obtained in the present work... differ from... (CITSEG)". That matches perfectly with CoCoRes. 

Let me check other classes to be sure. CoCoXY is for comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies, but here it's the citing paper对比 the cited results. So not CoCoXY. Support is when the citation supports the authors' claims, but here they are contrasting, not supporting. Weakness is for criticizing the cited work's flaws, but the example is about differing results, not pointing out flaws. The comparison here is direct on the results, so CoCoRes is the right choice.
