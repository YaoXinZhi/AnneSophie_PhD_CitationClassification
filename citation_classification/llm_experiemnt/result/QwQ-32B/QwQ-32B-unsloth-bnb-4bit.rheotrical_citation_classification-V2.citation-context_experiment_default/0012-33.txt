Okay, I need to classify the citation in the given example. The example is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)." 

First, let's look at the possible classes. The user mentioned CoCoRes is for comparing results directly. The sentence here is saying that their results are different from those in the cited work. The key phrase here is "substantially differ from the results". That sounds like a direct comparison of the outcomes. 

CoCoGM is about comparing goals or methods, but here it's about the results. The comparison is between the current results and the cited ones. So, the rhetorical class should be CoCoRes. 

Wait, let me check the CoCoRes example again. The example given was: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results ... (CITSEG)." Oh, wait, that's exactly the same example in the user's CoCoRes description. So, this must be CoCoRes. Therefore, the correct label is CoCoRes.
