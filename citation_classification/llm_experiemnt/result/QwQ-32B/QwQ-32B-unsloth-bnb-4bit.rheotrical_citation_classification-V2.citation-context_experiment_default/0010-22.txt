Okay, let's tackle this classification. The user provided a citation passage and I need to figure out the correct rhetorical class.

First, the example given is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)."

Looking at the possible classes, I need to see which one fits best here. The sentence is comparing the current results with the cited work's results. The key phrase here is "substantially differ from the results of the experiments". 

Checking the definitions: 
- CoCoRes is for comparing results directly. 
- CoCoGM is about goals or methods, which isn't the case here. 
- Weakness is about criticizing, which isn't exactly stated here, just a difference in results. 
- Support would be if the citation was backing their results, but since they're contrasting, that's not it either. 

The example given under CoCoRes is nearly identical: "The results obtained...substantially differ from... (CITSEG)". That matches exactly with the user's example. So the correct class should be CoCoRes.
