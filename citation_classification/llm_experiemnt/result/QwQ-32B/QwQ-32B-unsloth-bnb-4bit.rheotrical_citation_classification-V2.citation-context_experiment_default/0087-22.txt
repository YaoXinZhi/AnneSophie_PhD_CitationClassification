Okay, I need to figure out the rhetorical class for this citation. Let me start by reading the example given.

The user provided a passage: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)." 

The task is to assign one of the predefined classes to the citation here. Let me recall the classes again. 

Looking at the options, especially CoCoRes which is for comparing results. The sentence says the current results "substantially differ from" the cited work's results. That's a direct comparison of the results, so CoCoRes seems right. 

Wait, are there other possibilities? Let me check. The example given for CoCoRes is similar: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results... (CITSEG)." Oh, wait, that's exactly the same structure as the example provided under CoCoRes. So that's a clear match. 

So the answer should be CoCoRes. I don't think any other class fits here. It's not Support because they are contrasting, not agreeing. Not CoCoGM because it's about results, not methods or goals. Definitely CoCoRes.

CoCoRes
