Alright, let's tackle this classification. The user provided a passage about plant health and needs to determine the rhetorical class of the citation (CITSEG). 

First, I need to read the example passage carefully. The example given is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)."

Looking at the classes again to make sure I'm matching the right one. The key here is that the passage is comparing the current results with those from the cited work. The phrase "substantially differ from the results" stands out. 

Checking the definitions: CoCoRes is for comparing results. The example provided under CoCoRes matches this scenario exactly. The other classes like CoCoGM or Weakness don't fit because it's specifically about results differing, not methods or pointing out flaws. 

Wait, is there any chance it could be Weakness? No, because the cited work's results are being contrasted, not criticized for being flawed. The focus is on the difference in results between the current study and the cited one. 

So the correct class here should be CoCoRes.

CoCoRes
