Okay, let me try to work through this example. The user provided a passage: "The experimental set-up was described in details previously (CITSEG)." And we need to classify the citation's rhetorical class.

First, I'll recall the classes. The one that stands out here is "Usage," because the sentence says they used a previously described experimental setup. The citation here is referring to a method or experimental setup that's being directly used in the current study. 

Looking at the "Usage" example given: "The experimental set-up was described in details previously (CITSEG)"â€”that's exactly the same structure as the example provided for the Usage class. The example for Usage says it's when a method or setup from the cited work is used directly. So this seems like a clear match.

I'll check other classes to make sure. "Basis" is about foundational work, but here it's more about the setup. "Support" would be if they're using the citation to back a claim, but here it's just stating they used the same setup. "Neutral" is possible, but the key here is that they're referring to using a previously described method, which fits Usage. So the answer should be Usage.
