Okay, I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in the given passage. Let me read the example again. The user provided a passage where (CITSEG) is mentioned, and I have to assign it one of the predefined classes like Basis, CoCoGM, etc.

The example given is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)." 

Hmm, the key here is that the current paper's results are being compared directly with the cited work's results. The phrase "substantially differ from the results" is a strong indicator. Let me check the classes again.

Looking at the CoCoRes class: it's for when the citation is used to compare or contrast results or findings with the citing paper. That seems to fit here because the passage is highlighting a difference in results between their work and the cited one. 

The other options: CoCoXY is when comparing two cited studies, but here it's the current paper vs the cited. Support would be if they were agreeing, but they're contrasting. Basis is if the cited work is foundational, which isn't the case here. So yes, CoCoRes is the right choice.
