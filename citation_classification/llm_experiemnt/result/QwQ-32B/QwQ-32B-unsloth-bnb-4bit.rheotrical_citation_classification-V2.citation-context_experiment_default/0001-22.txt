Okay, let me tackle this classification. The user provided a citation passage, and I need to figure out which rhetorical class it belongs to. The example given is about a citation where the results differ from previous studies. The passage says, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)." 

First, I need to recall the definitions of the classes. CoCoRes is for when the citation compares or contrasts results directly with the citing paper's results. The example given for CoCoRes matches exactly this scenario. The key here is that the current study's results are being contrasted with those of the cited work. 

Looking at other classes: CoCoGM is about goals or methods, which isn't the case here. Support would be if the citation was backing up the current findings, but since they are contrasting, that's not it. Basis is about foundational work, which doesn't fit. Future, Motivation, Similar, Weakness, and Neutral also don't apply because they involve different roles like suggesting future work, justifying the study, similarity in findings, criticism, or neutral mention.

So the citation is directly comparing the results of the current work with those of the cited study, which aligns perfectly with CoCoRes. Therefore, the correct class here should be CoCoRes.
