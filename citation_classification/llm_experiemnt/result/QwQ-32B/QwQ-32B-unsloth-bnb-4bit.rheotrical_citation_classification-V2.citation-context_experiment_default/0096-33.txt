Okay, I need to classify the rhetorical class for the citation in the given example. Let me start by reading the example passage carefully. The example for CoCoRes says, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)." 

So the task is to determine what class (CITSEG) falls into here. The key here is that the passage is directly comparing the current results with those from the cited work. The phrase "substantially differ from the results" indicates a direct comparison of the outcomes or findings between the two studies.

Looking at the classes, CoCoRes is for comparing results. Let me check other classes to be sure. CoCoGM is about goals or methods, which isn't the case here. Support would be if the citation was backing up a claim, but here it's contrasting. Basis is about foundation, which doesn't fit. Weakness is criticism, but the example here isn't necessarily pointing out a flaw, just a difference in results. So yes, CoCoRes is the right class here. The citation is used to show a contrast in results between the current work and the cited one.
