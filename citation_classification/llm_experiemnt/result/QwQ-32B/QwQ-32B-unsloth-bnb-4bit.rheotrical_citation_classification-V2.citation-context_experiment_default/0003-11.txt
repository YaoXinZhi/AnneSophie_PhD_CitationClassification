Okay, I need to classify the rhetorical class for the citation in the given example. Let me first read the example again carefully. The example provided is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)." 

The task is to determine which of the predefined rhetorical classes this citation falls into. Let me go through each possible class to see which fits best.

First, looking at the possible classes:

- **Basis**: If the cited work is the foundation or continuation of the current research. The example here is about comparing results, not being a foundation. Doesn't fit.

- **CoCoGM (Comparison of Goals/Methods)**: This is for comparing research goals or methods between cited and current work. The example mentions differences in results, not goals or methods. Not this one.

- **CoCoRes (Comparison of Results)**: This is when results or findings are directly compared. The sentence says the results "substantially differ from the results of the experiments..." which directly compares findings. This looks like a good fit.

- **CoCoXY (Comparison of Explanations or Claims)**: This is for comparing two cited studies with each other, not the current work. The example here is comparing the current work's results with the cited work's, so this isn't it.

- **Future**: If the citation suggests future research. The example is about contrasting results, so not this.

- **Motivation**: If it's justifying why the current research is needed. The example is a comparison, not motivation.

- **Neutral**: Used neutrally without supporting or comparing. But here the comparison is clear, so not neutral.

- **Similar**: For pointing out similarities. The sentence says there's a difference, so no.

- **Support**: If it supports the current findings. Since the results differ, it's contrasting, not supporting.

- **Usage**: If the cited work's method is used. Not the case here.

- **Weakness**: If pointing out flaws in the cited work. The example is comparing results, not criticizing the cited work's quality.

So the best fit is **CoCoRes**, because the passage directly compares the results of the current work with the cited study's results.
