Okay, let me try to figure out the rhetorical class for this citation. The user provided a passage where (CITSEG) is mentioned. I need to read the example carefully.

The example given is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)." 

Hmm, the key here is that they're comparing their results to the cited work's results. The phrase "substantially differ from the results" stands out. The rhetorical classes include CoCoRes, which is for comparing results. Let me check the definitions again. 

CoCoRes is when the citation directly compares or contrasts results or findings between the citing paper and the cited work. That seems to fit. The other options: CoCoGM is about goals or methods, which isn't the case here. Support would be if they agreed, but they're contrasting. Weakness is about pointing out flaws, which isn't mentioned. So CoCoRes is the right choice.
