Alright, let me tackle this classification step by step. The user provided a citation passage and needs to classify the rhetorical class of (CITSEG). First, I need to understand the context given. The example here is: "The experimental set-up was described in details previously (CITSEG)." 

So, the task is to figure out why the citation is being used here. Let me recall the classes. The "Usage" class is for when a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup from the cited work is directly used in the current study. The example given for Usage is exactly a situation where the experimental setup is referenced from a previous work. 

Looking at the passage, the authors are stating that their current experimental setup was described in detail in a previous study. That sounds exactly like the Usage class because they are using a previously described setup. 

Now, cross-verifying with other classes to be sure. Could it be Support? Support is when the citation supports a claim. Here, it's not supporting a result or claim but referring to the method/setup. Basis is about foundational work, but the sentence doesn't indicate that the cited work is the foundation, just that the setup was described there. Neutral is possible, but "described in details" implies they are using that prior description, so Usage fits better. 

No signs of comparison, so CoCo classes are out. The citation isn't pointing out a similarity (Similar) or motivating the research (Motivation). It's straightforwardly referring to a prior description of their method, so Usage is correct.
