Okay, I need to determine the rhetorical class for the citation in the given passage. The example provided is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)." 

First, I'll look at the predefined classes. The key here is that the passage is comparing the current results with those of the cited work. The phrase "substantially differ from the results" stands out. 

Checking the classes, CoCoRes is for when the citation compares results or findings directly. The example given for CoCoRes matches this scenario exactly. The other classes like Comparison of Goals/Methods (CoCoGM) or Comparison of Explanations (CoCoXY) don't fit because the comparison here is specifically about results. The citation isn't being used to support, motivate, or suggest future work, so Support, Motivation, or Future are out. It's not pointing out a similarity either, since it's about differences. Therefore, the correct class should be CoCoRes.
