Okay, let me start by reading the given citation passage and the task carefully. The task is to classify the rhetorical class of the citation marked as (CITSEG) in the provided example. The possible classes are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, Weakness. 

The example given for the task is: "The experimental set-up was described in details previously (CITSEG)." 

I need to figure out which class this example belongs to. Let me look through the descriptions of each class again to see which fits best.

First, the example mentions that the experimental setup was described in detail in the cited work. The key here is that the current paper is using a method or setup that was previously described. The Usage class is defined as when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup from the cited work that is directly used in the current study. That seems to fit perfectly here because they're using the experimental setup from the cited work.

Let me check other classes to be thorough. Support is for when the citation supports a claim, but here it's more about the method being used rather than supporting a claim. Basis is about intellectual foundation, which might not apply here as it's a specific method. Neutral is descriptive but not in this context. The example clearly states the setup was described before, so they are using the prior work's setup, making Usage the correct class.
