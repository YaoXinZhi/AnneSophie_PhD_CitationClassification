Okay, so I need to figure out the right rhetorical class for this citation. Let me start by reading the example given. The user provided an example where the passage says, "The experimental set-up was described in details previously (CITSEG)." The correct class here is "Usage" because they're referring to a method or setup used from the cited work.

Now, the task is to apply this to a new passage. Wait, actually, the user's prompt is a general one for classification. But in their example, they showed that when the citation is about using a method from another study, it's "Usage." The key here is to look at how the citation is being used in the sentence. 

Let me check the classes again. The "Usage" class is when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or setup used in the current study. The example given fits that. So if another passage says something like "We used the method described by (CITSEG) to analyze the data," that's also Usage. 

But I need to make sure I'm not mixing it up with other classes. "Basis" is when the cited work is foundational. "Support" is when it's used to back up the authors' claim. "Similar" points out similarity. If the sentence mentions using something directly from the cited work in their own study, that's definitely Usage. 

So, the example given by the user is straightforward. The experimental setup was described before, and they're using that same setup here, so citing the previous work where the setup was detailed. Therefore, the correct class is "Usage."
