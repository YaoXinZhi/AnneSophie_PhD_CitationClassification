Okay, I need to figure out the correct rhetorical class for the citation in this plant health passage. Let me start by reading the example given. The user provided a passage where the citation is marked as (CITSEG), and I have to determine the class based on how it's used.

Looking at the example: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)." 

The key here is that the current study's results are being compared directly with those of the cited work. The phrase "substantially differ from the results" indicates a direct comparison of their findings. The rhetorical classes I need to consider are the ones related to comparison. 

Checking the classes, CoCoRes is for comparing results. The example provided under CoCoRes matches this scenario exactly. The other options like CoCoGM (methods/goals) or CoCoXY (comparing explanations between cited works) don't fit. The citation here is contrasting the current results with the cited study's results, so CoCoRes is the right choice.
