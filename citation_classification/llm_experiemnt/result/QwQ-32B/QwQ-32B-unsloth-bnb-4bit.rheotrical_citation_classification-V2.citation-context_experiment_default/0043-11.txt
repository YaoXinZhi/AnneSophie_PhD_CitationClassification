Okay, I need to determine the rhetorical class for the citation in the given passage. Let me read the example carefully. The user provided a passage: "Similarly, a small aphid gut binding peptide was shown to interfere with enamovirus uptake from pea aphid gut into the hemocoel; the peptide also bound to gut epithelia of two other aphid species suggesting potential broader applicability (CITSEG)." The task is to classify the citation here.

First, let me recall the classes. The options are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, Weakness. 

Looking at the example sentence, the key phrase is "suggesting potential broader applicability (CITSEG)". The citation here is pointing out that the previous work's findings suggest future possibilities or directions. The word "suggesting" and "broader applicability" indicates that the authors are using the citation to imply where future research could go. 

Comparing to the classes, the Future class is for when the citation is used to suggest future research. The example given for Future is exactly about suggesting applicability leading to future directions. 

Let me check other possible classes. Support would be if it's confirming a claim. Here it's more about the implication for future work rather than supporting the current study's findings. Similar is about pointing out similarities, which isn't the case here. Weakness is about criticizing, which isn't happening. So Future seems correct.
