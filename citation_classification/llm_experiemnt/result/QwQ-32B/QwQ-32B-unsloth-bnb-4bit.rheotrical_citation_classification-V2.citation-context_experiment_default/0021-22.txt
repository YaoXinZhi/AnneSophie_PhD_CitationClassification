Alright, let's tackle this classification problem. The user provided a citation passage from a scientific article and needs to determine its rhetorical class. My task is to figure out the right class for the given example. 

First, I need to recall the different rhetorical classes listed. The options are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, and Weakness. 

The example given here is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)."

Okay, breaking this down. The key sentence is contrasting the current results with previous ones. The phrase "substantially differ from the results" is a strong indicator. 

Looking at the classes, CoCoRes is for when results are compared directly. The example provided under CoCoRes is almost identical to the given sentence. The citation here is pointing out a difference in results between the current study and the cited work. That fits CoCoRes because it's a direct comparison of results.

I should check other possibilities. CoCoGM is about methods or goals, but here it's specifically about results. Support would be if the cited work's results align, but the wording here is contrasting. Motivation is about justifying the research, which isn't the case here. Future points to directions, which isn't mentioned. Neutral is just descriptive without comparison, but there's a clear comparison here. Weakness would be if they're pointing out flaws in the cited work, but the sentence is about differing results not that one is incorrect. 

So CoCoRes seems correct here. The label should be "CoCoRes".
