Okay, let me tackle this classification step by step. The user provided a passage and needs to determine the rhetorical class for the citation (CITSEG). The task is to assign the most appropriate class from the list given. 

First, I need to read the example passage carefully. The example given is: "The experimental set-up was described in details previously (CITSEG)."

Looking at the possible classes, I should check which one fits best. The key here is to see why the citation is mentioned. The sentence says that the experimental setup was described in detail before, so the authors are referencing a previous work where their setup was explained.

Checking the classes: The "Usage" class is defined as when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup from the cited work that is directly used in the current study. That matches exactly with this case because the current study is using the experimental setup described in the cited work.

Other classes like Support or Basis might involve supporting a claim or being foundational, but here it's specifically about using a previously described setup. Neutral could be possible, but the mention here isn't just descriptive; it's pointing out that the experimental details were from a prior work, which is a direct usage. 

Therefore, the correct class should be "Usage".
