Okay, let's see. I need to figure out which rhetorical class the citation here falls into. The example given is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)." 

The task is to assign the correct class from the list provided. Let me go through the classes again.

First, Basis is when the cited work is the foundation of the current research. But here, the focus is on differing results, so probably not Basis. 

CoCoGM is about comparing goals or methods. The example here is about results differing, so maybe not that. 

CoCoRes is for comparing results directly. The example given in the prompt for CoCoRes says "substantially differ from the results" which matches exactly the example here. So that seems like a strong candidate.

CoCoXY is comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies, but here it's the citing paper vs the cited one, not two cited studies. So probably not.

Future is about suggesting future research. No, this is about comparing results. 

Motivation is justifying why the research is done. Not here.

Neutral is just descriptive without argument. But here they are contrasting results, so not neutral.

Similar is pointing out similarity, but here it's a difference, so not similar.

Support is when supporting the claim. Here they are contrasting, so not support.

Usage is using a method, which isn't the case here.

Weakness is criticizing the cited work. But the citation here is just stating that their results differ, not necessarily criticizing the cited work's flaws. It's more about contrasting results, so CoCoRes fits better.

Therefore, the correct class should be CoCoRes.
