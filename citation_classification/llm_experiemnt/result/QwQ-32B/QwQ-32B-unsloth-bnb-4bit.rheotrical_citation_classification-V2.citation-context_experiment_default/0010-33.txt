Okay, so I need to figure out which rhetorical class the citation (CITSEG) falls into based on the provided example. Let me read the example again carefully.

The example given is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)."

Hmm. The key here is looking at how the citation is used. The sentence says that the current results differ from the cited work's results. That sounds like a direct comparison between the results of the two studies. Let me check the classes again.

Looking at CoCoRes, which is for comparing results or findings. The example provided for CoCoRes is almost identical: the results differ from (CITSEG). So this should be CoCoRes. 

Wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up with CoCoGM or CoCoXY. CoCoGM is about goals or methods, and CoCoXY is comparing explanations or claims between cited studies, not with the citing paper. Here, the citing paper is comparing their own results with the cited one's, so that's exactly CoCoRes. Yeah, that's the one. The sentence structure matches the example given for CoCoRes. So the answer must be CoCoRes.

CoCoRes
