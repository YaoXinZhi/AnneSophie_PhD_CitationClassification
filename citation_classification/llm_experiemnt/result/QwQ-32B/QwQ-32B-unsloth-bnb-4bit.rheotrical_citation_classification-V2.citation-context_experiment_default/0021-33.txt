Okay, let's tackle this classification problem. The user provided a citation passage, and I need to figure out the correct rhetorical class for (CITSEG). Let me first recall the classes to make sure I remember them correctly.

The task is to assign one of the predefined classes like Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, etc. 

The example given here is: "The experimental set-up was described in details previously (CITSEG)." 

Hmm, the key part here is that the current study is using a method or setup from a previous work. The sentence says they described the setup before, so they are referring to that prior work as the method they're using now. 

Looking at the classes, "Usage" is when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or setup used in the current study. That seems to fit here. The example under Usage in the prompt matches exactly: "The experimental set-up was described in details previously (CITSEG)" which is the same as the example here. 

Let me double-check other possible classes. Could this be "Basis"? Basis is when the cited work is the foundation of the current research. But here it's more about using the setup, not necessarily the foundational theory. "Support" would be if they're using the citation to back up a claim, but here it's about describing their own setup by referencing where it was detailed before. 

So I think "Usage" is the right class here. The authors are pointing out that their experimental setup was previously described elsewhere, so they're using that prior work's method. 

I don't see any indication of comparison, motivation, or other classes. Definitely not "Weakness" since there's no criticism. "Neutral" is possible but the key here is that they are reusing a setup from the cited work, which falls under "Usage".
