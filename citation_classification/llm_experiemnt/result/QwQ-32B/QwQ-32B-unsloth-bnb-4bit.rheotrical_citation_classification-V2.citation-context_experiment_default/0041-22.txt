Okay, let me try to figure out the right class for this citation. The user provided a passage where the citation is mentioned, and I need to classify it into one of the rhetorical categories. 

First, I should recall the definitions of each class to make sure I understand them correctly. The task is to determine what role the citation plays in the current paper. The options are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, Weakness. 

Looking at the example given: "The experimental set-up was described in details previously (CITSEG)." The correct class here is Usage because the citation is referring to a method or experimental setup that's being used directly in the current study. 

So, the key here is that the current paper is using something (like a method) from the cited work. The phrase "experimental set-up" is a clear indicator of usage. The citation is pointing out that the setup they used was previously described elsewhere. That fits under the Usage category because they're directly utilizing a prior method. 

I should check other possible categories to make sure. Is it Support? If they were saying the previous work supports their setup's validity, maybe. But the example specifically mentions that the setup was described before, not necessarily endorsing it as evidence. It's more about referencing where the method was first detailed, which aligns with Usage. 

No, Support would be if they used the citation to back up a claim they're making. Here, they're just citing the source of the method they employed. So yes, Usage is correct here.
