Okay, let's tackle this classification problem. The user provided a citation passage and wants me to determine which rhetorical class it belongs to. The citation is marked with (CITSEG). 

First, I need to read the example carefully. The passage says: "Similarly, a small aphid gut binding peptide was shown to interfere with enamovirus uptake from pea aphid gut into the hemocoel; the peptide also bound to gut epithelia of two other aphid species suggesting potential broader applicability (CITSEG)."

So the sentence is talking about a previous study that found a peptide's effect on virus uptake and its binding to other aphid species. The current sentence mentions this as something that also suggests broader applicability. 

Looking at the classes, the key here is to figure out why the citation is being used here. The example seems to be using the cited work to suggest that there's potential for broader application, which might point towards future research directions. The phrase "suggesting potential broader applicability" is key here. 

Looking at the rhetorical classes, the Future class is for when the citation is used to suggest future research. The example given for Future is similar: "suggesting potential broader applicability (CITSEG)" matches the example's structure where it points to future possibilities. 

Alternatively, another possible class could be Support if it's reinforcing a claim, but the wording here is more about suggesting what could be done next, not just supporting the current findings. 

CoCoRes or Similar are about comparing results or similarities, but the sentence isn't contrasting or showing similarity, it's pointing towards future applications. Weakness is about criticism, which isn't the case here. 

Therefore, the correct class should be Future.
