Okay, let's see. I need to classify the rhetorical class of the citation in the given passage. The user mentioned it's in the plant health domain, but the example provided is a general one. Let me start by reading the example carefully.

The example given is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)." 

They want to know which class this falls into. Let me check the definitions again. The classes are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, Weakness.

Looking at the example sentence, it says the current results "substantially differ from the results" of the cited experiments. That's a direct comparison of the results between the current work and the cited one. According to the classes, CoCoRes is for when the citation is used to compare or contrast results with the citing paper. The example provided under CoCoRes matches exactly this scenario. The key here is that it's comparing their own results with the cited study's results. So the correct class here should be CoCoRes.

CoCoRes
