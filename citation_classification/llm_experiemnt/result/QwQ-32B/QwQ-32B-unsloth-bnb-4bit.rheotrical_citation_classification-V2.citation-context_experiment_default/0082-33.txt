Okay, I need to figure out the correct rhetorical class for the citation in the given example. The user provided a specific example for each class, so I should compare the given passage to those examples.

The example given for CoCoRes is when the citation compares results between the current work and the cited work. The example says, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)." Here, the citation is used to contrast their results with previous ones.

Looking at the user's task example for the question: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)." The citation is directly comparing the current results with the cited study's results. So the class here should be CoCoRes because it's a comparison of results.

Wait, but the user is asking me to process a new input passage, but in the problem statement, they just presented the example for CoCoRes. The actual task is to assign the correct class to a new citation passage provided by the user. However, in the current query, the user pasted the entire prompt, including the example. But the user's actual input might be a different passage. Wait, looking back, the user's query is the prompt for classification, but they want me to process a specific example. Wait, maybe I need to check the exact input given. 

Wait the user says: "Prompt for citation classification" followed by all the details. But perhaps the actual query is the example given in the CoCoRes section. Let me read again.

The user provides the task, classes, examples, and then says "Output Format..." So perhaps the actual input they want me to classify is the example under CoCoRes: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)."

In that case, the correct label would be CoCoRes because it's a direct comparison of results between the current work and the cited one. The sentence structure is explicitly stating that their results differ from the cited work's results, so the rhetorical class is CoCoRes.
