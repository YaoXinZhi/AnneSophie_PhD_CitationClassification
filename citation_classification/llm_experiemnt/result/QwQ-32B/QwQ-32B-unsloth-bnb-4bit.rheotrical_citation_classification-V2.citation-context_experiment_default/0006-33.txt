Okay, let me try to work through this step by step. So I need to figure out which rhetorical class the citation in the given passage falls into. The example provided is:

"The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)."

First, I'll look at the options again because it's crucial to pick the right one. The user listed several classes like Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, Weakness. 

Let me focus on what the sentence says. The key part here is "substantially differ from the results of the experiments..." The sentence is comparing the current study's results with the results from the cited work. The phrase "differ from the results" really stands out. 

Now, checking the classes: CoCoRes is defined as when the citation is used to directly compare or contrast the results or findings between the citing paper and the cited work. That seems exactly like what's happening here. The current study's results are being contrasted with the cited study's results. 

Let me double-check the other possibilities. CoCoGM compares goals or methods, not results. Support is when it aligns or reinforces the claim, but here it's a contrast. Weakness would involve pointing out flaws, which isn't happening here. Neutral would just mention without supporting/contrasting, but the comparison is explicit. So yeah, CoCoRes is the right one.
