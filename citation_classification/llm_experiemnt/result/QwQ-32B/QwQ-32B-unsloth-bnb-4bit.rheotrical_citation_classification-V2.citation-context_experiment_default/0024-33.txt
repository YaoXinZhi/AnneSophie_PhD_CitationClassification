Okay, so I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in this passage. Let me read through the example given. The user provided a passage where (CITSEG) is mentioned. The task is to determine which of the predefined classes fits best.

The example given is: "The experimental set-up was described in details previously (CITSEG)." The question is, which class does this fall into? The options are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, Weakness.

Looking at the Usage class description: "Assign this class when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup from the cited work that is directly used in the current study." The example provided for Usage is exactly this scenario: "The experimental set-up was described in details previously (CITSEG)." 

So in this case, the citation is referring to the experimental setup that was used in the current study, which is exactly what the Usage class is for. There's no indication here of comparison (CoCoGM/CoCoRes), motivation, or support for a claim. It's purely stating that the setup was described before, so they're using the prior work's setup. Therefore, the correct class should be Usage.
