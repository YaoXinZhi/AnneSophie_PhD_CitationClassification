Okay, let me see. I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation here. The example given is about assigning a class based on how the citation is used in the passage. The user provided a list of classes like Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, etc. 

The task here is to look at the citation in the passage and determine its role. The example given under CoCoXY is when the citation is used to compare or contrast two cited studies with each other, not with the citing paper. The example there mentions contradictory results among references.

Now, looking at the user's example for the prompt: "However, a review of the available literature is rather confusing due to the often contradictory results that were reported. [REF1-REF12]". Here, the citation is pointing out that several studies have contradictory findings, so the class is CoCoXY because it's comparing the cited studies themselves.

The key here is that the citation is highlighting a对比 or comparison between the cited works, not between the cited work and the current paper. So the rhetorical class would be CoCoXY. The user's example seems to exactly match this scenario where multiple references are cited to show conflicting results among them. Therefore, the correct label should be CoCoXY.
