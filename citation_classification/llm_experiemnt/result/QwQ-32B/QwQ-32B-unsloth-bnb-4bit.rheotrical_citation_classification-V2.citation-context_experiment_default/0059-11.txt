Okay, let me tackle this classification problem. The user wants me to assign a rhetorical class to the citation in the given passage. The example they provided is about magnetic water treatment devices in the USA. The citation is mentioned in the context of the spread since 1975.

First, I need to recall the classes. The options are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, Weakness.

Looking at the example for "Neutral" class: "in the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 (CITSEG)." The citation here is just providing a factual statement without any argumentative role like supporting a claim or comparing methods. The example says Neutral is for neutral, descriptive use without supporting or criticizing. 

The other classes don't fit here. There's no indication of comparison (CoCoGM/CoCoRes), motivation, or support. It's just stating a fact about when the use started. The "Usage" class refers to using a method/tool, which isn't the case here. The citation is merely citing a historical fact. So the correct class should be Neutral.
