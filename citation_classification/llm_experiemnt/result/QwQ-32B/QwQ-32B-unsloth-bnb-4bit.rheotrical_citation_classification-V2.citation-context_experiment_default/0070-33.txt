Okay, let's see. The task is to classify the rhetorical class for the citation in the given passage. The user provided an example where the citation is in the context of the aphid gut peptide interfering with virus uptake and suggesting broader applicability. The options are classes like Future, Motivation, Support, etc.

The example says the citation here is about a peptide that might have broader applicability, and the example under Future says it's used to suggest future research directions. The example given for Future is similar: "suggesting potential broader applicability (CITSEG)" which matches exactly the scenario here. The key phrase is "suggesting potential broader applicability," which implies that the current work sees this as a direction for future research. So the class should be Future.

Wait, the user's example in the Future class is: "Similarly, a small aphid gut binding peptide..." and the example here is the same. Therefore, the correct answer is Future.

Future
