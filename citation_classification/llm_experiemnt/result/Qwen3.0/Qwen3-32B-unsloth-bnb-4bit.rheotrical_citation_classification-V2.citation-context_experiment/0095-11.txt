Okay, let's see. I need to determine the rhetorical class of the citation in this text. The passage says: "Gaps and ambiguities were removed from the final dataset. 'Phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analyses were conducted by using the neighbour-joining program of the genetic analysis software MEGA, version 2.1' (CITSEG). The data were resampled 500 times and bootstrap percentage values are given at the nodes of the tree."

First, I look at the context. The authors mention using MEGA version 2.1's neighbor-joining program. The citation here is referencing the software and the method they used. The key part is that they are describing the method they used in their study. The rhetorical classes include categories like Usage, Basis, Support, etc. Let me check the definitions again.

The "Usage" class is when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup from the cited work that is directly used in the current study. Here, they used MEGA 2.1's program for their analysis. So this seems like a direct usage case. They are explaining which software and method they used, and citing the source of that method. 

Is there another possible class? Let's think. "Basis" is about the intellectual foundation, but here it's more about the specific tool or method used rather than the foundational work. "Support" would be if they were using the citation to back up their claims. But here it's more about explaining their methodology. So "Usage" fits best here.
