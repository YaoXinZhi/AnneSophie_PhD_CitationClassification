Okay, let's see. I need to determine the rhetorical class for the citation marked (CITSEG) in the given passage. The options are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, Weakness.

Looking at the passage, the citation is mentioned in the sentence: "were higher than the percentages observed in Florida, USA (8.7%) and Indonesia (45.2%) for Diaphorina citri with 'Ca.Liberibacter asiaticus' CITSEG". The next sentence says, "Such a high infection rate supports a hypothesis..." So the authors are comparing their observed infection rates with previous results from Manjunath et al.

The example for CoCoRes is when the citation is used to compare results directly. Here, they are comparing the infection rates they found with those from the cited study. The example in CoCoRes mentions differing results, but here it's about higher rates. However, the key is that they are contrasting or comparing findings. Since they mention their results being higher than previous studies, this fits CoCoRes because it's about comparing results. 

Another possible class could be Support, but Support is when the citation supports their claim. However, here they are comparing their results to previous ones to highlight a difference, which is more about contrasting results rather than supporting. The next sentence uses that comparison to support their hypothesis, but the citation itself is part of the result comparison. So CoCoRes seems appropriate here.
