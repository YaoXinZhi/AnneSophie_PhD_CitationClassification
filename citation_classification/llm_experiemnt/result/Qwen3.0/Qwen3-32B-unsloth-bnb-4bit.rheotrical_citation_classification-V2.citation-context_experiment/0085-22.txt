Okay, let's see. I need to classify the citation marked as CITSEG in the given text. The user provided several rhetorical classes, so I should check each one against the context.

The sentence in question is: "Of these crops, only peaches are susceptible to WX, and peaches have been shown to be a poor vector acquisition host of the WX phytoplasma <ref type=""bibr"" target=""#b3"">(4,</ref><ref type=""bibr"" target=""#b5"">6)</ref>. A previous report detected WX in pear by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (CITSEG) ", but these results were never repeated using DNA hybridization (B. C. Kirkpatrick, unpublished results) or PCR <ref type=""bibr"" target=""#b4"">(5)</ref>."

So the CITSEG here refers to a previous report that detected WX in pear using ELISA. The next part says that these results were never repeated with other methods. The authors are contrasting CITSEG's findings with their own attempts to replicate using different methods. Wait, but CITSEG is the previous report here. The rhetorical class should be about how the citation is used here. The authors mention that CITSEG found something, but they couldn't replicate it with other methods. This suggests that they're comparing their results to CITSEG's results. Since they are contrasting their own findings with those of CITSEG, and pointing out that CITSEG's results weren't repeated. That seems like CoCoRes, which is Comparison of Results. 

CoCoRes is when the authors compare their results with the cited work's results. Here, they state that CITSEG reported detection via ELISA, but the results weren't replicated using DNA hybridization or PCR. So they are contrasting their findings (or lack thereof) with CITSEG's ELISA results. Therefore, the correct class is CoCoRes.
