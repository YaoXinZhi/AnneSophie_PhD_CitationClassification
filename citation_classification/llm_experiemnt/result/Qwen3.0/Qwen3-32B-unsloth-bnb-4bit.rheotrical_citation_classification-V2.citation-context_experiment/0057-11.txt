Okay, let's tackle this citation classification. So, the task is to figure out which rhetorical class the CITSEG in the given text belongs to. The options are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, Weakness.

Looking at the passage: It mentions RFLP analysis and sequencing methods. The sentence says "RFLP analysis was carried out as described previously Lorenz et al., 1995 (CITSEG)." Here, the authors are referring to a previous method they used. The CITSEG is Lorenz et al. from 1995.

So the question is, what role does this citation play here? The authors are explaining their methodology. They used a method that was previously described in the Lorenz et al. paper. They're not contrasting results, just stating they followed the previously established method. 

In the examples, Usage is when the citation refers to a method or tool directly used in the current study. The example given under Usage is about an experimental setup described previously. Similarly, here they are using the RFLP method as described in Lorenz et al. So this seems like the Usage category. 

They're not supporting a claim, nor comparing goals or methods with their own current work. It's just a reference to the method they applied. The key words are "as described previously," indicating they're using that method. Therefore, the correct class should be Usage.
