Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation marked as CITSEG in this passage. Let me read through the text again.

The passage is about methods used in a study. They mention that most data were generated previously but did some additional work. The part with CITSEG says "RFLP analysis was carried out as described previously" and then CITSEG is there. Looking at the context, they're referring to how the RFLP analysis was done according to a previous method described by Lorenz et al., 1995. 

So, the citation here is being used to indicate that the method was used as previously described. The authors are basically saying they followed the same procedure as outlined in that reference. In the list of classes, the 'Usage' class is when the citation refers to a method, tool, etc., directly used in the current study. That seems to fit here because they're citing the method they followed. It's not for comparison or support, just stating they used the existing method. Neutral might be if they were just mentioning it without context, but here they're specifically saying they used it as described. So 'Usage' is the right class here.
