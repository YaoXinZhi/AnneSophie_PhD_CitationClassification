Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation (CITSEG) here. The text is talking about methods used to collect insects. The part with CITSEG is right after they mention using a mouth aspirator to collect psyllids into glass tubes and bring them to the lab. The citation there is to Tedeschi et al. 2002.

Looking at the surrounding text, they're describing the procedure: using a beat-tray method and then collecting with an aspirator. The citation here is probably referencing the method or the tool they used. The example given for the 'Usage' class mentions citing a method, tool, dataset, or setup. Since they're directly using the method described by Tedeschi et al., this should be 'Usage'. They aren't comparing results, supporting a claim, or talking about future work. It's just describing the method they used, so 'Usage' is the correct label.
