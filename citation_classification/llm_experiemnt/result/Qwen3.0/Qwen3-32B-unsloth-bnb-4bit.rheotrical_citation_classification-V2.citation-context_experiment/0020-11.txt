Okay, let's tackle this citation classification problem. The user provided a passage with a (CITSEG) placeholder where a citation appears. My task is to determine the appropriate rhetorical class from the given list.

First, I need to understand the context. The passage discusses the detection and classification of phytoplasmas using PCR amplification of ribosomal RNA genes and the 16S-23S rDNA intergenic spacer region. The CITSEG is part of a sentence mentioning several references (Bosco et al., 2002; Davies et al., 1995; Seem√ºller et al., 1998). The following sentence talks about the use of 16S rDNA sequences for classification into phylogenetic groups.

Looking at the options, possible classes include 'Use', 'Support', 'Basis', etc. The CITSEG is explaining that PCR methods have become conventional for detection and identification. The cited works are presenting established techniques that are currently used. Since the authors are stating that PCR has become the conventional means, citing these works likely serves to support their statement by referencing existing methodologies. So the citation is used to back up the claim about conventional methods, which aligns with the 'Support' class. Alternatively, if the authors are just using the method from the cited works directly in their study, it would be 'Usage'. However, here it's mentioned that PCR is the conventional means, so the citation supports that statement, not that they used the method themselves. Therefore, 'Support' seems correct.
