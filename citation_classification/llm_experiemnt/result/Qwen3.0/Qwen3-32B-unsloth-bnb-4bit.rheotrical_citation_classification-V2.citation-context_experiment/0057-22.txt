Okay, let's tackle this citation classification problem. First, I need to understand the context where the CITSEG is placed. The passage mentions "RFLP analysis was carried out as described previously..." followed by the CITSEG. The CITSEG here refers to Lorenz et al., 1995. 

Looking at the rhetorical classes, the 'Usage' class is for when the cited work provides a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup directly used in the current study. Here, the authors are referencing Lorenz et al. to describe how the RFLP analysis was performed previously, which they are following in their current work. 

They don't seem to be comparing methods (CoCoGM), supporting a claim (Support), or motivating the research (Motivation). The citation is about the method they used, so 'Usage' fits best. Neutral could be a possibility if it's just descriptive, but since they're specifically referring to the method they implemented, Usage is more accurate. 

I should double-check examples. The Usage example talks about an experimental setup described in a previous work, which matches this case where the RFLP method is detailed in Lorenz et al.
