Okay, let's see. The task is to classify the rhetorical function of the citation marked as (CITSEG) in the given passage. The options include categories like Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, etc. 

Looking at the passage, the citation in question is from Liu and Gao (1993), mentioned after a comment by Nii (1993) about phloem structures. The sentences before the citation talk about differences in sieve elements (SEs) among Rosacea species, comparing Malus/Pyrus to Prunus. The part with CITSEG states that Liu and Gao also found similar structures in Malus and Pyrus compared to Prunus.

So, the author is showing that another study (Liu and Gao) corroborates the findings of Nii regarding the similarity in phloem structures between Malus, Pyrus, and Prunus. The key point here is that Liu and Gao's results align with Nii's, supporting the observation made by the author. This would be an example of the Support class because the citation is used to confirm or reinforce a claim made in the citing paper. 

The author isn't contrasting their methods (so not CoCoGM), nor comparing results in a conflicting way (CoCoRes would require direct comparison of differing results, which isn't the case here). Instead, they're citing Liu and Gao to show agreement with Nii's findings, thus supporting their own discussion. Neutral doesn't fit because it's not just descriptiveâ€”it's serving to back up the claim that the structures are similar. Therefore, the correct class is Support.
