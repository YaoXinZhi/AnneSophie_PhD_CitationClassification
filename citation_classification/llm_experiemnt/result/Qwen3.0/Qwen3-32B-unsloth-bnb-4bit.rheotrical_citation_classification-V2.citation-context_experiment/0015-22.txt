Okay, let's look at this citation example. The passage mentions Chinese and Taiwanese Cacopsylla chinensis sequences (Lee et al., 2007) forming clusters in NJ trees based on specific gene fragments. The cited work here seems to provide data that's being used in the current study's analysis. The authors are referring to sequences from Lee et al. that are part of their own phylogenetic analysis. 

Looking at the rhetorical classes, the "Usage" class is for when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup used in the current study. Here, the sequences from Lee et al. are part of the dataset the authors are analyzing. They mention the clusters formed by these sequences, which suggests that the cited work's data is directly included in their study. 

Alternatively, could it be "Basis"? Basis is for when the cited work is the intellectual foundation. But here, it's more about using the specific data (sequences) rather than building on prior theory or methods. The "Support" class is for when the citation reinforces a claim, but the passage is describing their own findings using the cited data. 

So the best fit appears to be "Usage" because they're directly using the sequences from Lee et al. in their analysis. The citation is providing the dataset (sequences) that's part of their current study's results.
