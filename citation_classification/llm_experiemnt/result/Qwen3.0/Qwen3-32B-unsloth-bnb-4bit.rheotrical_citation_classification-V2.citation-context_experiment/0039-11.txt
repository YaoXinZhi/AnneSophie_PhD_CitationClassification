Okay, let me try to figure out the correct classification for this citation. The sentence mentions that in the second amplification of semi-nested PCR, the reverse primer L1n was used, citing Liu et al., 2007a. The placeholder (CITSEG) here refers to Schneider et al., 1995. The context is about the PCR method used to amplify the rDNA sequences. The citation is in the part where they're describing the primers used in the first amplification step. 

Looking at the rhetorical classes, the Usage class is for when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup directly used in the current study. Here, they're using the universal phytoplasma primers P1/P7 from Schneider et al., so the cited work's primers are being directly applied in their research. That fits the Usage category. There's no comparison or support being stated here, just that a specific method (the primers) from the cited paper is utilized. So I think the answer is Usage.
