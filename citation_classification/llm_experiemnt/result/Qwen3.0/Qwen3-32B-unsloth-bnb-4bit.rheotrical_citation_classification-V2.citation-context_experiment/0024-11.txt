Okay, let me try to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation here. The citation is to Firrao et al., 1994, and it's mentioned in the context of using two different pairs of ribosomal primers, one of which is AP3/AP5. The sentence says "For the analysis, the two different pairs of ribosomal primers used were: fPD/r0 1" (CITSEG) "and AP3/AP5 (Firrao et al., 1994) respectively." 

So the citation here is pointing out the specific primers used in the analysis, particularly AP3/AP5. From the examples given under the Usage class, it's about when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup used in the current study. In this case, the primer pair AP3/AP5 is being cited because the authors are directly using them in their own experiment. They mention the other primer pair as "fPD/r0 1" without a citation, which might be their own development or another source not being cited here. 

Looking at the Usage example given: "The experimental set-up was described in details previously (CITSEG)." Here, the citation is referencing a method (the experimental setup) that the current study uses, which matches the situation here where the primers are part of the experimental method. Therefore, the citation is used to indicate that the primer pair AP3/AP5 was used according to Firrao et al.'s work. So the correct class should be Usage.
