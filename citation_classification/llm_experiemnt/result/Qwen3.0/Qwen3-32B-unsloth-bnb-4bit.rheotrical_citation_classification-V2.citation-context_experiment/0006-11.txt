Okay, let's see what I need to do here. The task is to classify the citation at (CITSEG) in the given passage into one of the rhetorical classes listed. The passage describes a method for collecting psyllids using a beat-tray method and then bringing them to the lab for analysis. The citation here is linked to a reference "Tedeschi et al. 2002."

Looking at the context, the sentence says, "The psyllids were then collected... brought to the laboratory for further analyses (CITSEG)." The mention of the citation here seems to support the process described. It's explaining how psyllids were collected and handled, and the citation is probably referring to a method or previous work where this procedure was documented.

The rhetorical classes available are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, Weakness. 

The citation here is part of the methodology section. The authors are describing the methods they used. According to the example under "Usage," citations are classified under this class when they refer to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup directly used in the current study. The example given is "The experimental set-up was described in details previously (CITSEG)." Here, similar wording is used: bringing psyllids to the lab for further analyses, with the citation following, likely referencing the method used in their analysis. 

Alternatively, could it be "Support"? But in the example under Support, the citation is used to back up a claim, like confirming results with past studies. Here, the citation is more about the method they've employed. So "Usage" seems appropriate because the authors are referencing a prior study's setup that they directly use in their research. 

Checking Neutral: If it's descriptive without supporting an argument, but in this case, it's describing their methodology step, which uses a cited method. So Neutral might not be right because Usage is more specific to methods. 

CoCo classes involve comparisons, which aren't present here. Future or Motivation also don't fit as there's no mention of direction for future work or justifying the research need. Basis would be if this prior work is the foundation of their research, but this seems like a specific method cited rather than the foundational basis. 

Therefore, the correct class should be "Usage".
