Okay, let's see. I need to determine the rhetorical class for the citation in the given text. The citation is (CITSEG) Jung et al., 2003. The text mentions that Subgroups 16SrV-A, -C, -D, and -E formed a sister group to 16SrV-B, which was previously reported as the most divergent lineage. The citation here is referencing a previous study that reported this information.

Looking at the options, CoCoRes is for comparing results. Motivation is when citing due to a knowledge gap. Support is when the cited work backs up the current claim. In this case, the authors are pointing out that Jung et al. previously reported Subgroup V-B as divergent. So they're comparing their own results with that of Jung's. Wait, but the current authors are stating what Jung et al. already found. It's not a direct comparison between their results but rather referring to Jung's previous result to support their statement. Hmm.

Alternatively, Support would mean they're using Jung's work to back their own claim. The text here is stating that in their study, they recovered certain subgroups, and they say that this was previously reported. So they're citing Jung's prior finding to support their assertion about the sister group structure. That might be Support, since they're using Jung's work as evidence that aligns with their findings. Wait, but it's more about confirming a previous observation. The authors are presenting their results and saying that part of the structure was previously reported by Jung, which serves to support their finding's validity by referencing prior work. That would be Support, because they're using Jung's report to confirm their own observation. Alternatively, CoCoRes would be if they're contrasting their results with Jung's. But here it's more of agreement. So Support seems better. 

Alternatively, maybe Basis? If Jung's work was the foundation on which the current study is built. But the current text isn't about the foundation but about confirming or agreeing with a prior finding. So probably Support. The example given for Support includes "supported by recent investigations" which is similar. Therefore, the answer is Support.
