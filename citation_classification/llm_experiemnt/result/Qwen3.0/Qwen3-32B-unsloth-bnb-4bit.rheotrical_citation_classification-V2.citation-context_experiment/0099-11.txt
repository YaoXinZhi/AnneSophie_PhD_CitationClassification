Okay, let's tackle this citation classification problem step by step. First, I need to understand the context in which the citation (CITSEG) is used. The passage is discussing research related to pear decline symptoms and resistance in different tree varieties.

Looking at the specific sentence where the citation appears: "Blodgett ei ale (CITSEG) 'noted that the frequency and severity of pear decline symptoms did not vary with the scion varieties [...] or with the origin of budwood.'" The author is reporting Blodgett's findings without overtly supporting, comparing, or contrasting with their own work. They mention Blodgett's observation that symptoms didn't vary with scion types or budwood origin. 

Then, there's another citation to Westwood et ale, which states that Bartlett was most susceptible. The way Blodgett is cited here seems to present their findings as an observed result, but the author isn't directly using it to support their own argument or comparing it to their results immediately. Instead, they're contrasting it with Westwood's findings. However, the main purpose here isn't to compare the two studies but to present both as separate observations in the field. 

The key is to determine if this is a comparison of results (CoCoRes), support (Support), basis, motivation, or neutral. Since Blodgett's work is cited to show a finding that contrasts with Westwood's later findings, maybe it's a comparison between two results. However, the CoCoRes requires the citation be used to compare with the citing paper's own results. Here, the citing paper isn't presenting its own results but is comparing Blodgett and Westwood's findings. Wait, the example given for CoCoRes says the comparison is between the citing paper's results and the cited work's. But in this case, the citing paper isn't presenting its own results in this part; it's contrasting Blodgett's findings with Westwood's. 

So if the CoCoXY category is for comparing two cited studies with each other, not the citing paper, then this might fall under CoCoXY. The example for CoCoXY mentions comparing two cited studies ("However, a review of the available literature is rather confusing due to the often contradictory results that were reported."), which seems to fit. The current passage presents Blodgett's and Westwood's findings as conflicting results in the literature about scion varieties affecting pear decline symptoms. The author isn't comparing their own results to these studies but is highlighting the differing conclusions between the two cited works. 

Therefore, the correct classification should be CoCoXY because it's comparing the explanations or claims of two different cited studies (Blodgett vs. Westwood) regarding the factors affecting pear decline symptoms.
