Okay, let's see. I need to classify the citation (CITSEG) as per the given rhetorical classes. The task is to figure out which category Blodgett et al's citation falls into based on the provided examples.

Looking at the text: Blodgett et al are cited here with the statement about pear decline symptoms not varying with scion varieties or budwood origin. Then the following sentence mentions Westwood et al finding variation in susceptibility among scion varieties. The Blodgett citation is presented as an observation contrasting with Westwood's findings. 

So the author uses Blodgett to set up a comparison of claims between two studies (Blodgett and Westwood). The example under CoCoXY says to use this class when comparing two cited studies with each other, not with the citing paper. Here, the author is contrasting Blodgett's results (no variation) against Westwood's results (variation exists), so it's a comparison between the two cited works. That matches CoCoXY, not CoCoRes because CoCoRes involves comparing the citing paper's results with a cited one, whereas here both cited works are compared against each other. 

Therefore, the correct label should be CoCoXY.
