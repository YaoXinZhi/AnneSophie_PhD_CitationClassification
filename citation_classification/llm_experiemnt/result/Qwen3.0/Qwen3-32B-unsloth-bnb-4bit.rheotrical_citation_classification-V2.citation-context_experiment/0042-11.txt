Okay, let's see. The user provided a scientific passage with a citation marked as (CITSEG). My job is to classify the rhetorical role of that citation based on the given classes.

First, I need to understand the context around the CITSEG. The passage starts by stating that B. nigricornis could transmit CaLsol between carrot and potato crops. Then it mentions that even though the psyllid's eggs aren't often seen, its presence on potato crops has been confirmed by Hodkinson et al. (the CITSEG here). It also mentions that this led to yield losses in Iran. Then another citation talks about transmission not being demonstrated.

Looking at the CITSEG citation: Hodkinson et al. 1981 confirmed the reproduction and presence on potato crops. The authors are using this citation to back up the claim that B. nigricornis is present there, even though visual inspections don't show them often. The purpose here is to support the idea that this species is indeed present on potatoes, which is part of their argument about the transmission potential. 

So the rhetorical class should be "Support" because they're citing Hodkinson to support their claim about the presence of the psyllid on potato crops. The citation isn't being compared with another study or pointing out a gap, but rather confirming the presence, which reinforces their own point about transmission. So "Support" fits here.
