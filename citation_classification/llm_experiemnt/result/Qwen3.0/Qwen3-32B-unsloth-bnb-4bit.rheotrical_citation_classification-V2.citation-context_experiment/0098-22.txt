Okay, let's tackle this citation classification task. The user provided a scientific passage with a CITSEG placeholder. My job is to determine which rhetorical class it fits into from the given list.

First, I'll look at the sentence around CITSEG. The text says: "However, 'Ca. P. prunorum' infection of sweet and sour cherry was confirmed in few declining trees in Czech Republic CITSEG) and in North-Central Italy..." The CITSEG here is referring to Navrátil et al. 2001, which is cited in the Czech Republic part.

Now, considering the surrounding context, the authors are mentioning that the infection was confirmed in certain regions based on previous studies. They're using the citation to support the claim that the infection was indeed found in those areas. This seems like they are confirming their findings with existing literature. The Support class is when a citation backs up a claim. The example given under Support mentions that the cited work confirms previous research, which aligns here. The authors are reinforcing their statement about the infection being confirmed by citing Navrátil et al. So the correct class should be Support.
