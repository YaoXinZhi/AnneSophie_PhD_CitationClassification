Okay, let me try to figure out the correct rhetorical class for the citation in the given passage. 

First, the passage is talking about using the neighbor-joining (NJ) algorithm with bootstrap support in MEGA 6, based on the K2P model for DNA barcoding analyses. The sentence after that mentions that this method has been widely used in various studies, including some previous ones on pear psyllids. Then it lists several citations, including CITSEG, Amouroux et al., Kanturski et al., Song et al., etc.

The key part is where it says, "including previous studies on pear psyllids" and lists the citations. The authors mention they preferred to use the same methodology despite some limitations. So, CITSEG here is among the studies that have used the same method. The authors are comparing their results with those papers, hence implying that they are following a common approach used elsewhere. The rhetorical class seems to be about comparing their methods or results with previous works, possibly CoCoGM or CoCoRes. But looking at the example for CoCoGM, it's comparing goals or methods, while CoCoRes compares results.

In the example passage, the authors are saying they used the same methodology as those cited papers to compare results. Since they mention using the same method despite limitations, it's about comparing methods (CoCoGM) rather than their results (CoCoRes). The CoCoGM example involves a comparison of goals or methods, like saying their work is complementary or focuses on a different aspect. Here, they used the same method as cited studies to ensure comparability, hence CoCoGM fits better. The mention of "including previous studies on pear psyllids" indicates that those cited works are part of the methodological context they're aligning with. Therefore, the classification should be CoCoGM.
