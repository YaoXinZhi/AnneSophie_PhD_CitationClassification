Okay, let's tackle this citation classification problem. So the task is to assign the correct rhetorical class to the citation marked as (CITSEG) in the given passage. The options are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, or Weakness.

First, I need to look at the context around the (CITSEG). The sentence says: "Blodgett ei ale (CITSEG) noted that the frequency and severity of pear decline symptoms did not vary with the scion varieties (Bartlett, Anjou, Hardy, Farmingdale, Flemish Beauty) or with the origin of budwood." 

The citation here is referencing Blodgett et al., which the authors are using to present a finding—that certain factors (scion varieties and budwood origin) didn't affect the pear decline symptoms. Now, the next sentence contrasts this with Westwood et al. who found different susceptibility levels among different scion varieties. 

So, in the context of the passage, the authors are comparing two different studies (Blodgett and Westwood) which have conflicting results regarding scion varieties and pear decline. The purpose here seems to be contrasting their findings. Since the citation of Blodgett is being used in comparison with another study's results, this might fall under CoCoRes (Comparison of Results) or CoCoGM (Comparison of Goals or Methods). 

Wait, CoCoRes is specifically for comparing results, and CoCoGM is for comparing goals or methods. Here, the main comparison is about the findings/results—the fact that Blodgett didn't see variation with scion varieties, whereas Westwood did. So this is a direct comparison of results between the current paper's context and the cited works. But wait, actually, the current paper isn't presenting their own results here; they're comparing two cited works. 

Looking at the examples:
- CoCoRes example: Comparing results of the citing paper and the cited work.
- CoCoXY example: Comparing two cited studies with each other. 

Hmm, in the passage, the authors are contrasting Blodgett et al.'s finding (no variation) with Westwood et al.'s finding (variation by scion). Since the comparison is between two cited works (Blodgett vs Westwood) rather than between the citing paper's results and a cited work, it might fall under CoCoXY (Comparison of Explanations or Claims), which the example says is when comparing two cited studies with each other.

Wait, the example under CoCoXY says it's when the citation is used to compare two cited studies not with the citing paper. So in the given text, Blodgett's result is compared with Westwood's result. The authors are pointing out that Blodgett didn't find variation with scion varieties, whereas Westwood did. Since this is a comparison between two cited works, not involving the current study's results, it should be CoCoXY.

Alternatively, if the current paper's own results were compared to Blodgett, then it would be CoCoRes. But here, the current paper isn't presenting their own results in this context; they're discussing prior studies. So CoCoXY seems correct.

Let me double-check. The example for CoCoXY is when you have contradictory results reported in a review, so you cite multiple references and compare them. Here, the authors cite Blodgett and Westwood to contrast their findings. So yes, the rhetorical function is to compare explanations or claims between these two cited works. Therefore, the correct class for the CITSEG here is CoCoXY.
