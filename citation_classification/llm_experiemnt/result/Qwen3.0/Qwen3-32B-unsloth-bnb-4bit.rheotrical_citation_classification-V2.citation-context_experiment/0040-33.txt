Okay, let's tackle this citation classification task. First, I need to understand the context in which CITSEG is used in the given passage. The passage discusses phytoplasma-induced changes in plants, mentioning the activation of defense mechanisms via phytohormones like SA and JA-Ile, and increased ABA levels in apple leaves. The sentence with CITSEG says, "Moreover, typical symptoms... can be explained with an infection-induced imbalance of phytohormones" (CITSEG). 

Now, I need to determine the rhetorical class. The options include Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, Weakness.

Looking at the example for Support: it's when a citation supports a claim. Here, the authors are stating that the symptoms can be explained by phytohormone imbalance and cite the work. The cited study is providing evidence that aligns with their explanation. The authors aren't just describing a previous finding neutrally; they're using the citation to back up their assertion about the imbalance causing symptoms. So this seems like Support because the citation is reinforcing their claim.

It's not Neutral because Neutral would be a descriptive use without supporting an argument. Also, it's not CoCoRes since they're not comparing their results with the cited work's results. The citation is cited to support their explanation, so Support is the most appropriate class.
