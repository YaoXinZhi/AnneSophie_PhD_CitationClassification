Okay, let's try to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation marked as CITSEG here. The user is providing a scientific passage where the citation is referring to the detection of mycoplasmalike bodies in pear psylla vectors by Hibino and Schneider in 1970. The sentence says, "After 1970, mycoplasmalike bodies were detected in sieve tubes of pear trees affected with pear decline (CITSEG) and in the pear psylla vector of pear decline."

First, I need to recall the different rhetorical classes. Let's go through them again:

- **Basis**: When the cited work is the foundation for the current research.
- **CoCoGM**: Comparing goals or methods with the current paper.
- **CoCoRes**: Comparing results with the citing paper.
- **CoCoXY**: Comparing two cited studies with each other.
- **Future**: Suggesting future research based on the citation.
- **Motivation**: Justifying the need for the current research.
- **Neutral**: Neutral mention without direct argument.
- **Similar**: Pointing out similarities between cited work and current paper.
- **Support**: Supporting a claim with the citation.
- **Usage**: Using methods/tools from the cited work.
- **Weakness**: Criticizing the cited work.

Looking at the sentence, the author is stating facts about the detection of mycoplasmalike bodies both in pear trees and in the psylla vector, citing Hibino and Schneider. The citation here is providing evidence that this detection happened, supporting the fact that mycoplasmalike bodies were found in the vector as well as the trees. The authors are not comparing their own methods or results with Hibino and Schneider's, nor are they contrasting or building upon it as a basis. They're just presenting Hibino's work as factual support for that historical detection.

The key point here is that the citation is used to back up the statement that the bodies were detected in the vector. Since Hibino's study is cited to confirm that this observation was made, it's serving to support the claim made in the current text. So this fits the **Support** class because the cited work is being used to reinforce the authors' statement about the detection in the psylla vector. There's no indication that the authors are critiquing Hibino's work (so not Weakness) or using it as the foundation for their own work (Basis would be if they built upon Hibino's findings). It's a straightforward supportive citation of prior research to establish that the detection was reported.
