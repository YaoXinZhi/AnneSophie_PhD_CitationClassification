Okay, let's look at this example. The sentence in question is: "This is supported by data from (CITSEG) ", with references to Yvon et al. (2004) or Maier et al. (2013). The key phrase here is "supported by data from", which indicates that the current authors are using these cited studies to back up their own findings. The rhetorical class "Support" is used when a citation is cited to validate or reinforce a claim.

In the example given under the Support class, they cite works that align with their findings. Here, the authors mention their own findings about C. pruni being found on P. spinosa and ESFY's distribution, then say this is supported by the data from Yvon and Maier. That's classic Support because they're using previous studies to evidence their current claims. So the correct class should be Support.
