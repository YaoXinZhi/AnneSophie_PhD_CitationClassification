Okay, let's see. I need to determine the rhetorical class for the citation in the given text. The user provided examples for each class, so I need to check against those.

The citation is in the sentence: "Liu and Gao (1993) found similar phloem structures in Malus and Pyrus in comparison to Prunus, too" (CITSEG). The following sentence says the SEs in Prunus were shorter and connected to fewer companion cells compared to Malus and Pyrus.

Looking at the classes, the CoCoRes class is for comparing results. The example given there mentions comparing results of experiments. Here, the authors are comparing the phloem structures found by Liu and Gao with their own observations in Prunus. They mention similarities in the first part and then contrast the SEs and CCs. Since they are comparing their findings with the cited work's results, this seems like CoCoRes. The "similar" part might make me think of the Similar class, but the example for Similar talks about supporting findings with cited work. Here, the citation is used to set up a comparison, not just pointing out similarity. Also, the next sentence contrasts their results, so it's a direct comparison of results. The CoCoRes example says "substantially differ from the results of..." which is a contrast, but CoCoRes covers both comparing and contrasting results. So I think the correct class here is CoCoRes.
