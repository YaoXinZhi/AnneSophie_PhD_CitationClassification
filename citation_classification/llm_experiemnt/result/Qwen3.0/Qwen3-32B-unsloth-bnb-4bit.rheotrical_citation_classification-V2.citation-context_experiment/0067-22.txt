Okay, let me try to work through this. The user wants me to classify the citation in the given passage into one of the rhetorical classes.

First, I'll look at the passage provided. The sentence with the citation is: "Liu and Gao (1993) found similar phloem structures in Malus and Pyrus in comparison to Prunus, too" (CITSEG). The next sentence talks about the structure of SEs in Prunus compared to Malus and Pyrus. 

Now, the task is to determine which class this citation fits into. Let's recall the classes. The example for 'Similar' mentions pointing out similarity between cited work and the paper. The cited work here is comparing phloem structures in different species, which the current text also discusses. The authors mention Liu and Gao found similar phloem structures in Malus and Pyrus compared to Prunus. The next sentence in the passage continues the comparison, so the citation is supporting the idea that similar findings exist. 

Looking at the 'Similar' class definition: when the citation points out similarity between the cited work and the citing paper. Here, the authors are indicating that Liu and Gao's findings align with their own observations regarding phloem structures. So this seems like 'Similar'. 

But wait, the 'Support' class is when the citation is used to back up a claim. However, the example for 'Similar' is when the cited work's findings are similar to those in the citing paper. In this case, the authors are stating that Liu and Gao found similar structures, which supports their own comparison between different species. Hmm. But maybe the key is whether the citation is used to show similarity or to support a claim. 

The example for Similar says the citation points out similarity between cited work and the current paper's findings. In the given text, Liu and Gao's work is compared structurally to the current study's observation. Therefore, this would fall under 'Similar'. 

Alternatively, maybe 'Support' if the citation is used to support the idea that there's a similarity. But the class definitions need to be precise. The 'Similar' class specifically refers to citing a study to show similarity in results, patterns, etc. 

In the example given for 'Similar', the current finding is supported by another study's findings. So in this case, the authors mention Liu and Gao's similar structures as a basis for their own comparison. So maybe 'Similar' is correct here.
