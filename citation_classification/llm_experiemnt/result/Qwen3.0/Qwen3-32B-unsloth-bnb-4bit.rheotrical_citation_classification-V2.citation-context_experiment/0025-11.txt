Okay, let's tackle this citation classification. The task is to determine the rhetorical class of the cited work in the given passage. The options include things like Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, etc. 

Looking at the example provided, the sentence mentions a previous study by Jung et al. which reported that subgroup 16SrV-B was the most divergent lineage. The authors here are presenting a finding from their current study that aligns with this previous report but adds a nuance based on their analysis. 

The phrase "which was previously reported as..." suggests they're referencing Jung et al.'s work to confirm or reinforce their own observation. They're not contrasting their results but pointing out consistency. The citation is used to support their statement by referencing prior research that agrees with their findings. The cited work is presented as evidence that aligns with their own, which fits the Support class. This class is for when the citation backs up a claim made by the authors. 

I don't think it's CoCoRes because they're not comparing conflicting results but rather stating agreement. The Neutral class is out since it's not a passive mention. Motivation doesn't fit as there's no indication of justifying why the research was done. Basis is for foundational work, which isn't the case here. So Support seems correct.
