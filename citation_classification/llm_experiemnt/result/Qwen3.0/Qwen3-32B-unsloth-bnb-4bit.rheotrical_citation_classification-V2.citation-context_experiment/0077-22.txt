Okay, let's look at the passage and figure out what the rhetorical class is for the citation marked as (CITSEG). The text mentions that "This is supported by data from (CITSEG)", which refers to Yvon et al. (2004) or Maier et al. (2013). The authors are using the cited work to back up their claim that ESFY is widespread in wild habitats. They're stating their own findings and then citing previous studies as support. The key phrase here is "supported by data from," which directly indicates that the citation is being used to support their current claim. The cited studies provide evidence that aligns with the authors' own findings about infection rates. This matches the definition of the "Support" class, where the citation is used to confirm or reinforce a claim made by the citing authors.
