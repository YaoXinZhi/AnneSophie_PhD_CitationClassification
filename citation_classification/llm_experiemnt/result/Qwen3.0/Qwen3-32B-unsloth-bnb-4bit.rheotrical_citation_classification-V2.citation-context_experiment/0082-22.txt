Okay, let's analyze this citation step by step. The text mentions that DNA barcoding is used for identifying quarantine and agricultural pests, then cites Hebert and Ratnasingham (2007), Park et al. (2010), and Shin et al. (2013). The context here is explaining that DNA barcoding is a common method in these areas.

Looking at the rhetorical classes, the Basis class is when the cited work is the foundation. But in this case, the citations are supporting the claim that DNA barcoding is used in certain applications. The Support class is for when the citation backs up the authors' claims. The text is stating that DNA barcoding is used for pests, and the citations are examples confirming that usage. They're providing evidence that others have used DNA barcoding similarly, reinforcing the statement made by the authors. 

The CoCo classes involve comparing results or methods with another study, which doesn't seem to fit here. Future, Motivation, and others also don't apply because the citations aren't indicating future work, a knowledge gap, or a similarity. Neutral could be possible if the citations were just mentioned factually without supporting, but in this context, they are given to support the effectiveness or usage of DNA barcoding. 

So the correct class here should be Support.
