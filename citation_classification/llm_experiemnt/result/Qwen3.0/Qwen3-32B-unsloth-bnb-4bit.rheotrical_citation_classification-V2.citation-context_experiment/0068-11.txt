Okay, let me try to figure out the correct rhetoric class for the given citation here. 

Looking at the text, there's a passage discussing the maxillary stylets in different insect groups. The specific citation (CITSEG) is mentioned in the context comparing the dendrite patterns of C. chinensis with those of leafhoppers and planthoppers. The sentence says that the observed two dendrites are "similar to those of other studied Sternorrhyncha except..." and then contrasts this with leafhoppers and planthoppers, citing Foster et al., 1983a,b; Zhao et al., 2010.

So the citation here is being used to compare the research findings with other studies. Specifically, the authors are contrasting their findings (two dendrites) with previous results from different insect groups. Since they're comparing their results to those cited works, the class should be CoCoRes (Comparison of Results). 

I should check if there's another possible class, like Similar or CoCoGM, but the example given in CoCoRes matches this scenario where results are directly compared. The authors are pointing out differences in dendrite patterns between their study and the cited papers. Hence, CoCoRes seems right.
