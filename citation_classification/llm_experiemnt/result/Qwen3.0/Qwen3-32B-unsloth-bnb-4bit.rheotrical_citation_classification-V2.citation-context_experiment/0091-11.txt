Okay, let me try to figure out the rhetorical class for this citation. The sentence mentions Chinese and Taiwanese Cacopsylla chinensis sequences from Lee et al., 2008 forming clusters in NJ trees based on specific gene fragments.

First, I need to see how the citation is used here. The authors are referring to sequences they've included in their analysis. They state that these sequences form well-supported clusters in the NJ trees. The NJ trees are based on the COI-tRNA leu -COII and 16S rDNA gene fragments. 

Looking at the classes, "Usage" refers to when the cited work's method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup is directly used. Here, the sequences from Lee et al. are part of the dataset used in their analysis. The authors are including these sequences in their phylogenetic trees. 

So the citation here isn't for supporting a claim, basing their work on prior research, comparing results, or pointing out similarities. It's more about using the sequences as part of their own analysis. The NJ trees are likely their own work, but the sequences from Lee et al. are part of the data they included. Therefore, this seems like the "Usage" class because they are directly using the sequences (a dataset) from the cited work in their study.
