Okay, let's try to figure out the rhetorical class for the given citation. The passage is about DNA barcoding being a fast method for species identification, especially useful for quarantine and agricultural pests. The citations are from Hebert and Ratnasingham (2007), Park et al. (2010), Shin et al. (2013), and Boehme et al. (2010).

The first part mentions that DNA barcoding is commonly used for pests. The citations here are providing examples of previous studies where DNA barcoding was applied in these areas. The next sentence talks about DNA methods being useful where morphological characters are lacking, citing Boehme et al. 

Looking at the classes, the author is likely using these citations to support the claim that DNA barcoding is a valid and widely used method. Since they reference prior work that has applied DNA barcoding successfully, this seems like "Support" because they're using the cited works to reinforce their own statements about the method's utility. 

"Basis" would be if the cited work is the foundation of their current research, but here it's more about validating the method's common use and effectiveness. "Similar" would require pointing out similarity between the cited work and their own results, but the passage is stating the importance rather than similarity. "CoCo" classes involve comparing or contrasting. "Neutral" is if it's just a descriptive citation without supporting an argument. Let me re-read the examples. 

In the Support example, they cite a study that aligns with their findings. Here, the citations back up the assertion that DNA barcoding is commonly used in these areas, which supports the claim made by the authors about the method's applications. So I think the correct class here is Support.
