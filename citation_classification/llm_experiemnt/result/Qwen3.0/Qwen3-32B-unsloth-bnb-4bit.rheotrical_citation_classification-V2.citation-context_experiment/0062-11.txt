Okay, let's tackle this citation classification problem. First, I need to understand the context where the (CITSEG) is placed. The passage mentions that a certain method has been widely used in DNA barcoding analyses and lists several studies, including the CITSEG. The text then says they used the same methodology to compare results with previous papers despite some limitations noted in other references.

So the CITSEG here is part of a list of studies that have used the method. The authors are referring to prior work that uses the same method, which they are also using. Looking at the rhetorical classes, "Usage" is when the cited work's method is directly used in the current study. The authors mention they used the same methodology as those papers, implying they're following the methods described there. The CITSEG is one of those cited works. Therefore, "Usage" seems appropriate here. They're using the method from CITSEG in their own study. 

Alternatively, could it be "Support"? Well, "Support" is for backing up a claim, but here it's about methodological reference. The key is that the authors are employing the same methodology as described in the cited works. So "Usage" fits better because they're applying the method directly, not just supporting a claim with existing results.
