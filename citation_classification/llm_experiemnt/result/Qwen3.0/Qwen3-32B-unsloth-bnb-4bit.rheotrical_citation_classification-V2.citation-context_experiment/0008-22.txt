Okay, let me try to figure out which rhetorical class to assign here. The citation is in the sentence about psyllid nymphs and adults feeding on plant phloem and occasionally xylem sap (CITSEG). The surrounding text talks about how phytoplasmas impact vector insects important for their distribution, specifically mentioning psyllids. The cited references here are providing information on what psyllids feed on. 

Looking at the classes, "Usage" refers to when the citation refers to a method, tool, etc., but here it's more about their feeding behavior. "Basis" is about foundational work, but the text doesn't say that this is the basis of their research. "Neutral" might be possible because it's just stating a fact from the cited works. Wait, the example for Neutral is giving a neutral descriptive fact, like historical data. Here, the authors are stating that psyllids feed on those saps based on previous studies. Since they are using the cited works to present a factual statement without directly supporting their own claims, contrasting, or motivating further research, this seems neutral. The authors aren't arguing a point here, just reporting what previous studies have shown about psyllid feeding habits. So maybe Neutral is the correct class.
