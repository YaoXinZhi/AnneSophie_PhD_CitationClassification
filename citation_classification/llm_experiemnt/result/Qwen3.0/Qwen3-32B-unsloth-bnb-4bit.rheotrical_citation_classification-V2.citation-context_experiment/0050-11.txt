Okay, let's analyze this citation. The text mentions that the number of protrusions varies among different species and relates this to the hardness of the host plant leaves. They cite Rosell et al., Zhao et al., and Garzo et al. The authors are using these citations to support their own observation about the variation in protrusions linked to host leaf hardness. They're presenting others' findings as evidence that aligns with their own, reinforcing their claim. So the rhetorical class should be Support.
