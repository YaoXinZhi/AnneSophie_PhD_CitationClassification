Okay, let's try to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in the given text. 

First, look at the sentence: "Auxins (IAA and IBA) were shown to induce the recovery of periwinkle plants from 'Ca. P. pruni' and 'Ca. P. asteris' infections (CITSEG) ", illustrating the importance of IAA in plant-pathogen interactions."

So the citation here is supporting the statement that auxins help in recovery, which in turn illustrates their importance. The phrase "illustrating..." shows that the authors are using the cited work to back up their own assertion about IAA's role. The authors aren't comparing their results to the cited work, nor are they pointing out similarities or differences. They're using the citation as evidence to support their claim about the importance of IAA. 

Looking at the classes, "Support" is when the citation confirms a claim. The example given under Support is about a study confirming previous research findings, which matches this case. The cited work here is providing evidence that the authors use to support their own statement. It's not about future work, motivation, basis, or methods. Neutral doesn't fit because it's not just descriptiveâ€”it's reinforcing their point. So the most appropriate label should be "Support".
