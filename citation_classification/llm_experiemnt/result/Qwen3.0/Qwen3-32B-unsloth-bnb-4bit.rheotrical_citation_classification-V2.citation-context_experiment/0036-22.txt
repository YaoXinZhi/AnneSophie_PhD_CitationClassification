Okay, let me try to figure this out. The task is to determine the rhetorical class of the citation (CITSEG) in the given passage. The possible classes are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, or Weakness.

Looking at the passage, the sentence with the citation is: "Apple trees were infected with a virulent accession (3/6, n = 13) in 2017" (CITSEG) [78][79]. The next sentence mentions pear trees infected in 2012 with 'Ca. P. pyri' (PD-W, n = 5) in 2012. 

The citation here seems to be providing information about how apple trees were infected with a specific accession in a certain year. The way it's written, it's describing an experiment setup, a method used to infect the trees. The authors are explaining the procedure they followed. Since the citation refers to a method (inoculation via grafting) that they directly used in their study, this might fall under the Usage class. 

In the Usage definition, it says that the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup from the cited work that is directly used. Here, the authors are detailing how they infected the trees using a method mentioned in the cited works. They aren't comparing results or supporting their claims but rather stating they used the method as described in other studies. That fits Usage better than other categories like Basis or Support. There's no comparison here. Neutral might be if it's just background info but since they're directly using the method, Usage is more accurate.
