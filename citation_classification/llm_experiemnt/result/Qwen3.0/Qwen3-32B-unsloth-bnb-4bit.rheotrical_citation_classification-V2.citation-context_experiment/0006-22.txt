Okay, let's tackle this classification problem. The task is to determine the rhetorical class of the citation at the end here, which is CITSEG pointing to Tedeschi et al. 2002 in the passage provided.

First, I need to look at the context where CITSEG is used. The passage describes the methods used to collect psyllids. It mentions that after collecting insects in the beat-tray, they were collected in glass tubes using a mouth aspirator and then brought to the lab for analysis. The citation here is to Tedeschi et al. 2002. 

The surrounding text is explaining the procedures used in the study. The citation seems to reference a method or procedure detailed in Tedeschi's work that was directly applied here. The mention of using a mouth aspirator and bringing them to the lab for analysis is being cited by Tedeschi et al. This looks like they're following a method outlined in that source. 

Looking at the rhetorical classes, the 'Usage' class refers to when a citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup from the cited work that is directly used in the current study. Here, Tedeschi et al. likely described the method of collecting insects via mouth aspirator into glass tubes, which the current study is applying. 

Is there another possible class? Let's check others. 'Basis' is for intellectual foundation, which might not fit here since the citation is about a specific method rather than the overall foundation. 'Support' would be if the citation backs up a claim the authors make, but in this case, they're just describing their method as following Tedeschi's approach. 'Neutral' would be if it's a general reference without supporting an argument, but Usage is more specific. The context clearly relates to methodology used, so 'Usage' seems correct.
