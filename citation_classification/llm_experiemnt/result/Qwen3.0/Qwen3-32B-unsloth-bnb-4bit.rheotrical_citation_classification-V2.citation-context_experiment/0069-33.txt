Okay, let's try to figure out the rhetorical class for this citation. So the text is talking about pear decline and rootstocks. The first part mentions that the advent of pear decline has reemphasized the importance of rootstocks. Then there's a citation here: CITSEG. The authors mentioned are Blodgett et al., 1963 and Shalla et al., 1963. The next sentence refers to Jensen et al., 1964, but that's after the CITSEG placeholder. Wait, maybe the CITSEG is covering both references mentioned first?

The user instruction says each CITSEG is a single citation, but here the sentence has two citations separated by a semicolon? Wait, the original text has "Blodgett et al., 1963; Shalla et al., 1963" within the CITSEG placeholder. Hmm, maybe the user is combining multiple citations into one CITSEG placeholder? But the example given in the prompt sometimes has multiple citations in the CITSEG placeholder. Wait, looking at the example for 'Basis': "(CITSEG) introduced...", which in the example seems to be a single citation. But sometimes users might have multiple citations grouped under one CITSEG. So perhaps here, the CITSEG includes two references separated by a semicolon. The main point is to determine the rhetorical function of those two citations in the context of the citing text.

The sentence says "The virus-caused disease... that are budded or topgrafted onto certain types of rootstocks type=""bibr"" target=""#b3"">(Blodgett et al., 1963; Shalla et al., 1963</ref)" (CITSEG) "(Jensen et al., 1964)."

Wait, the CITSEG here is followed by Jensen et al., but maybe the CITSEG is the Blodgett and Shalla references. The sentence is using these authors to state that pear decline in certain rootstocks was reported by them. The next part mentions Jensen et al., 1964 as another reference. But the CITSEG in the example includes Blodgett and Shalla. So the role here is that the cited works (Blodgtest et al. and Shalla et al.) are providing a foundation for the current discussion? Because they are establishing that this disease was previously documented in those rootstocks, so they are intellectual foundations. 

Looking at the Basis class example: "(CITSEG) introduced and validated...". In that case, the cited work is foundational. Here, the authors are citing these studies as prior work that established the disease in certain rootstocks, which is part of the basis why rootstocks are important. So Basis would be appropriate here. 

Alternatively, could it be Motivation? If the citation is pointing out a knowledge gap. But in this case, the text is stating that pear decline is important because prior work showed commercial varieties suffer from this when using specific rootstocks, which is more of a basis rather than motivation. Motivation is when the citation identifies a need. Since they are using the prior findings to establish the importance of rootstocks, it's more like Basis. 

Another angle: Neutral? But Neutral is when it's neutral description. Here the authors are using the citations to support the importance of rootstocks, which is more than just a neutral mention. 

Another example in Support class says "support a claim", but here the claim is the reemphasis of rootstocks' importance. The prior works are cited as evidence establishing that this disease exists in those rootstocks, which the authors are building upon. So Basis seems right. CoCoRes is about comparing results, but the authors aren't contrasting results here. CoCoGM would be comparing goals or methods, but again, the text is about prior findings establishing the issue, not comparing methods. So Basis is the most fitting.
