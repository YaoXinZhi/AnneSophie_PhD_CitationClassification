Okay, let's break down this query step by step. The task is to classify the (CITSEG) citation in the given scientific passage into the correct rhetorical class. First, I need to read the surrounding text closely to understand how the cited work is being used.

Looking at the passage, the sentence says: "In direct PCR or the first amplification of semi-nested PCR, the universal phytoplasma primers P1/ P7" (CITSEG) "Schneider et al., 1995 were used." Here, the authors mention that they used specific primers (P1/P7) developed by Schneider et al. in their PCR methods. 

The next reference to Liu et al. (2007a) is about purifying DNA and performing PCR, so I need to distinguish between the two citations. The (CITSEG) points to Schneider et al., who introduced these primers. The citing paper uses those primers in their experiments.

The key here is determining the rhetorical role. The authors are using Schneider's primers directly in their methods. The purpose is to inform the reader where these specific primers came from, as they were developed in a previous study. The citation supports the methodology by referencing the original source of the primers. This seems like a reference to a method/tool, as Liu et al. (2007a) is mentioned in the broader context of PCR methods, but the specific primer citation is (CITSEG). 

However, the Usage class is when a citation refers to a method, tool, dataset used in the current study. Here, the primers are a methodological tool, so citing Schneider et al. because they created those primers. Therefore, the rhetorical class should be 'Usage' since the cited work provides the primers directly used in the current study's PCR procedures.
