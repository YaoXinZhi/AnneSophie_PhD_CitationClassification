Okay, let's tackle this citation classification problem. The task is to determine the rhetorical class of the citation marked as (CITSEG) in the given passage. The classes available are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, Weakness.

Looking at the provided text, the citation (CITSEG) is part of a sentence that says: "repeated by various authors (e.g." followed by the citation Paik 1963 etc. The surrounding context is discussing the first record of a pear psyllid in Korea, C. pyrisuga, mentioned by Shinji in 1944, and then reiterated by other authors. The authors here are citing these works to show that multiple sources have repeated this record.

The Motivation class is used when the citation is used to justify the current research by pointing out a knowledge gap. Neutral is when the citation is just a factual reference without argumentative purpose. In this case, the authors are listing prior works that repeated the initial finding. They're not contrasting results, supporting a claim, or explaining a basis for their research beyond just stating the existing references. It seems like they are providing background information by citing others who have corroborated the initial record.

Since the citation is used to indicate that other authors have repeated the finding, but without necessarily supporting their own argument beyond stating the existing references, Neutral might be appropriate. However, if they are motivating their research by highlighting that there's little known (as mentioned in the opening sentence), then maybe Motivation. But the specific citation here isn't introducing a gap but rather showing prior repetitions. So Neutral seems more accurate here.
