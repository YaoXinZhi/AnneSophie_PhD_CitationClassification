Okay, let's tackle this classification problem step by step. First, I need to look at the context around the citation marked @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. The passage says, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." 

So the main point here is that the current study's results are different from those cited. The author is directly comparing their results to the ones in the cited work. According to the definitions, CoCoRes is when the citation is used to compare results or findings. That seems like the primary class here.

Next, I need to check if there are other possible classes. The example given for CoCoRes matches this scenario exactly, where the results are contrasted. There's no mention of comparing goals or methods (CoCoGM) or explanations between studies (CoCoXY). The context doesn't suggest any support, motivation, or future work either. 

The next possible could be Neutral if there's no clear intent, but since the comparison is explicit, Neutral isn't fitting. The third class might be Basis if the cited work is foundational, but the context here is about differing results, not establishing a foundation. So the top three would be CoCoRes as the primary, maybe followed by CoCoXY if there's a secondary comparison between studies, but looking at the example for CoCoXY, it's when comparing two cited studies with each other, not the citing paper. Here, it's the current work vs. the cited, so CoCoRes is the only clear one. The next could be Neutral if there's no other intent, but I don't see that. Wait, maybe Weakness if the cited work's results are being criticized, but the passage just states a difference, not a flaw. So Weakness isn't right. 

Therefore, the top three are CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral if there's a neutral mention, but the example for Neutral is more about stating a fact without argument. Since the comparison is direct, CoCoRes is first, then maybe Neutral if there's no further intent. But the example for Neutral is different. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe CoCoRes is first, then Basis if the cited work is foundational, but the context is contrasting results, not building on it. So Basis is not applicable. The third could be Neutral as the example where the citation is just stating a fact. So final ranking would be CoCoRes, then Neutral, then maybe CoCoXY if there's a comparison between studies, but no. The example for CoCoXY involves comparing two cited studies, not the current one. So the top three are CoCoRes, then maybe Neutral, then Basis? Wait, no. Let me recheck the definitions. 

The Basis is when the citation is the foundation. Here, the cited work's results are being compared, not serving as a foundation. So Basis isn't right. The third class would be Neutral if there's no other intent. The example for Neutral is "In the USA... @@CITATION@." Here, the citation is stating a difference in results. So Neutral isn't the best fit. Maybe Weakness if the cited work's results are being questioned, but the passage just says they differ, not that they're wrong. So Weakness isn't right. Therefore, the top three are CoCoRes as first, then maybe Neutral as second if there's no further intent, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe there's no second class. Wait, the task requires three classes. Let me think again. The primary is CoCoRes. The next could be CoCoXY if comparing two cited studies, but the example given for CoCoXY involves comparing two studies with each other. Here, the comparison is between the current work and the cited study, so CoCoXY isn't applicable. Then maybe the next is Neutral if the citation is just stating a fact without argument. The example for Neutral is when the citation is used descriptively. Here, the citation is used to compare results, so Neutral isn't the best fit. Wait, maybe Support? No, because Support is when the cited work supports the current findings. Here, the results are different, so Support isn't right. 

Hmm, perhaps the top three are CoCoRes, then maybe Neutral, then Basis. But Basis isn't applicable here. Alternatively, maybe CoCoRes is first, then CoCoXY if there's a comparison between the cited study and others. Wait, the example for CoCoXY is when comparing two cited studies, not the current one. So CoCoXY isn't applicable here. Therefore, the only applicable class is CoCoRes. But the task requires three classes. Maybe Neutral is the second if there's a neutral mention, but I'm not seeing it. Alternatively, maybe the third is Basis if the cited work is foundational, but again, the context is about differing results. Maybe the third is Neutral as the default when there's no clear intent beyond the primary class. So the ranking would be CoCoRes (1), then Neutral (2), then maybe Basis (3), but Basis is not fitting. Alternatively, maybe Weakness is third if the cited work's results are being criticized, but the passage just states a difference. So perhaps Weakness isn't right. Maybe the third is Neutral. So the final answer would be CoCoRes as first, then Neutral, then maybe Basis or another class. Wait, perhaps the third is CoCoGM if there's a comparison of methods, but the context is about results. Hmm. This is tricky. Based on the given example, CoCoRes is clearly the primary class. The next could be Neutral if the citation is just stating a fact without further argument, but the example for Neutral doesn't involve a comparison. Maybe the second and third classes are Neutral and Basis, even if they don't perfectly fit. Alternatively, maybe the second is CoCoXY if there's a comparison between studies, but the example for CoCoXY involves two cited studies. Given that, I'll stick with CoCoRes as first, then maybe Neutral as second, and then Basis as third, even if Basis isn't the best fit. Alternatively, maybe the third is CoCoGM if there's a comparison of goals or methods, but the context doesn't mention that. So the most accurate answer is CoCoRes as first, then Neutral as second, then maybe Basis as third.
