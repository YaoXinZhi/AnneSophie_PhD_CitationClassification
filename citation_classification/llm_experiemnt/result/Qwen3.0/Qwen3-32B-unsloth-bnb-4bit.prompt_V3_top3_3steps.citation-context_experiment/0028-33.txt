Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. First, I need to look at the context around the citation marked @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. The passage says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." 

So the immediate context is about comparing the current results with those from previous experiments using specific deuterium targets. The key phrase here is "substantially differ from the results," which indicates a direct comparison between the current study's findings and the cited work's results. 

Next, according to the task, I need to determine the general intent. Since the citation is used to highlight differences in results between the current work and the cited experiments, this falls under comparative intent. Specifically, comparing results would point towards CoCoRes. 

Looking at the definitions provided, CoCoRes is when the citation is used to compare or contrast results or findings. The example given matches the structure here, where the current results are contrasted with those cited. 

Now, considering other possible classes: Could this be Basis? No, because it's not establishing a foundation. Motivation or Future? Doesn't fit. Support or Similar? The passage states differences, not similarities or support. Weakness? Not a criticism but a factual comparison. Neutral? No, since it's actively comparing results.

Therefore, the primary class is CoCoRes. The secondary might be CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two cited studies, but in this case, the comparison is between the current work and one cited study. However, since the example given in CoCoRes matches this scenario exactly, CoCoRes is the top. 

Looking for the next two classes, perhaps Neutral if there's no other intent, but since the citation is directly used for comparison, Neutral isn't appropriate. Maybe CoCoGM if there's a mention of methods, but the context here is about results. So the top three would be CoCoRes first, then maybe CoCoGM if methods were compared, but since it's results, perhaps Neutral is third. Wait, maybe CoCoXY if comparing explanations between two studies, but the example there involves comparing two cited studies. Here, it's comparing current work to cited results. So CoCoRes is first, then perhaps Neutral if there's no other intent, but maybe the next could be CoCoGM if there's any mention of methods. However, the context mentions "experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets," which refers to methods. So maybe CoCoGM is second. But the main comparison is on results. Hmm.

Wait, the example for CoCoRes says "directly compare or contrast the results or findings." Here, the sentence is comparing results ("results obtained... differ from the results..."), so CoCoRes is definitely first. Then, perhaps Neutral if there's no other intent, but maybe CoCoGM if methods are mentioned. The cited work's methods involve deuterium targets, but the current work's methods aren't specified here. Since the comparison is on results, CoCoRes is primary. The next could be CoCoGM if the methods are compared, but since the passage only mentions the cited methods (deuterium targets) without comparing methods between the current study and the cited one, perhaps CoCoGM isn't applicable. So the second might be Neutral, but Neutral is when there's no specific argument. Alternatively, maybe CoCoXY if comparing explanations between two studies, but here it's comparing current work to cited results. Therefore, the top three are CoCoRes, then maybe Neutral or CoCoGM. Since the cited work's methods are mentioned (deuterium targets), but the comparison is about results, perhaps CoCoGM is not the main intent. So the top three would be CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral as the second, but Neutral isn't fitting here. Alternatively, maybe CoCoGM is second if the methods are compared. Wait, the cited work's methods are mentioned (using deuterium targets), but the current work's methods aren't discussed here. So the comparison is between results, not methods. Therefore, CoCoRes is first, and maybe Neutral is third. But Neutral isn't applicable here because the citation is actively comparing results. Wait, the example for Neutral is when the citation is used descriptively without supporting, comparing, etc. Here, the citation is used to compare results, so Neutral isn't appropriate. Therefore, the top three would be CoCoRes first, then maybe CoCoGM if methods are compared, but since the methods aren't discussed here, perhaps CoCoGM isn't applicable. Therefore, the top three would be CoCoRes, then maybe CoCoXY if comparing explanations between two studies, but again, here it's comparing current work to cited results. So the final answer is CoCoRes first, then perhaps Neutral and CoCoXY as second and third, but Neutral isn't fitting. Hmm. Maybe Neutral isn't right here. Wait, the example for Neutral is when the citation is used descriptively without any specific argument. In this case, the citation is used to compare results, so Neutral isn't appropriate. Therefore, the top three classes are CoCoRes, then maybe CoCoGM and then CoCoXY. But since the methods aren't compared, maybe CoCoGM isn't right. Hmm. This is tricky. Let me recheck the definitions. CoCoGM is comparing goals or methods. The cited work's methods are mentioned (using deuterium targets), but the current study's methods aren't discussed here. The comparison is about results, not methods. So CoCoGM isn't applicable here. Therefore, the top three would be CoCoRes first, then maybe CoCoXY if comparing two cited studies, but in this case, it's comparing the current work to one cited study. So CoCoXY isn't applicable. Therefore, the only applicable class is CoCoRes. But the task requires three classes. Wait, perhaps Neutral is third. Wait, Neutral is when the citation is used descriptively without supporting, comparing, etc. But here, the citation is used to compare results, so Neutral isn't appropriate. Maybe the second and third classes are CoCoXY and Neutral. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the top three are CoCoRes, then maybe CoCoGM if the methods are mentioned, but since the comparison is on results, perhaps CoCoGM isn't the second. Maybe the answer is CoCoRes first, then CoCoXY and Neutral. But I'm not certain. Given the example provided for CoCoRes matches the scenario exactly, I'll stick with CoCoRes as first. The second might be CoCoXY if comparing two cited studies, but in this case, it's comparing current work to cited results. Therefore, maybe the next classes are Neutral and CoCoGM. But since the methods are mentioned (deuterium targets), perhaps CoCoGM is second. However, the comparison is between results, not methods. Therefore, maybe CoCoRes is the only applicable class, but the task requires three. Hmm. Maybe the answer is CoCoRes, then CoCoGM (since methods are mentioned), then Neutral. But the primary intent is comparing results, so CoCoRes is first. CoCoGM would be if the goals or methods are compared. Since the cited work's methods are mentioned (using deuterium targets), but the current study's methods aren't discussed here, maybe CoCoGM isn't applicable. Therefore, the top three classes are CoCoRes, then maybe Neutral and then CoCoXY. But Neutral isn't fitting here. This is confusing. Given the example provided in the task, the correct answer is CoCoRes first. The other two might be Neutral and CoCoXY, but I'm not sure. Given the strict example, I'll go with CoCoRes as first, then Neutral and CoCoXY as second and third, even if uncertain.
