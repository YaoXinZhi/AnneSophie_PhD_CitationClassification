Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand the task properly. The user wants me to classify the citation marked @@CITATION@@ in the given passage into the top three rhetorical classes from the predefined list. The classes include things like Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, etc. 

Looking at the passage provided, the sentence around the citation is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." 

So, step one is to extract the context. The key part here is comparing the results of the current work with those from the cited study. The phrase "substantially differ from the results" indicates a direct comparison of findings.

Next, identifying the general intent. The citation is used to contrast results, which falls under the Comparative category. According to the definitions, CoCoRes is for comparing results or findings of the cited work with the citing paper. That seems to fit perfectly here because the sentence is directly contrasting their results with those of the cited experiments.

Now, checking if there's a secondary intent. The example given for CoCoRes matches the structure here. The authors are pointing out differences in results. There's no mention of comparing goals or methods (CoCoGM) or explanations between studies (CoCoXY). The citation isn't supporting their own findings (Support) or motivating the research (Motivation). 

However, maybe there's a neutral aspect? The Neutral class is for when the citation is just descriptive. But in this case, the comparison is active, not neutral. The example for Neutral given doesn't involve a comparison, just stating facts. So Neutral isn't the main class here. 

Is there a possibility of another class? Let's see. The primary is definitely CoCoRes. The secondary could be CoCoXY if they were comparing explanations, but the sentence is about results. The example for CoCoXY involves conflicting results between two cited studies, not between the current work and a cited one. So CoCoXY isn't applicable here. 

The third class might be Basis if the cited work is foundational, but the context is about differing results, not establishing a foundation. So Basis is out. Similarly, Weakness would be if they're criticizing the cited work, but the sentence is about differing results, not pointing out flaws. 

So the top three would be CoCoRes as the primary. Then perhaps Neutral as a secondary if there's any descriptive element, but the main intent is comparative. Wait, maybe there's another angle. Let me check again. The example for CoCoRes is when results are compared directly. The sentence here does that. The third class could be something else, but I don't see another clear fit. The example given for Neutral is just stating a fact without argument, but here the comparison is active. 

Hmm. Maybe the third is Neutral if there's a neutral description alongside the comparison. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe there's a Basis aspect if the cited work is part of the foundation. However, the context is contrasting results, not building on it. 

So the top three are CoCoRes first. Then maybe CoCoXY if there's any comparison between studies, but the example for CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies. Here, it's comparing their results with the cited one. So CoCoXY doesn't fit. 

Wait, the example for CoCoRes says "comparison or contrast," so CoCoRes is the correct class here. Then, perhaps the third could be Neutral if the rest of the sentence is neutral. But I think Neutral isn't applicable here. 

Alternatively, maybe Future or Motivation? No, the sentence isn't about future work or motivation. 

So the top three classes are CoCoRes as the primary, then maybe Neutral as the third if there's a neutral part, but I'm not certain. Wait, the example for Neutral is when the citation is just descriptive. Here, the citation is part of a comparison, so Neutral might not apply. 

Therefore, the primary is CoCoRes. The secondary and tertiary might be CoCoXY and Neutral, but given the example, CoCoXY is for comparing two cited studies, not the current one. So perhaps Neutral is the third. But I'm not sure. Maybe there's no second or third here. Wait, the user wants exactly three classes ranked. 

Wait, maybe the example given for CoCoRes is the primary, then perhaps Support if they're supporting their claim by contrasting, but Support is when they confirm their findings. Hmm. 

Alternatively, maybe the third is Basis if the cited work is part of the foundation for their comparison. But again, the context is contrasting results, not building on the foundation. 

This is a bit tricky, but based on the definitions and examples provided, CoCoRes is definitely the top class. The second could be CoCoXY if there's a comparison between studies, but in this case, it's between the current work and the cited one. So perhaps CoCoXY isn't applicable. 

Wait, the example for CoCoXY says "compare or contrast two cited studies with each other â€” not with the citing paper." Here, the comparison is between the current work and the cited study, so CoCoRes is correct. Therefore, the top three would be CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral as a third, but Neutral doesn't fit. Maybe the other two are CoCoGM or something else. 

Alternatively, maybe there's no second or third. But the task requires three. Perhaps the second is CoCoGM if there's a method comparison. The sentence mentions "experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets," which could imply a method difference. So maybe CoCoGM is secondary. 

Wait, CoCoGM is for comparing goals or methods. The sentence here is comparing results, but if the methods are different (using deuterium targets), maybe that's part of the comparison. But the primary comparison is results. Hmm. 

This is getting complicated. Given the example for CoCoRes, the primary is definitely CoCoRes. The second could be CoCoGM if the methods are compared. Let me re-examine the sentence: "The results... differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium..." So the cited experiments used deuterium targets, and the current work's results differ. The comparison is about results, but the methods might be different. However, the example for CoCoRes focuses on results. So maybe CoCoRes is first, CoCoGM second if methods are compared. 

Alternatively, maybe CoCoRes is first, then Neutral as third. But Neutral is when it's just descriptive. 

I think based on the strict example given, CoCoRes is the primary. The second might be CoCoGM if the methods are part of the comparison. The third could be Neutral. 

But I'm not entirely sure. Given the example for CoCoRes is a direct comparison of results, I'll stick with CoCoRes as first. Then perhaps CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two cited studies, but in this case, only one study is cited. 

Hmm. Maybe the third is Neutral. But Neutral is when the citation is neutral. Since the sentence is contrasting results, Neutral isn't appropriate. 

Therefore, the top three are CoCoRes as first. The second and third might be other classes, but I'm not certain. Wait, the user's example output shows CoCoRes as first. So maybe in this case, CoCoRes is the primary, and perhaps Neutral is third if there's a neutral part. But I'm not sure. 

After careful consideration, I'll conclude that CoCoRes is the primary class. The second could be CoCoGM if there's a method comparison, but the example focuses on results. Therefore, CoCoRes is the top, and maybe Neutral as third if there's any neutral description. However, given the context is contrasting results, Neutral isn't the best fit. 

So, the final answer is CoCoRes as first, then maybe CoCoXY and Neutral as second and third, but based on the example, CoCoRes is the only applicable one. Wait, but the task requires three classes. Maybe there's another angle. 

Wait, perhaps the citation is also supporting their claim that their results differ, so Support? No, Support is when they confirm their findings. 

I think I'm overcomplicating this. Based on the given example and the context, the correct primary class is CoCoRes. The other two might be CoCoXY and Neutral, but given the example, CoCoRes is the only clear one. However, the task requires three, so perhaps the user expects CoCoRes first, then maybe CoCoXY and Neutral as the next two, even if they're not the best fit. 

Alternatively, maybe the user expects CoCoRes as first, then CoCoGM as second if methods are compared, and Neutral as third. But I'm not confident. 

In conclusion, based on the strict example provided, the top three classes are CoCoRes as first. The next two might be CoCoXY and Neutral, but given the example for CoCoXY involves comparing two cited studies, which isn't the case here. Therefore, perhaps the second is CoCoGM and third is Neutral. 

But I'm not sure. Given the ambiguity, I'll proceed with CoCoRes as the primary, then maybe CoCoGM as secondary if methods are implied, and Neutral as third.
