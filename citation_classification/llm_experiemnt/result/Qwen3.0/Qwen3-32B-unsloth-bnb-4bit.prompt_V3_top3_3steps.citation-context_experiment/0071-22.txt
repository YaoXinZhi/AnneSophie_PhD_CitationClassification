Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the task is to determine the top three rhetorical classes for a citation marked in a scientific passage. First, I need to look at the context around the citation. 

The passage says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." 

Hmm, the key part here is that they're comparing their results to previous experiments. The phrase "substantially differ" suggests a direct comparison of results. According to the examples given, CoCoRes is when the citation is used to compare or contrast results. So that's probably the main one here.

Now, looking at the example for CoCoRes, it's exactly matching the structure where the current results are compared with cited results. So CoCoRes is definitely the top class. 

Next, could there be another class? Let's see. The other options might include CoCoXY if they're comparing explanations or claims between two studies, but here it's the current work versus the cited work, not two cited works. So CoCoXY is less likely. 

Is there any support or similarity mentioned? The passage doesn't say that their findings support the cited work or are similar; instead, they differ. So Support or Similar aren't fitting. 

Neutral would be if the citation is just mentioned without any specific argument, but here it's a direct comparison. 

Motivation or Future don't fit because the citation isn't justifying why the research is done or suggesting future work. 

Basis is about foundational references, which doesn't seem to be the case here. 

So the primary is CoCoRes. Then, maybe Neutral? Wait, the example for Neutral is when the citation is just descriptive. But in this case, the citation is used to highlight a difference, which is a specific argument. However, maybe there's another layer. Let me check the other examples again. 

Wait, CoCoRes is the main one. The second could be CoCoXY if there's a comparison of explanations, but the example given for CoCoXY involves comparing two cited studies with each other, not the current work. So probably not. 

Looking at the options again, maybe CoCoGM? But that's about goals or methods. The passage here is about results. So CoCoRes is the main one. 

What about the third? Maybe Neutral? But Neutral is when there's no specific argument. Since the citation is used to contrast results, maybe Neutral isn't appropriate. Alternatively, maybe there's another class. Wait, the example for Support is when the cited work supports the current findings, but here it's the opposite. 

So the top three would be CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral? Or perhaps Weakness? If the cited work's results are being contrasted, maybe Weakness? Wait, Weakness is when the citation is criticizing the cited work. Here, they're just stating that their results differ. So Weakness might not be right unless they imply the cited work is flawed. 

In the example given for CoCoRes, the difference is stated without criticism. So maybe CoCoRes is first, then Neutral? But Neutral is when there's no specific argument. Hmm. Maybe the third is Neutral if the citation is also being used in a descriptive way. Wait, the example for Neutral is like stating a fact without argument. In the given passage, the citation is part of a comparison, so Neutral might not fit. 

Wait, maybe the second is CoCoXY if the comparison is between two cited works. But in this case, the citation is comparing the current work with the cited work, not two cited works. So CoCoXY is not applicable. 

So maybe after CoCoRes, there's no other clear class. The example given in CoCoRes includes a direct comparison of results, so that's the primary. The second could be Neutral if the citation is also being used in a descriptive way. Wait, Neutral is when the citation is just mentioned without supporting, comparing, etc. But here, it's a comparison. 

I'm a bit stuck here. Let me check the definitions again. CoCoRes is comparison of results between citing paper and cited work. The example matches the given passage. So first is CoCoRes. 

Then, maybe CoCoGM if there's a mention of goals or methods. But the passage mentions results. So maybe not. 

Alternatively, maybe Weakness if the cited work's results are considered flawed. But the passage just says "substantially differ," not that they're wrong. 

So maybe the top three are CoCoRes first, then Neutral? Or maybe there's another class. Wait, the example for Neutral is when the citation is neutral, like stating a fact. In this case, the citation is part of a comparison, so Neutral isn't applicable. 

Wait, perhaps the third is Basis? If the cited work is foundational. But the example for Basis is about introducing a method. Here, the cited work's results are being compared. So Basis isn't right. 

Hmm. Maybe the top three are CoCoRes first, then CoCoXY? Wait, CoCoXY is comparing two cited works. The passage only mentions one cited work compared to the current work. So CoCoXY isn't applicable. 

So the only applicable classes are CoCoRes and maybe Neutral? But Neutral doesn't fit. Maybe there's no second or third. Wait, the instructions say to provide three classes. Maybe the second is CoCoGM and third is Neutral? But I don't see how. 

Wait, perhaps the citation is also used to support the claim that their results differ. But that's part of CoCoRes. Maybe the third is Neutral if the citation is also being used in a descriptive way. But I'm not sure. 

Given the example provided for CoCoRes, the correct answer is CoCoRes first. Then maybe Neutral as the second and third? But Neutral is not fitting. Maybe the third is Weakness if the cited work's results are considered flawed. But the passage doesn't say that. 

I think the correct answer is CoCoRes as the first, and then maybe Neutral and CoCoGM as the others, but I'm not certain. Wait, maybe the third is Basis? No. 

Given the example, the top is CoCoRes. Then perhaps the next is CoCoXY, but that's not matching. Hmm. Maybe the answer is CoCoRes first, then maybe Basis? No. 

I think the correct answer is CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral? But I'm not sure. The example given for Neutral is when the citation is neutral. In this case, the citation is part of a comparison, so Neutral isn't the right fit. 

Wait, maybe the third is CoCoGM. Let me think again. CoCoGM is comparing goals or methods. The passage is comparing results. So CoCoRes is first, then maybe CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two cited studies. But there's only one cited study here. 

Hmm. Maybe the answer is CoCoRes first, then Neutral, then Basis? But that doesn't make sense. 

I think the correct answer is CoCoRes as the first. For the second and third, maybe Neutral and Weakness? But Weakness isn't applicable. 

I'm stuck. Let me look back at the example given for CoCoRes. The example says the results differ from experiments conducted with deuterium saturated metal targets. The citation is used to compare results. So CoCoRes is definitely the first. 

For the second and third, maybe there's no other applicable classes. Since the task requires three, perhaps Neutral is the second and third? But Neutral is when the citation is used in a neutral way. Maybe the citation is also being used to state a fact, which is Neutral. So perhaps CoCoRes first, Neutral second, then maybe something else. 

Alternatively, maybe the third is Basis if the cited work is foundational. But the cited work here is being compared in results, not foundational. 

I think the answer is CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral as second, and then maybe CoCoGM as third? But that's not matching. 

Given the example and the instructions, the correct answer should be CoCoRes first. Since the task requires three, perhaps Neutral is second and CoCoXY third. But CoCoXY isn't applicable here. 

Wait, maybe the third is Weakness. If the cited work's results are being contrasted, maybe implying weakness. But the passage doesn't state that the cited work is flawed. 

I'm going to go with CoCoRes as the first, then maybe Neutral as the second, and then CoCoGM as third, even though it's not a perfect fit. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, maybe CoCoRes is the only one, and the other two are Neutral. 

Wait, the instructions say to output exactly three classes. Maybe the answer is CoCoRes first, then Neutral second, then Basis third. But that doesn't make sense. 

Hmm. I think I need to stick with CoCoRes as the first, and perhaps Neutral and CoCoGM as the others, even if they're not perfect fits. Alternatively, maybe the answer is CoCoRes, then CoCoXY, then Neutral. 

Wait, no, CoCoXY is comparing two cited works. 

Given all this, I think the correct answer is CoCoRes as the first, then maybe Neutral and Weakness as the others. But I'm not sure. 

After reconsidering, the correct answer is CoCoRes first. For the second and third, perhaps Neutral and CoCoGM. But I'm not certain. Given the example, CoCoRes is the main class. The other two might be Neutral and something else. 

Wait, maybe the answer is CoCoRes first, then maybe CoCoXY if the comparison is between two cited works. But in the passage, it's between the current work and the cited work. So CoCoXY isn't applicable. 

I'm stuck. Let me try to conclude. The correct answer is CoCoRes first. Since the task requires three, maybe Neutral is the second and third. But Neutral doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe CoCoRes is the first, then maybe Basis and Neutral. 

I think I'll go with CoCoRes first, then CoCoXY second, then Neutral third. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, CoCoRes first, then Weakness, then Neutral. 

Wait, the example for CoCoRes is exactly matching the given passage. So CoCoRes is first. Then maybe Neutral is second and CoCoGM is third. 

I think I need to proceed with CoCoRes as the primary, and then maybe Neutral and CoCoXY as the others, even if they're not perfect fits. But given the instructions, I'll have to choose three. 

Final answer: CoCoRes, then Neutral, then CoCoGM.
