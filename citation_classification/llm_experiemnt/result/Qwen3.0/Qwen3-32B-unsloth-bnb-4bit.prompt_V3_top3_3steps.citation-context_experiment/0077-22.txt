Okay, let's tackle this classification task. First, I need to look at the context around the citation marked @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. The passage says, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." 

So the main point here is that the current study's results are different from those cited. Comparing results directly is a key aspect here. According to the definitions, CoCoRes is used when comparing results of cited work with the current paper. That seems like the primary class here.

Next, I need to check if there's a secondary or tertiary classification. The example given for CoCoRes matches this scenario exactly, where the present results are contrasted with previous ones. There's no mention of comparing methods or goals, nor is there any support or motivation here. The citation isn't being used to support the current findings but to highlight a difference. 

Looking at Neutral, which is for descriptive use without argumentation, this doesn't fit because the citation is actively contrasting results. Weakness would involve criticism, which isn't present here either. The comparison is about results differing, not about flaws. 

So the top class is definitely CoCoRes. Then, maybe Neutral if there's a slight descriptive element, but since the comparison is direct, Neutral isn't the best fit. The third could be Basis if the cited work is foundational, but there's no indication of that here. The main intent is comparison of results. Therefore, the top three would be CoCoRes first, then maybe CoCoXY if comparing explanations, but the example for CoCoXY involves comparing two cited studies with each other, not the cited with the current work. Hence, CoCoXY isn't applicable here. 

So the top three are CoCoRes, then perhaps Neutral if there's any descriptive element, but I think Neutral isn't right. Maybe the next would be CoCoGM if there's a mention of goals or methods, but the passage is about results. So the only applicable is CoCoRes. Wait, but the instructions say to list three. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again.

The passage says the results differ from experiments using deuterium targets cited. That's a direct comparison of results, so CoCoRes is first. Then perhaps CoCoGM if there's any method comparison, but the example mentions methods. The cited work's experiments used different targets, which could relate to methods. However, the comparison here is about results, not methods. So maybe CoCoRes is the only primary. The example given for CoCoRes matches exactly. Then, maybe Neutral as a third if there's no other intent, but Neutral is when the citation is just descriptive. Since the citation is used to contrast results, Neutral isn't appropriate. Maybe Weakness if the cited results are considered problematic, but the passage doesn't state that. The cited results are just different, not flawed. Therefore, the top three classes would be CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral as a stretch, but perhaps there's another class. Wait, maybe there's no third class applicable here. But the task requires three. Hmm. Maybe the example given in the problem is similar to the CoCoRes example, so the first is CoCoRes. The second could be CoCoXY if comparing explanations, but the example for CoCoXY involves comparing two cited studies. Here, it's comparing cited with current. So CoCoXY isn't applicable. Then maybe the third is Neutral. But Neutral is when the citation is just descriptive. Since the citation here is used to contrast results, Neutral isn't right. Maybe the third is Basis if the cited work is foundational, but the example for Basis is about introducing a method. Here, the cited work's experiments are being compared in results, not foundational. So perhaps the only valid class is CoCoRes, but the task requires three. Maybe the user expects CoCoRes, then Neutral, then maybe another. Wait, perhaps there's no other applicable classes here. Maybe the answer is CoCoRes as first, then Neutral as second, then maybe Basis as third if forced. But that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the user expects CoCoRes first, then CoCoGM if the methods are different. Wait, the cited experiments used different targets (deuterium saturated metal targets), which could relate to methods. So comparing methods could be CoCoGM. But the passage states the results differ, not the methods. So CoCoGM would be if the methods were compared. Since the comparison is about results, CoCoRes is primary. The second could be CoCoGM if the methods are different, but the passage doesn't state that. Therefore, the second might be Neutral. Hmm. Maybe the answer is CoCoRes first, then Neutral, then maybe another. But Neutral doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe there are only two applicable classes, but the task requires three. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's stick to the example provided. The example given for CoCoRes is exactly matching the passage's structure. So the first is CoCoRes. The second could be CoCoXY if comparing two studies, but here it's comparing cited with current. Third might be Neutral. But Neutral is when the citation is descriptive without argument. Since the citation is used to contrast results, Neutral isn't right. Maybe the third is Basis, but again, not applicable. Hmm. Maybe the answer is CoCoRes first, then maybe CoCoGM if the methods are different. Wait, the cited experiments used different targets, which could be part of methods. So comparing methods would be CoCoGM. But the passage is about results differing. So perhaps CoCoRes is first, then CoCoGM as second if the methods are different, but the passage doesn't explicitly state that the methods are different, just the targets. Maybe the methods are part of the cited study's setup. Therefore, comparing results is CoCoRes, comparing methods is CoCoGM. But the passage doesn't mention methods, just results. Therefore, CoCoRes is the primary. Then maybe CoCoXY isn't applicable. So perhaps the second is Neutral, third is Basis. But Neutral isn't right. Maybe the correct answer is CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral as second, then another. But I'm not sure. Given the example in the problem matches CoCoRes exactly, I'll go with CoCoRes as first. Then maybe Neutral as second if forced, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps there's no second class applicable. But the task requires three. Maybe the answer is CoCoRes, then Neutral, then Basis. But Neutral doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the answer is CoCoRes first, then CoCoXY, then Neutral. But CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies, which isn't the case here. Hmm. Maybe the answer is CoCoRes first, then maybe CoCoGM as second if the methods are different. Let me think again. The cited experiments used different targets (deuterium saturated metal targets), which could be part of their methods. If the current study's methods didn't use those targets, then comparing methods would be CoCoGM. But the passage doesn't state that. The passage says results differ. Therefore, CoCoRes is first. The second could be CoCoGM if the methods are different. Since the cited study used different targets, which is part of their experimental setup (methods), comparing methods would be CoCoGM. So perhaps CoCoRes and CoCoGM are both applicable. Then third might be Neutral. But the passage doesn't mention methods directly. Hmm. Maybe the answer is CoCoRes first, then CoCoGM second, then Neutral third. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe only CoCoRes is applicable. Given the ambiguity, I'll proceed with CoCoRes as first, then CoCoGM as second, then Neutral third.
