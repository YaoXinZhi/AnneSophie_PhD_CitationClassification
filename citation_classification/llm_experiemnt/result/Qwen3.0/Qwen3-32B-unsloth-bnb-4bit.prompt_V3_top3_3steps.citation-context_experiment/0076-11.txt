Okay, let's see. I need to classify the citation marked @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. First, I'll extract the context around it.

The passage says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." 

So the context is about comparing the current study's results with those from another study that used different metal targets. The key phrase here is "substantially differ," which indicates a direct comparison of results. 

Next, the general intent is to contrast findings, which falls under Comparative. Looking at the specific rhetorical classes, CoCoRes is for comparing results. The example given for CoCoRes matches this scenario where results are directly compared. 

Are there other possible classes? Maybe CoCoXY if comparing explanations, but the example here is about results, not explanations or claims between two cited studies. The cited work here is compared with the current paper's results, so CoCoRes is the best fit. 

Is there a secondary intent? The mention of different experimental setups (deuterium saturated targets) might hint at CoCoGM (comparison of methods), but the primary focus is on the results. Neutral could be a stretch if it was just stating facts, but the comparison is explicit. 

So the top three would be CoCoRes first, then maybe CoCoGM as a secondary, and Neutral if there's any descriptive element. But the example given for CoCoRes is almost identical to the passage here. So I think CoCoRes is the primary, then perhaps Neutral if there's a neutral comparison, but the example for Neutral is more about stating facts without argument. The passage is making a direct comparison of results, so CoCoRes is definitely first. The others might be CoCoXY if comparing two studies, but since it's comparing the current work to the cited one, it's CoCoRes. Maybe CoCoGM if the methods are different, but the example given for CoCoRes is a better fit. So the top three are CoCoRes, then maybe CoCoGM as a secondary, and Neutral as third. Wait, but the example for CoCoRes is exactly this scenario. So the answer should be CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral or another. Hmm. The example for CoCoRes is "results obtained... differ from... experiments... CITATION". So that's exactly CoCoRes. So first is CoCoRes. Then, maybe Neutral if there's no further argument. But the passage is making a point about differing results, so maybe CoCoRes is the only one. But the task says top three. Maybe the others are Neutral and CoCoGM. Let me check the definitions again. CoCoGM is comparison of goals or methods. Here, the comparison is about results, so CoCoRes is correct. The other classes might not apply. Neutral is when it's descriptive without argument. But the passage is contrasting results, so Neutral isn't right. So maybe CoCoRes is first, then perhaps Weakness if the cited work's results are being contrasted as a limitation, but the example for Weakness is about criticizing the cited work. Here, it's just stating differences. So Weakness might not apply. So the top three would be CoCoRes, then maybe CoCoXY if comparing two studies, but the example for CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies with each other, not with the current paper. So CoCoXY isn't right here. Therefore, the top three are CoCoRes, then maybe Neutral if there's any descriptive aspect, but the passage is making a direct comparison. Hmm. Maybe the answer is CoCoRes as first, then perhaps Neutral and Basis. Wait, Basis is foundational. The cited work here isn't providing the foundation but is being compared. So Basis is not applicable. The correct top three are CoCoRes, then maybe CoCoGM if methods are compared, but the passage mentions the results differing. So the answer is CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral and another. Wait, perhaps Neutral isn't applicable here. Maybe CoCoRes is the only one, but the task requires three. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me recheck. The passage says the current results differ from those experiments cited. That's a direct comparison of results (CoCoRes). The other possible classes might be CoCoGM if the methods are compared, but the example given for CoCoRes matches this scenario. So CoCoRes is first. Then maybe CoCoXY if comparing two cited studies, but here it's current vs cited. So maybe CoCoXY isn't applicable. The third could be Neutral if the citation is just stating a fact. But Neutral is when it's used neutrally without argument. The passage is contrasting results, so Neutral isn't right. Maybe Weakness if the cited work's results are considered flawed, but the passage doesn't criticize them, just states they differ. So Weakness isn't right. Therefore, the top three are CoCoRes, then maybe Neutral and another. But perhaps there's only one applicable class. Wait, the task says to pick top three even if fewer are applicable. Maybe CoCoRes is first, then Neutral and another. Alternatively, maybe the answer is CoCoRes, then CoCoGM if methods are mentioned. The cited experiments used different targets (TiD, TaD, etc.), so maybe comparing methods. So CoCoGM could be second. Then Neutral as third. But the primary comparison is results. So the ranking would be CoCoRes first, CoCoGM second, Neutral third. But the example for CoCoRes is exactly this case. Hmm. Let me stick with CoCoRes as first, CoCoGM as second, and Neutral third.
