Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the citation @@CITATION@@ in the provided passage. The example given mentions a comparison between two phytoplasma strains in daisy plants and conflicting results in another study. The citation here is used to highlight conflicting findings between two studies.

Next, determining the general intent. The example is pointing out conflicting results between the cited study and another, which suggests a comparative analysis of explanations or claims. That fits under CoCoXY since it's comparing two cited studies rather than the citing paper itself.

Now, ranking the top three rhetorical classes. The primary intent here is CoCoXY because the citation contrasts two studies. There's also an element of CoCoRes if the results are being compared directly, but the example specifically mentions conflicting results in different studies, which aligns more with CoCoXY. Neutral might be a lower rank if there's no strong argumentative stance, but the mention of conflicting results implies some analysis, so Neutral might not be the best fit. The third could be CoCoRes or maybe Support, but given the example, CoCoXY is first, then perhaps CoCoRes and then Neutral.
