Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the authors used a method previously described by @@CITATION@@. The sentence is: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." 

Next, determining the general intent. The citation here is referring to a method that's being used in the current study. The key words are "experimental set-up was described in detail previously," which indicates that the cited work provided the method or setup that the current study is employing.

Looking at the predefined classes, "Usage" seems appropriate because the citation is about using a method from the cited paper. The example given for Usage mentions an experimental set-up being described previously, which matches this case. 

Is there any other possible class? Maybe "Support" if they're confirming previous results, but the sentence doesn't mention supporting findingsâ€”it's about using a method. "Basis" could be considered if it's foundational, but the example for Basis talks about introducing a concept, not just using a method. 

So the primary class is definitely Usage. Now, secondary classes. If there's a comparison, maybe CoCoGM or CoCoRes, but the sentence doesn't compare goals or results. The context is straightforward usage. Neutral might be possible if it's just a descriptive mention without supporting or criticizing, but the example for Neutral is more about stating facts without any argument. However, in this case, the citation is directly about using a method, which aligns with Usage as the top class. 

Looking at the examples again, the Usage example is almost identical: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@." So Usage is the top. 

For the second and third, maybe Neutral if there's no other intent. Since the citation isn't supporting a claim or comparing, Neutral could be secondary. But wait, maybe "Support"? The example for Support mentions consistency with previous research, which isn't the case here. So Neutral might be more accurate here. 

So top three would be Usage, Neutral, maybe Basis? Wait, Basis is about intellectual foundation. If the method is foundational, perhaps Basis could be secondary. But the example for Basis is about introducing a concept, not just describing a setup. The passage here is more about using an existing method rather than establishing a foundation. So maybe Basis isn't right. 

So the top three are Usage, Neutral, and perhaps Support if there's any implication of confirming the setup's validity. But the sentence is about using the setup, not supporting a result. Therefore, Neutral would be second, and maybe Basis third if applicable, but I think Basis is less likely here. 

Finalizing: 1. Usage, 2. Neutral, 3. Support? Wait, Support requires that the cited work supports the current findings. Since the current study is using the setup from the cited work, maybe Support isn't correct. Neutral is more accurate as the third. But the example for Neutral is about stating facts without argument. 

I think the correct top three are Usage, Neutral, and maybe Basis if the setup is foundational. But given the examples, Usage is the primary, Neutral as secondary, and perhaps CoCoXY if there's a comparison between studies, but there isn't here. 

Therefore, the top three are Usage, Neutral, and Basis. Wait, Basis is for intellectual foundation. If the cited work's setup is the basis for the current study's methodology, then Basis could be second. But the example for Basis is about introducing a concept. 

Hmm. This is tricky. Let me recheck the definitions. Usage is when referring to a method, tool, dataset used. That's clearly the case here. Neutral is when cited in a descriptive way without supporting or motivating. Since the citation here is just stating that the setup was described previously, it's descriptive. So Neutral could be second. 

Is there a third? Maybe Support if the cited setup supports their current setup. But Support requires that the cited work supports the citing authors' work. If they're using the setup from the cited work, maybe Support is applicable because they're confirming that their setup is as described. But the example for Support is about consistency with previous research. 

Alternatively, maybe Basis is third if the cited work is the foundation. The example for Basis is about introducing a method. If the cited work introduced the setup, then Basis would be appropriate. 

So the top three could be Usage, Basis, Neutral. But I'm not sure. Wait, the example for Usage is exactly matching the current case. So Usage is definitely first. Then, if the cited work is the basis for the current study's setup, Basis is second. Neutral could be third if there's no other intent. 

But the example for Basis mentions introducing and validating a method, which is similar to this case. So maybe Basis is second. Neutral is third. 

Alternatively, maybe CoCoGM if comparing methods, but there's no comparison here. 

So finalizing:

1. Usage  
2. Basis  
3. Neutral

1. Usage  
2. Basis  
3. Neutral
