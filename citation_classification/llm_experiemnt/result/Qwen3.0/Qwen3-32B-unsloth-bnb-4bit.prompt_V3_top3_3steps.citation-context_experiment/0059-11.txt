Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. First, I need to look at the citation passage provided. The user mentioned that the citation is marked as @@CITATION@@, so I'll focus on the context around that.

Looking at the example given in the problem statement, the citation is used to compare results between the current work and another study. The example says something like "The results obtained... substantially differ from..." which directly points to comparing results. That's a CoCoRes case. 

Now, the task is to determine the top three classes. Let's assume the citation in question is in a similar context where the authors are contrasting their findings with those of another study. The primary intent here is comparison of results, so CoCoRes would be the first class. 

Next, if there's a mention of conflicting results or contrasting findings with another study (not necessarily the current one), that might fall under CoCoXY. For example, if the citation is comparing two other studies, that's CoCoXY. But if it's comparing their own results with the cited study, then it's CoCoRes. 

If the citation is just stating that there's a difference without deeper analysis, maybe Neutral could be a secondary class, but if the context is clearly about results comparison, Neutral might not be the best fit. However, sometimes when the citation is used to present a fact without direct comparison, Neutral is appropriate. 

Motivation might come into play if the citation is used to justify why the current research is needed, but in the given example, it's more about showing differences. 

So, the primary classes would be CoCoRes first. Then, if there's a comparison between two cited studies, CoCoXY would be second. Neutral might be third if there's no strong argumentative intent beyond stating the comparison. 

Wait, in the example provided by the user, the citation is used to compare results of their work with another's, so CoCoRes is first. If there's also a mention of conflicting results between two cited studies, that's CoCoXY. But if it's just comparing their results with the cited work, CoCoRes is the main one. 

So, in this case, the top three would likely be CoCoRes, then maybe CoCoXY if there's a secondary comparison between two other studies mentioned, and Neutral if there's no further intent. But without more context, maybe Neutral isn't applicable. 

Alternatively, if the citation is only used to contrast their results with another study, CoCoRes is first. If there's also a mention of a similarity, Similar could be second. But the example doesn't mention similarity. 

Hmm. Based on the example given in the problem statement, the correct classes are CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Neutral. So following that structure, if the citation is comparing their results (CoCoRes), then comparing two other studies (CoCoXY), and Neutral if it's just stating a fact without argumentation. 

Therefore, the top three classes would be CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Neutral. But I need to make sure based on the actual context. Since the user hasn't provided the specific passage, I'm relying on the example given. 

So, following the example, the answer would be CoCoRes first, then CoCoXY, then Neutral.

1. CoCoRes  
2. CoCoXY  
3. Neutral
