Okay, let's tackle this classification problem step by step. First, I need to understand the context around the citation marked @@CITATION@@. The passage says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." 

So, the key part here is the comparison between the current study's results and those from the cited work. The phrase "substantially differ" indicates that they are contrasting their findings with the previous experiments. 

Next, looking at the general intent, this seems like a direct comparison of results. The authors are pointing out differences in outcomes between their work and the cited study. That aligns with the CoCoRes category, which is about comparing results. 

Now, considering other possible classes. There's a mention of different experiments, so maybe CoCoGM if it were about methods or goals, but the example given for CoCoRes is almost identical to this case. The example states comparing results directly, which matches here. 

Is there any other intent? The citation isn't used to support the current findings (Support), nor is it to show similarity (Similar). It's not a basis for their work, nor is it a criticism (Weakness). So the primary class here is CoCoRes. 

For the secondary classes, maybe Neutral if there's no strong intent beyond comparison, but since they are directly contrasting results, Neutral might not fit. CoCoXY is about comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies, which isn't the case here. So the top three would be CoCoRes first, then maybe CoCoGM if there's any method comparison, but the example given here is purely about results. 

Wait, the example for CoCoRes says comparing results, so this is a clear fit. The other options like CoCoXY involve comparing two cited studies, which isn't happening here. Therefore, the top class is CoCoRes. The second could be Neutral if there's no further intent, but the example for Neutral is more descriptive without argument. Here, the comparison is direct, so maybe CoCoRes is the only primary, but the task asks for three. Hmm. Maybe the next could be CoCoGM if the methods are different, but the text doesn't mention methods. Alternatively, maybe Future or Motivation, but that doesn't fit. Perhaps Neutral as the third, but the example for Neutral is more about stating facts without comparison. Alternatively, maybe Support if they're using the cited work to support their own, but they're contrasting instead. 

So the top three are CoCoRes first, then perhaps Neutral as the next, but I need to check the definitions again. Neutral is when the citation is used in a descriptive way without argument. Here, they are contrasting results, so Neutral isn't the best fit. Maybe CoCoXY if comparing two studies, but it's between the current work and the cited. So perhaps CoCoRes is first, then maybe CoCoGM if there's a method comparison, but the text doesn't specify methods. Alternatively, maybe Basis if the cited work is foundational, but the example shows introducing a method, which isn't the case here. 

Wait, the example for CoCoRes is almost identical: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." So the example given in the problem is the same as the CoCoRes example. Therefore, the primary class is CoCoRes. Then, maybe the next is Neutral if there's no further intent, but Neutral is when the citation is just descriptive. Since they are contrasting results, Neutral isn't appropriate. Maybe the third is CoCoXY if comparing explanations between two cited works, but that's not the case here. 

Alternatively, perhaps the third is Support, but that's when the cited work supports the current findings. Here, it's the opposite. Therefore, the top three classes are CoCoRes, then maybe CoCoGM if there's a method comparison, but the text doesn't mention methods. Alternatively, maybe Weakness if they're pointing out a flaw, but they're just contrasting results. 

Hmm. Given the strict definitions, the primary is CoCoRes. The second could be CoCoXY if comparing explanations, but since it's between current work and cited, not two cited works. So maybe Neutral as the third. But Neutral is when it's just stating facts. Alternatively, maybe the third is Basis if the cited work is foundational, but that's not the case here. 

Given the example provided in the problem matches CoCoRes exactly, the first is CoCoRes. The second could be CoCoGM if there's a method comparison, but the text doesn't specify. Alternatively, maybe Future or Motivation, but that doesn't fit. Perhaps Neutral is third, even though it's a comparison. 

Wait, the Neutral example is about stating facts without argument. Here, the citation is used to contrast results, which is an argumentative point, so Neutral isn't appropriate. Therefore, the third might be CoCoGM, assuming that the methods differ. But the text doesn't mention methods, only the results. 

This is tricky. Given the strict definitions, CoCoRes is first. The other two might be CoCoGM and Neutral, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe CoCoRes is first, then Neutral and then CoCoXY. But I think CoCoRes is the only clear one here. The user requires three, so perhaps the answer is CoCoRes, then Neutral, then CoCoXY, but I'm not certain. However, based on the example provided, CoCoRes is the primary, and the others may not fit. Maybe the answer is CoCoRes, then CoCoGM, then Neutral. But without explicit mention of methods or goals, it's hard. Given the example matches CoCoRes, I'll go with CoCoRes as first, then maybe Neutral and then CoCoXY as the next two, even if it's a stretch.
