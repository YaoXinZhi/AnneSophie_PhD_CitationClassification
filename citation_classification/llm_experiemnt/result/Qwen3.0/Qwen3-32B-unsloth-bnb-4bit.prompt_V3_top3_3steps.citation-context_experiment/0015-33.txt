Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the citation marked @@CITATION@@. The passage says, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." 

So the key part here is the comparison between the current study's results and those from the cited experiments. The phrase "substantially differ" directly indicates a comparison of results. Looking at the definitions, CoCoRes is when the citation is used to compare results or findings. 

Next, the general intent here is comparative, focusing on contrasting results. There's no mention of motivation, future work, support, or other categories. The example given for CoCoRes matches this scenario where results are compared. 

Are there any other possible classes? Maybe CoCoXY if it's comparing explanations, but the example there involves comparing two cited studies, not the citing paper's results. So CoCoRes is the top choice. Neutral doesn't fit because it's a direct comparison. Basis is about foundational work, which isn't the case here. So the top three would be CoCoRes, then maybe CoCoGM or CoCoXY if there's any method or goal comparison, but the text specifically mentions results. The third might be Neutral if there's no other fit, but since the comparison is clear, Neutral isn't appropriate. Wait, maybe the example given in CoCoRes is similar, so 1. CoCoRes, then maybe Basis if the cited work is foundational, but the example doesn't suggest that. Alternatively, if there's no other, the next could be Neutral or CoCoXY. But in this case, since the comparison is strictly about results, CoCoRes is first, then maybe Neutral if there's no further intent, but I don't see another. Hmm, perhaps Neutral isn't applicable here. Wait, the example for CoCoRes is exactly matching the structure. So the top three are CoCoRes, then maybe CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two cited studies, but the example here compares cited results with current results, so CoCoRes is the primary. The other two might be Basis or Neutral. But the text doesn't indicate foundational work or neutrality. Maybe Neutral isn't the right fit here. Wait, the example given for CoCoRes is when comparing cited results with current results, which is exactly what's happening here. So the top three would be CoCoRes first, then perhaps Neutral if there's no other intent, but I don't see another. Alternatively, maybe the next is CoCoGM if there's a method comparison, but the text mentions results. So the third might be Neutral. But the example for Neutral is more descriptive without argument. Since this is a direct comparison of results, Neutral isn't appropriate here. So the top three would be CoCoRes, then maybe CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two cited studies, but the example here is comparing cited results with current results. So perhaps only CoCoRes is applicable here. Wait, the user wants three classes, so maybe the next two are Basis and Neutral. But the text doesn't indicate foundational work or neutrality. Hmm, maybe the third is Basis if the cited work is foundational, but the example doesn't suggest that. Alternatively, maybe Weakness if the cited results are being criticized, but the text says "substantially differ," which is a neutral comparison, not criticism. So Weakness isn't right. Therefore, the top three are CoCoRes, then maybe Neutral and Basis. But I'm not sure. Wait, the example for CoCoRes is the best fit here. The next could be CoCoXY if comparing explanations between two cited works, but in this case, it's comparing cited results with current results, so CoCoRes is the only applicable. But the user requires three, so perhaps Neutral is the third. But Neutral is when the citation is descriptive without argument. Since this is a direct comparison, Neutral isn't correct. Maybe the third is Basis, but again, no indication here. Alternatively, perhaps CoCoGM if the methods are compared, but the text mentions results. Hmm. Maybe the correct top three are CoCoRes, then CoCoXY and Neutral. But I'm not certain. Wait, maybe the third is CoCoXY if the cited work is compared with another study mentioned, but the example here only compares the cited work's results with the current study's. So CoCoXY is when comparing two cited studies. Therefore, the third might be Neutral. But Neutral isn't fitting here. Maybe the answer is CoCoRes, then maybe CoCoGM and Basis. But again, the text doesn't mention methods or goals. I think the correct answer is CoCoRes as the primary, then Neutral and Basis as the next two, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe only CoCoRes is correct, but the user wants three. Since the example given for CoCoRes is exactly matching, I'll go with CoCoRes as first. The second could be CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two cited works, but in this case, it's between cited and current. Therefore, perhaps the next two are Basis and Neutral. But without clear evidence, maybe Neutral is third. So final answer: 1. CoCoRes, 2. Neutral, 3. Basis.
