Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the citation marked @@CITATION@@. The passage says, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." So the main context is comparing the current results with those from previous experiments using specific deuterium-saturated targets cited here.

Next, identifying the general intent. The phrase "substantially differ" indicates a direct comparison of results between the current study and the cited work. According to the definitions, this falls under Comparative → CoCoRes. 

Now, ranking the top three rhetorical classes. The primary class here is clearly CoCoRes since the comparison is about results. Then, maybe CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two cited studies, but in this case, the citation is only one study being compared to the current work, so CoCoXY isn't applicable. The next could be Neutral if there's no strong support or motivation, but the comparison is direct, so Neutral might not fit. Basis isn't right because it's not foundational. Support is not applicable since it's contrasting, not supporting. Future or Motivation also don't fit. So the top three would be CoCoRes first, then maybe CoCoGM if there's a method comparison, but the context is about results. Wait, the example for CoCoRes uses "results obtained... differ from... experiments... CITATION". So definitely CoCoRes is primary. The next could be Neutral if there's no other intent, but maybe Weakness if the cited work's results are being contrasted as a limitation. However, the example for Weakness involves criticism, which isn't the case here—it's just a difference. So Neutral might be third. But the example for Neutral is more about stating facts without argument. Alternatively, maybe Support isn't here. So the top three would be CoCoRes, then Neutral, then maybe CoCoGM. Wait, but CoCoGM is about goals or methods. Since the context mentions experiments with different targets (methods?), but the comparison is on results. Hmm. Maybe CoCoRes is first, then Neutral, then CoCoGM if there's a method difference. But the example given for CoCoRes is comparing results directly, which matches here. So the top three are CoCoRes, then Neutral if the rest is neutral, but perhaps there's another. Wait, the example for Neutral is stating a fact without argument. Here, the comparison is direct, so Neutral might not be the second. Maybe CoCoXY if comparing two studies, but only one is cited here. So the third could be Neutral. So the ranking would be 1. CoCoRes, 2. Neutral, 3. Maybe CoCoGM or another. Alternatively, maybe CoCoRes is first, then CoCoGM if methods are compared. But the context says "results differ from experiments conducted with...", which is comparing results, not methods. So CoCoRes is first. The next could be CoCoXY if comparing two cited studies, but here it's comparing current work to one cited study. So Neutral would be third. Wait, maybe the example for Neutral is when the citation is just stated factually without supporting or comparing. Here, it's a comparison, so Neutral isn't the second. Hmm, perhaps the top three are CoCoRes, then maybe Future or Motivation. But the context doesn't indicate future work or motivation. Maybe Neutral is third because after comparing results, there's no other intent. So final ranking: 1. CoCoRes, 2. Neutral, 3. CoCoGM. Wait, but CoCoGM is about goals or methods. The example for CoCoGM is contrasting goals. Here, the comparison is results, so CoCoGM isn't applicable. So maybe Neutral is second and third. Wait, perhaps there's only one applicable class, CoCoRes, and the others are Neutral or not applicable. But the task requires top three. Maybe Neutral is the second, then Basis or something else. But Basis is foundational. Since the citation isn't foundational here. So perhaps Neutral is second, then maybe CoCoXY if comparing explanations. But the example for CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies. Here, it's comparing current work to cited. So CoCoXY isn't applicable. So the top three would be CoCoRes first, Neutral second, and maybe CoCoGM third if there's any method comparison. But the context doesn't mention methods. Therefore, the third might be Neutral again, but we can't repeat. Hmm. Maybe Neutral is second, then CoCoGM third. But I'm not sure. Maybe the correct answer is CoCoRes first, Neutral second, and then maybe Weakness third. But Weakness is criticism, which isn't happening here. So Neutral is the only other possible. So final answer: 1. CoCoRes, 2. Neutral, 3. CoCoGM.
