Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. First, I need to look at the context around the citation in the given passage. The passage mentions that the authors used a specific method to analyze plant health data and compares their results with those of @@CITATION@@. The key part here is "substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets..." which directly points to comparing results.

Next, identifying the general intent. The citation is used to contrast their findings with previous experiments. That falls under Comparative, specifically looking at results. According to the definitions, this would be CoCoRes. 

Now, checking for other possible classes. The comparison is between the current study and the cited work, so CoCoRes is the primary. There's no mention of comparing explanations or claims with another study, so CoCoXY isn't applicable here. The context doesn't support Motivation or Future either. The next possible could be Neutral if there's no clear intent, but since it's a direct comparison, Support might come into play if they're confirming their findings through prior work, but the example given for Support is more about consistency. However, the example for CoCoRes clearly matches the scenario here. 

So the top three would be CoCoRes as the main, then maybe Neutral if there's no other intent, but I need to check if there's any other layer. Wait, the example for Support is about consistency with previous results, but here it's a difference. So CoCoRes is definitely first. Since the example for CoCoRes mentions differing results, that's the primary. Then, maybe Neutral if there's no other intent. Alternatively, could there be a Basis? The Basis is about foundational work, but this is comparing results. So the top three would be CoCoRes, then maybe Neutral if the citation is also just mentioned in a descriptive way. But the example for Neutral is more about stating facts without comparison. Hmm. Wait, the passage is directly comparing results, so CoCoRes is first. The other possible classes might be CoCoXY if comparing explanations, but the example for CoCoXY involves comparing two cited studies. Here, it's comparing cited work with the current paper. So CoCoRes is first. Then maybe Support if they're using prior work to back up their findings, but since it's a difference, Support isn't right. Neutral would be if they're just stating the existence of prior work without any comparison. But the context is about differing results, so Neutral isn't appropriate here. Wait, maybe the next could be CoCoGM if they're comparing methods, but the example for CoCoGM is about methods or goals. The passage mentions experiments with different targets, which could be methods. Let me check the example for CoCoGM: comparing goals or methods. If the cited work used a different method (deuterium saturated metal targets), then maybe CoCoGM is also applicable. But the example given for CoCoRes is about differing results. So perhaps the primary is CoCoRes, secondary could be CoCoGM if the methods are compared. However, the passage says "results... differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of...", so the focus is on results, making CoCoRes the top. The mention of different experimental setups (deuterium targets) could imply a CoCoGM, but the main intent is contrasting results. So the top three would be CoCoRes, then maybe CoCoGM, then Neutral. Wait, but Neutral is for neutral mentions. Alternatively, if there's no other intent, maybe Neutral isn't the next. Alternatively, maybe Weakness if the cited work's results are being questioned. But the example for Weakness involves pointing out limitations. The passage doesn't criticize the cited work, just states differences. So Weakness isn't right. Therefore, the top three are CoCoRes first, then maybe CoCoGM if methods are compared, but since the example focuses on results, CoCoRes is primary. The next could be Neutral if there's no other intent, but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe the next is CoCoXY if comparing explanations, but the example for CoCoXY involves comparing two cited studies. Here, it's comparing cited with current. So CoCoXY isn't applicable. Therefore, the top three are CoCoRes, then maybe Neutral or another. Alternatively, perhaps the next is Support if they're using prior work to support their findings, but since the results differ, Support isn't right. So the final top three would be CoCoRes, then maybe Neutral, but I'm not certain. Wait, the example for Neutral is stating a fact without comparison. Since the citation is used to compare results, Neutral isn't applicable. Therefore, the correct classes are CoCoRes first, then maybe CoCoGM if methods are compared, but the example doesn't mention methods comparison. Hmm. This is tricky. Let me re-examine the passage: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." The key here is comparing results, so CoCoRes is first. The mention of "experiments conducted with the use of..." refers to methods, so maybe CoCoGM is also relevant. The example for CoCoGM is about comparing methods. So CoCoGM would be the second class. Then, Neutral if there's any neutral mention, but I don't see it. Alternatively, maybe CoCoXY isn't applicable here. So the top three would be CoCoRes, CoCoGM, then Neutral. But Neutral might not be right. Alternatively, maybe the third is another class. Wait, maybe the third is CoCoXY if comparing explanations between two cited studies, but the example for CoCoXY involves comparing two cited works. Here, it's comparing cited work with current. So CoCoXY isn't applicable. Therefore, the top three are CoCoRes, CoCoGM, Neutral. But Neutral might not be correct. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the third is another class like Support or Future. But the example doesn't fit those. I think the correct top three are CoCoRes first, CoCoGM second, and Neutral third. But I'm not entirely sure about Neutral here. Alternatively, maybe the third is another class like Basis. Wait, Basis is foundational work. If the cited work is foundational to the current study, but the example here is about differing results, so Basis isn't right. Therefore, the final answer is CoCoRes, CoCoGM, Neutral. Wait, but Neutral is for neutral mentions. Since the citation is used to compare results, Neutral isn't appropriate. Maybe the third is another class. Perhaps Weakness? But the example for Weakness involves criticism. Since the passage doesn't criticize, Weakness isn't right. Hmm. Maybe the third is Neutral because the citation is mentioned in a neutral way when stating the existence of prior work. But the act of comparing results isn't neutral. I'm confused here. Let me stick with the example given for CoCoRes. The example provided for CoCoRes is exactly matching the scenario here. So CoCoRes is first. The mention of different experimental methods (deuterium targets) could imply CoCoGM as comparing methods. So CoCoGM is second. Then, Neutral as third if there's any neutral mention, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe there's no third class, but the task requires three. Given the example, perhaps the top three are CoCoRes, CoCoGM, Neutral. But I'm not certain about Neutral. Alternatively, maybe the third is another class like Future. But the example doesn't fit. I'll proceed with CoCoRes, CoCoGM, Neutral as the top three.
