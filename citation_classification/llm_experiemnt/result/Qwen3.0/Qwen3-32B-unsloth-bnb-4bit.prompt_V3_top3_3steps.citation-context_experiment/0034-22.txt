Okay, let's tackle this classification task. First, I need to look at the citation passage provided. The user mentioned that the citation is marked as @@CITATION@@, so I should focus on the surrounding text.

Looking at the example given in the context, the passage says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." 

So the context here is comparing the results of the current study with those from a previous study that used different metal targets. The key phrase is "substantially differ," which indicates a direct comparison of results. 

Now, referring back to the rhetorical classes, CoCoRes is for comparing results. The example provided in the instructions matches this scenario exactly. There's also a mention of conflicting results in another example for CoCoXY, but in this case, it's a direct comparison between the current work and the cited work, not between two cited studies. 

The general intent here is comparative, specifically focusing on results. There's no indication of supporting, motivating, or future work. The citation isn't being used to criticize or question the previous work either. So Weakness and Motivation don't fit. 

Neutral would be if it's just stating facts without comparison, but here it's clearly contrasting results. Therefore, CoCoRes is the primary class. 

Looking for secondary classes, maybe CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two cited studies, but in this case, it's the current work versus the cited one. So CoCoRes is first. 

The next could be CoCoGM if there's a comparison of goals or methods, but the example here is about results. Neutral might come third if there's any, but the main context is about results. So the top three would be CoCoRes, then maybe Neutral if there's a neutral mention elsewhere, but in the given example, it's straightforward CoCoRes. Wait, the example given in the instructions for CoCoRes is exactly this case. So the top class is definitely CoCoRes. The next could be CoCoXY if there's another comparison mentioned, but the example doesn't have that. So perhaps Neutral or Basis. But the context is about results comparison, so maybe CoCoRes is first, then Neutral if there's any neutral mention. But in the given example, the citation is used purely for comparing results. Therefore, the top three would be CoCoRes, then maybe Neutral or Basis. Wait, Basis is for foundational references. Since the citation here is comparing results, not establishing a foundation, Basis isn't applicable. Neutral would be if the citation is just descriptive without argument. But here, the comparison is direct. So the top three are CoCoRes as first, then maybe CoCoGM or CoCoXY as second and third. But since the example is comparing results between the current work and the cited work, CoCoRes is the primary. There's no other comparison mentioned. So the next classes might be Neutral or Basis. But since the example doesn't indicate any of those, maybe the top three are CoCoRes, then Neutral, then Basis. Wait, but the example doesn't mention any of those. Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is CoCoRes first, then Neutral if there's a neutral part. Alternatively, perhaps the example is straightforward CoCoRes only. But the task requires three classes. Let me check the example again. The example given in the instructions for CoCoRes is the one with "substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted..." So in that case, CoCoRes is the primary class. The next possible classes could be CoCoGM if there's a method comparison, but the example doesn't mention methods. So maybe Neutral and Basis. But Basis is for foundational references. Since this is a comparison of results, Basis isn't applicable. Neutral would be if the citation is just stating facts without argument, but here it's contrasting results. So perhaps the top three are CoCoRes, then maybe Neutral if there's a neutral mention elsewhere. But in the given example, there's no neutral part. Therefore, the top three might be CoCoRes, then Neutral, then Basis as the least likely. Wait, maybe the correct answer is CoCoRes as first, CoCoXY as second if there's a comparison between two cited works, but in this case, it's between current and cited. So CoCoXY is not applicable. Therefore, the top three are CoCoRes, Neutral, Basis. But Neutral and Basis don't fit here. Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is CoCoRes first, then maybe CoCoGM if there's a comparison of methods, but the example doesn't mention methods. So perhaps CoCoRes is the only applicable class here, but the task requires three. Wait, perhaps in some cases, even if the primary is CoCoRes, the secondary could be Neutral or CoCoGM. But given the example, I think the correct answer is CoCoRes first, then Neutral, then Basis. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe CoCoRes is first, then CoCoXY if comparing two studies, but the example is comparing current to cited. So perhaps CoCoRes is first, then maybe Neutral, then Basis. But I'm not certain. Wait, the example given for CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies with each other, not with the current work. So in the given example, it's CoCoRes. Therefore, the top three classes would be CoCoRes, Neutral, and Basis. But I'm not sure if Neutral applies here. Alternatively, maybe the example doesn't have Neutral or Basis. Maybe the correct answer is CoCoRes as first, then maybe Basis if the citation is foundational, but the example is about differing results. Hmm. This is tricky. Given the example provided, the correct answer is CoCoRes as the primary class. The next two might be Neutral and Basis, but I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps the correct answer is CoCoRes, then Neutral, then Basis. But maybe Basis isn't applicable here. Alternatively, maybe the top three are CoCoRes, then maybe CoCoGM and CoCoXY as secondary and tertiary. But since the example is about results comparison, CoCoRes is first. The others might not fit. Therefore, the final answer is CoCoRes, Neutral, Basis. But I'm not entirely confident. Wait, maybe Neutral isn't applicable here. Let me re-read the example. The example says the results differ from previous experiments. That's a direct comparison of results, so CoCoRes is first. There's no other comparison mentioned. Therefore, the next classes might be Neutral or Basis. But since the citation isn't being used neutrally or as a basis, maybe the other two are Neutral and Basis. But I'm not sure. Maybe the correct answer is CoCoRes first, then Neutral, then Basis. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the example is straightforward CoCoRes only. But the task requires three classes, so perhaps the user expects three even if some are less likely. Maybe CoCoRes, then maybe CoCoGM if there's a comparison of goals or methods. But the example doesn't mention methods. Hmm. Alright, I'll proceed with CoCoRes as first, then maybe Neutral as second, and Basis as third, even if Basis isn't the best fit.
