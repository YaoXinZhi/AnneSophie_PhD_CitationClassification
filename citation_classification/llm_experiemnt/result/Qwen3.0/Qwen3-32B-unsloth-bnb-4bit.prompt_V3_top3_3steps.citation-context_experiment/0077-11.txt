Okay, let's see. I need to classify the citation in the given passage into the top three rhetorical classes. First, I'll look at the context around the citation. The sentence says, "In addition, the presence of phytoplasma in the roots was confirmed by the PCR-based detection of the 16S rRNA gene @@CITATION@." 

So the author is confirming the presence of phytoplasma in roots using PCR detection of the 16S rRNA gene, and they're citing a previous study. The intent here seems to be supporting their own finding with the cited work. The citation is used to back up their confirmation method.

Looking at the classes, Support would fit here because they're using the citation to support their result. Also, Basis might be relevant since the PCR method could be foundational to their research. But maybe it's more about supporting their specific finding rather than the foundation. Neutral could be possible if they're just stating a fact without argument, but the context is about confirming their result with a cited method. 

Wait, the example for Support mentions confirming the work of the citing authors. In this case, the authors are confirming their own finding using the cited method. So maybe Support is the primary class. Basis might be if they're referencing the origin of the method. Here, PCR-based detection is a method they're using, so Usage could also be a possibility if they're directly using the method from the cited work. However, the example for Usage refers to an experimental setup described previously. Here, it's the detection method itself, so maybe Usage is applicable. 

But the example for Support includes a case where the cited work's results align with the current findings. The sentence here is about confirming their result using the cited method. So Support is likely first. Then maybe Usage if they're using the PCR method from the cited paper. Basis could be if the cited work is foundational to their approach. However, the citation here is about confirming presence via PCR, which is a specific result, so Support might be more accurate. 

Alternatively, Neutral could be if they're just stating a fact without argument. But the example for Neutral is more about a descriptive mention without supporting an argument. Here, the citation is supporting their confirmation, so Neutral might not fit. 

So the top classes would be Support, then maybe Usage or Basis. Let me check the definitions again. Support: used to support, confirm the work. Usage: refers to a method used in the current study. The cited work's PCR method is being used here, so Usage could be appropriate. But the sentence is about confirming presence via PCR, which the cited work did. So maybe Support is better. 

Hmm. The example for Support says "support, or confirm the work, result or finding of the citing authors." In this case, the authors are confirming their own result using the cited work's method. So Support is correct. Basis would be if the cited work is the foundation of their research. If the PCR method was introduced by the cited work, then Basis might apply. But if they're using the method from the cited work, that's Usage. 

Wait, the example for Usage is "experimental set-up was described in detail previously." Here, the PCR-based detection is the method used, so Usage would fit. But the sentence is about confirming their result via PCR detection, which was done in the cited work. So maybe it's both Support and Usage. 

But the task is to rank three classes. Let me think again. The primary intent is supporting their finding with the cited work's result, so Support is first. Then, maybe Basis if the cited work is foundational. Alternatively, if the cited work's method is being used, Usage is second. Neutral could be third if there's no strong argument. 

So the top three would be Support, Usage, Neutral? Or Support, Basis, Neutral? 

Wait, the example for Basis is introducing and validating a method. If the cited work introduced the PCR method, then Basis would apply. If the current study is using that method, then Usage. So if the citation is about the method's origin, Basis; if it's about using the method, Usage. 

In the given sentence, the authors are confirming presence via PCR detection, which the cited work did. So the citation is supporting their own confirmation by referencing the cited work's result. So Support is first. Then, maybe CoCoRes if comparing results. But the example for CoCoRes is comparing results between the current work and the cited work. Here, they're not comparing but confirming their own result with the cited one. 

Alternatively, Neutral if they're just stating a fact. But the example for Neutral is more descriptive without supporting an argument. Here, the citation is supporting their confirmation, so Neutral might not fit. 

So the top classes would be Support, then maybe Usage if they're using the method, and Neutral as third. But I'm a bit confused between Support and Usage here. Let me recheck the example for Support: "All subscales were consistent with previous research... participants did not distinguish..." which is similar to the current sentence. So Support is correct. Usage is when they use a method from the cited work. Here, the PCR detection is the method used, so Usage could be applicable. 

Therefore, the top three would be Support, Usage, Neutral. Wait, but Neutral might not be appropriate. Maybe CoCoRes is not applicable here. 

Alternatively, maybe CoCoRes is not right because they're not comparing results but supporting their own with the cited result. So the top three would be Support, Usage, Basis. Hmm. This is tricky. Let me go back to the definitions. 

Support: used to support, confirm the work, result or finding of the citing authors. 

Usage: refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup from the cited work that is directly used in the current study. 

In this case, the cited work's PCR-based detection method is used in the current study to confirm presence. So Usage is applicable. But the sentence is stating that they confirmed presence by PCR detection (as done in the cited work). So they're using the method from the cited work. Therefore, Usage is appropriate. 

So the primary is Support, secondary is Usage. Then maybe Basis if the cited work is foundational. If the cited work introduced the PCR method for phytoplasma detection, then Basis would be relevant. But if it's just a result confirmation, maybe not. 

Alternatively, Neutral is if they're just stating a fact without supporting an argument. But here, they are supporting their own finding. 

So the top three classes are Support, Usage, Neutral. But Neutral might not fit. Alternatively, maybe CoCoRes if comparing results, but they are confirming their own result with the cited one, not comparing. 

Hmm. I think Support is first, Usage is second, and Neutral is third. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check the example for Neutral again. The Neutral example is about the spread of magnetic treatment devices in the USA since 1975. It's a descriptive statement. Here, confirming presence via PCR is more about supporting their finding, so Neutral isn't the best fit. 

Therefore, the top three would be Support, Usage, and maybe Basis if the cited work is foundational. If the cited work introduced the PCR method, then Basis. Otherwise, maybe CoCoRes isn't applicable. 

I think the correct classes here are Support and Usage. Basis might not apply unless the cited work is the foundation. Since the sentence is about confirming their result using the cited method, Support and Usage are the main ones. Neutral might be third if there's no strong argument. 

So final answer: 1. Support, 2. Usage, 3. Neutral.

1. Support  
2. Usage  
3. Neutral
