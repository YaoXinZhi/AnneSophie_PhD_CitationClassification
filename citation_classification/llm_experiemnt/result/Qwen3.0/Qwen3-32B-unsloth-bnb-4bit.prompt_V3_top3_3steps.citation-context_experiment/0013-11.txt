Okay, let's tackle this classification problem step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the citation marked @@CITATION@@. The passage is talking about the introduction and validation of the IAT by studying biases in humans without social concern, and then replicating those results for the same purposes. The citation here is used to reference the foundational work that established the IAT.

Next, I need to determine the general intent. The example given under the Basis class mentions introducing and validating a method, which aligns with foundational intent. The current passage is replicating the results of the cited work, indicating that the citation serves as a basis for their own research.

Now, looking at the specific rhetorical classes. Basis is clearly applicable here since the citation is the intellectual foundation. The other classes like Support might come into play if they were confirming their results with the cited work, but the example provided under Basis seems more fitting. There's no comparison with other works or methods, so CoCoGM or CoCoRes aren't relevant here. Motivation isn't present as they're not justifying the need for their research based on the citation. Neutral is unlikely because the citation is being used to reference foundational work rather than just state a fact. So the top three would be Basis first, then maybe Support if there's any confirmation, but given the example, Basis is primary. Neutral might be third if there's no other clear classes, but the example under Basis is very similar to the given passage. So the top three are Basis, Support, Neutral.

1. Basis  
2. Support  
3. Neutral
