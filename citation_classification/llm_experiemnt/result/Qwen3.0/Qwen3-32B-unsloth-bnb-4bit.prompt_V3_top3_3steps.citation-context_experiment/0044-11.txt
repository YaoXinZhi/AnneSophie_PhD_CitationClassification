Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. First, I need to look at the citation passage where @@CITATION@@ is mentioned. The passage says, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." 

So, the key part here is "substantially differ from the results of the experiments..." which directly compares the current study's results with those from the cited work. According to the definitions provided, CoCoRes is when the citation is used to compare or contrast results. That's definitely the primary intent here.

Next, I need to check if there's a secondary or tertiary classification. The passage doesn't mention comparing goals or methods, nor does it refer to explaining claims between two studies. There's no motivation or future work suggested either. The comparison is straightforward between results. The only other possible class might be Neutral, but since the citation is actively contrasting results, Neutral doesn't fit. The third could be Basis if it's foundational, but the example given for Basis is about introducing a method, which isn't the case here. So the top three would be CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral if there's no other applicable class. Wait, maybe CoCoXY? No, CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies with each other, not with the current paper. So CoCoRes is first, then maybe nothing else. Wait, the example for CoCoRes is exactly matching the context here. So the top is CoCoRes. The next could be Basis if it's foundational, but in this case, the cited work is being contrasted, not serving as a foundation. So perhaps Neutral is next, but Neutral is when it's just descriptive without any argument. Since the citation is contrasting results, Neutral isn't right. Hmm. Wait, maybe there's no second or third here. Wait, the instructions say to list top three even if some aren't fitting. Maybe Neutral is the third. But in this case, the citation is directly contrasting results, so CoCoRes is first, then maybe nothing else applies. Wait, maybe CoCoXY isn't right here. Let me check the example for CoCoXY: "Fast multiplication rates... although conflicting results were described..." which compares two studies. But in our case, it's comparing the cited study with the current one. So CoCoRes is the correct first class. Then perhaps the next is Basis if it's foundational, but I don't think so. Maybe Weakness? No, Weakness is criticizing the cited work, which isn't happening here. So the top three would be CoCoRes, then maybe Neutral if there's no other. Wait, Neutral example is when it's just descriptive. The passage is contrasting results, so Neutral isn't fitting. Maybe the only applicable is CoCoRes. But the task requires three classes. Maybe the second is CoCoGM or something else. Wait, the example for CoCoGM is comparing goals or methods. Here, the comparison is results, so CoCoRes is correct. So the top three would be CoCoRes, then maybe Neutral as third if forced. But Neutral doesn't fit. Maybe the second and third are other classes. Wait, maybe the answer is CoCoRes, then maybe CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two cited studies, but in the example given, CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies with each other. Here, it's comparing cited study with current work. So CoCoRes is first. Then maybe Neutral as third. But Neutral is when it's just descriptive. Hmm. Maybe the answer is CoCoRes, then maybe Weakness as second? No, because Weakness is criticizing. So maybe the correct answer is CoCoRes as first, then Neutral as second and third. But Neutral isn't fitting. Wait, perhaps the answer is CoCoRes, then maybe Support? No, Support is when the citation supports the current work. Here, it's contrasting. So the top three would be CoCoRes, then maybe nothing else applies. But the task requires three. Maybe the answer is CoCoRes, then Neutral as second, then Basis as third. But Basis is foundational. Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral as second and third. But Neutral isn't fitting. Maybe the answer is CoCoRes, then maybe Weakness as second? No. Alternatively, maybe the answer is CoCoRes, then Neutral, then Basis. But Basis isn't fitting. This is confusing. Let me recheck the example for CoCoRes: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@" which matches exactly the example given for CoCoRes. So CoCoRes is definitely first. The second could be CoCoXY if comparing two cited studies, but here it's comparing cited study with current work, so CoCoRes is correct. Maybe the second and third are Neutral. But Neutral is when it's just descriptive. Wait, maybe the answer is CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral as second and third. But Neutral isn't applicable here. Hmm. Maybe the answer is CoCoRes first, then Neutral as second, then Basis as third. But Basis is when it's foundational. Since the cited work is being contrasted, not foundational. So perhaps the answer is CoCoRes first, then Neutral as second, then maybe CoCoXY as third. But CoCoXY isn't applicable here. Wait, maybe there's no second and third. But the task requires three. Maybe the answer is CoCoRes, then Neutral, then Basis. Even if Basis doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the answer is CoCoRes first, then maybe Weakness as second, then Neutral. But Weakness isn't applicable. This is tricky. Let me check the definitions again. The example given for CoCoRes is exactly matching the context. So CoCoRes is first. The other classes don't fit. Maybe the second and third are Neutral and Basis, even if they don't fit perfectly. So the final answer would be:

1. CoCoRes  
2. Neutral  
3. Basis  

But I'm not sure about Neutral and Basis. Alternatively, maybe it's CoCoRes, then maybe CoCoXY if comparing two cited studies, but in this case, it's comparing cited study with current work. So CoCoRes is correct. Maybe the answer is CoCoRes first, then Neutral as second, then Basis as third. Even if Basis isn't perfect. Alternatively, maybe the answer is CoCoRes first, then CoCoGM as second? No, because CoCoGM is comparing goals or methods, not results. So the correct answer is CoCoRes first. The other two might not fit, but the task requires three. So perhaps the answer is CoCoRes, then Neutral, then Basis.
