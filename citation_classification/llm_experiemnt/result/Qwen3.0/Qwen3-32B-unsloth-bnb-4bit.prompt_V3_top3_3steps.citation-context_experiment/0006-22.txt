Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the top three rhetorical classes for the citation marked @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. First, I'll start by looking at the context around the citation to understand its intent.

The passage says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." 

So the authors are comparing their results to those from a previous study. The key phrase here is "substantially differ," which indicates a direct comparison of results. That points towards the CoCoRes class, which is for comparing results between the current work and the cited study. 

Next, I need to check if there's any other context that might suggest additional classes. The example given for CoCoRes is very similar to this case, where the results are being contrasted. There's no mention of comparing goals or methods (CoCoGM) or explanations between two cited studies (CoCoXY). The citation isn't supporting the current work's findings (Support) or motivating the research (Motivation). Also, there's no indication of a weakness in the cited work. 

The main intent here is clearly a comparison of results, so CoCoRes is the primary class. Then, looking for secondary classes, maybe Neutral if there's any descriptive use, but the sentence is making a direct contrast, so Neutral might not apply here. The example for CoCoXY involves comparing two cited studies with each other, but here it's the current work versus the cited study. So CoCoRes is the most accurate. 

Are there any other possible classes? Maybe Basis if the cited work is foundational, but the context is about differing results, not establishing a foundation. So Basis is out. Future or Motivation don't fit either. The top three would likely be CoCoRes first, then maybe CoCoGM if there's a mention of methods, but there's no such mention here. Wait, the example mentions "experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets," so maybe comparing methods? But the example given for CoCoRes is about results, not methods. The phrase here is about the results differing, not the methods. So CoCoRes is still the primary. 

I think the top class is CoCoRes. Then, perhaps Neutral if there's any descriptive aspect, but the comparison is direct. Wait, the Neutral example is more about stating facts without argument. Since the authors are contrasting their results with the cited work, Neutral isn't the case here. 

So the top three would be CoCoRes as the first, then maybe CoCoGM if there's a comparison of methods, but the example here is about results. So CoCoRes is the main one. Maybe CoCoXY isn't applicable because it's comparing two cited studies. Then perhaps Neutral as a third option, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe Support or Similar, but the context is about differing results. Hmm. Maybe Neutral isn't the right third. Wait, maybe Weakness? No, because they aren't criticizing the cited work, just stating that their results differ. 

So the top three classes would be CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral as the second, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe CoCoXY isn't applicable here. Wait, the example for CoCoXY compares two cited studies, not the current work and a cited study. So CoCoRes is definitely the primary. Then maybe Neutral or another class. Hmm. Maybe Support isn't applicable here. 

I think the top three are CoCoRes as the first, then maybe Neutral if the citation is just stating facts, but the comparison is direct. Alternatively, maybe there's a secondary comparison. Wait, the sentence is a direct comparison of results, so CoCoRes is the main class. The example given for CoCoRes matches this case exactly. So the top three would be CoCoRes as 1, then maybe CoCoGM if there's a mention of methods, but the example here is about results. So maybe CoCoRes is the only applicable class. Wait, the task requires three classes, so maybe Neutral is a possibility if there's no other context. But I'm not seeing it. 

Wait, maybe the citation is also serving as a Support? No, because Support is when the cited work supports the current findings. Here, the findings differ, so it's a contrast. Therefore, CoCoRes is the primary, and perhaps Neutral as a secondary if there's any descriptive use. But I'm not sure. Maybe Neutral isn't the case here. Alternatively, maybe Weakness isn't applicable because they aren't criticizing the cited work's limitations. 

Hmm. I'm leaning towards CoCoRes as the top class, then maybe CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two cited studies, but in this case, it's the current work and one cited study. So CoCoRes is definitely first. The other two might be Neutral or another class. Since the example given for CoCoRes matches exactly, I'll go with CoCoRes as the primary. Then perhaps Neutral if there's no other context, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe there's another class. 

Wait, the task says to rank the top three even if only one is clear. So maybe CoCoRes is first, then Neutral and Basis as lower. But Basis is about foundational work, which isn't the case here. So perhaps CoCoRes is first, then maybe Neutral as second, then maybe another class. But I'm not sure. Let me check again. 

The sentence is a direct comparison of results between the current work and the cited study. So CoCoRes is the primary. There's no mention of comparing goals or methods (CoCoGM), explanations between two cited studies (CoCoXY), or supporting the current work (Support). Therefore, the top three would be CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral as second, but the example for Neutral is more about stating facts without argument. Since the citation is used to contrast results, Neutral might not be appropriate. 

Wait, maybe the third class could be CoCoGM if the methods are being compared. The cited study used deuterium saturated metal targets. The current work's methods might differ, but the sentence doesn't mention methods, only results. So CoCoGM isn't applicable here. 

Therefore, the top three classes are CoCoRes as the first, then maybe Neutral as the second and third. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, maybe Weakness isn't applicable. 

After reconsidering, the top three are CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral as second, but I'm not sure. Since the example given for CoCoRes matches exactly, I'll stick with CoCoRes as the primary. The other two classes might be Neutral or another, but I'm not certain. However, based on the given examples, CoCoRes is definitely the first. The second and third might be Neutral and another class, but I'll have to choose based on the available options.
