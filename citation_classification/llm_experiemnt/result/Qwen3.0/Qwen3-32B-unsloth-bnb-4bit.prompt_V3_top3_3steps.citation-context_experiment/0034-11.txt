Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. First, I need to look at the context around the citation marked @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. The passage says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." 

So the citation here is being used to compare the results of the current study with those from another study. The key phrase here is "substantially differ from the results of the experiments," which directly points to a comparison of results. That makes me think the primary class here is CoCoRes, as defined by the example given for that class.

Next, I need to determine if there are other possible classes. The context is about contrasting results, not methods or goals, so CoCoGM and CoCoXY are less likely. The citation isn't supporting the current work's findings, nor is it pointing out a weakness or motivating further research. It's purely a comparison of findings between two studies. However, maybe there's a secondary comparison here. Wait, the example for CoCoXY involves comparing two cited studies with each other, not with the citing paper. In this case, the comparison is between the current work and the cited work, so CoCoRes is the right fit. 

Are there any other possible classes? The passage isn't using the citation to support their own results or to point out similarities. It's a direct contrast of results. So the top class is definitely CoCoRes. The second might be Neutral if there's no strong argumentation, but the example given for Neutral is more descriptive without a direct comparison. Since the comparison is explicit, Neutral is less likely here. The third class could be CoCoXY if there's an indirect comparison between two other studies, but in this case, the comparison is between the current work and the cited one. So the top three would be CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral if there's no other comparison, but I think CoCoRes is the only strong one here. Wait, the example for CoCoRes is similar to the given context. The user's example says "the results obtained... substantially differ from... @@CITATION@@", which matches the example provided. So CoCoRes is the primary. The next could be Neutral if the citation is just stating a fact without further argument, but the context is actively contrasting results, so Neutral might not be the second. Alternatively, maybe Basis if the cited work is foundational, but the context is about differing results, not foundational work. So the top three classes here are CoCoRes as first, then maybe CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two cited studies, but in this case, it's between current and cited. So the second could be Neutral if there's no other intent. Hmm, perhaps the second is CoCoXY if there's an implicit comparison between two other studies mentioned, but the example given doesn't mention another citation. Wait, the user's example for CoCoXY includes two citations compared with each other. In the given context, there's only one citation. Therefore, CoCoXY isn't applicable here. The third might be Neutral if there's no other intent, but the context is about contrasting results, so maybe Weakness isn't there either. So the top three are CoCoRes, then perhaps Neutral if there's no further intent, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe Basis if the cited work is foundational, but the context is contrasting results. So the primary is CoCoRes, second could be Neutral, third maybe Basis. Wait, but the example for Basis is about introducing a method, which isn't the case here. So the correct ranking is CoCoRes as first, then Neutral if there's no other comparison, but Neutral's example is more descriptive. Since the context is a direct comparison of results, CoCoRes is the only strong one. Maybe the second is CoCoXY if the cited work is compared with another study mentioned, but the context here only refers to one citation. Therefore, the top three are CoCoRes, then perhaps Neutral, then Basis. Wait, but the example for Neutral is more like stating a fact without argument. Since the context is contrasting results, Neutral might not fit. Hmm, maybe the second is CoCoGM if there's a method comparison, but the context is about results. I'm a bit stuck here. Let me recheck the definitions. CoCoRes is direct comparison between citing paper and cited work. CoCoXY is between two cited works. Here, it's between citing and cited, so CoCoRes is first. The other options are less likely. So the top three are CoCoRes, then maybe Neutral as the second, then Basis as third if there's no other. But maybe Neutral isn't the second. Alternatively, maybe Weakness if the cited work's results are being criticized, but the context says "substantially differ," not criticizing. So Weakness is not applicable. Therefore, the top three are CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral as second, then Basis as third. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the second is CoCoXY if there's an implicit comparison between two studies mentioned in the cited work. Wait, the cited work here is one study. So CoCoXY is not applicable. Therefore, the final answer is CoCoRes as first, then Neutral, then Basis. Wait, but Neutral is for descriptive use without supporting or comparing. Since the citation is used to compare results, Neutral might not be the second. Maybe the second is CoCoGM if there's a method comparison, but the context is about results. Hmm. I think the correct answer is CoCoRes as first, then maybe Neutral as second, then Basis as third. But I'm not entirely confident. Let me look again at the example for CoCoRes. The example is "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." That's exactly matching the user's example for CoCoRes. So the primary class is CoCoRes. The second could be Neutral if there's no other intent. Neutral's example is more like stating a fact, so maybe Neutral is second. Third could be Basis if the cited work is foundational, but in this case, the cited work is being compared. So perhaps the third is Basis. Alternatively, maybe the third is CoCoGM. Wait, the cited work's methods aren't being compared, only the results. So CoCoGM is not applicable. Therefore, the top three are CoCoRes, Neutral, Basis. But I'm not sure if Neutral is appropriate here. Maybe Weakness is not applicable. So the final answer is CoCoRes, Neutral, Basis. But I'm not certain about Neutral. Alternatively, maybe the second is CoCoXY if there's an implicit comparison between two cited works mentioned. But in the given context, there's only one citation. Therefore, CoCoXY is not applicable. So the top three are CoCoRes, then perhaps Weakness if there's criticism, but the context doesn't criticize, just states differences. Therefore, the correct ranking is CoCoRes first, Neutral second, Basis third.
