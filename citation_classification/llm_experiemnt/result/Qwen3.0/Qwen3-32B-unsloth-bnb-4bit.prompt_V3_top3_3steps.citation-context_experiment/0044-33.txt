Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the citation marked @@CITATION@@. The passage says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." 

So the key part here is that the current study's results are contrasting with those from the cited work. The general intent here seems to be a comparison of results because they are directly stating that their findings differ from the cited experiments. 

Looking at the rhetorical classes, CoCoRes is specifically for comparing results. That's the most direct fit. Next, maybe CoCoXY if they were comparing explanations or claims between studies, but here it's the current work versus the cited one, not two cited studies. So CoCoRes is first.

Then, maybe Basis if they're building on the cited work's foundation, but the context here is about differing results, not foundational. Support or Similar don't fit because they're not supporting their own work with the citation or pointing out similarities. Weakness could be if they're criticizing the cited work, but the example given for Weakness involves pointing out limitations, whereas here it's just a difference in results without criticism. 

Neutral is when it's just descriptive, but here it's a direct comparison. So the top three would be CoCoRes first, then maybe CoCoXY if there's a secondary comparison, but in this case, it's between the current work and the cited one, so CoCoRes is primary. The next could be Basis if the cited work is foundational, but the example for Basis talks about introducing a method. Here, the cited work's results are being compared, not their methods or foundation. 

Wait, the example for CoCoRes is similar: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted..." which matches exactly the example given. So CoCoRes is definitely first. The second could be Neutral if there's no further intent, but maybe there's a secondary intent. Alternatively, maybe Future if they're suggesting future work based on the difference, but the example doesn't indicate that. 

Looking at the other classes, perhaps Weakness if the cited work's results are considered flawed, but the passage just states a difference without criticism. So Neutral might not be right here. Maybe Support isn't applicable. So the top three would be CoCoRes first, then Neutral if there's no other intent, but Neutral is when it's just descriptive. Since the citation is used to compare results, CoCoRes is the primary. The second could be CoCoXY if they're comparing explanations, but the example here doesn't mention explanations. 

So the top three are CoCoRes, then maybe Basis if the cited work's results are part of the foundation, but the example for Basis is about introducing a method. Here, the cited work's results are being compared, not the foundation. Therefore, the top three classes are CoCoRes (1), Neutral (2) if there's no other intent, but Neutral might not fit. Wait, the example for Neutral is when the citation is used descriptively without supporting or comparing. But here it's a direct comparison. So Neutral isn't appropriate. Maybe the second is CoCoGM if they're comparing goals or methods, but the example here is about results. So the only fitting class is CoCoRes. Then, perhaps Weakness if the cited work's results are considered flawed, but the passage doesn't state that. 

Hmm, maybe the second could be Future if the difference suggests future research, but again, the example doesn't indicate that. The third might be Neutral if there's no other intent. But Neutral isn't the right fit here. Wait, the example for Neutral is something like stating a fact without argument. Since the citation is used to compare results, CoCoRes is first. There's no other clear secondary class here. Maybe the other two are Neutral and Basis, but neither fits. Alternatively, maybe Support isn't applicable. So the top three would be CoCoRes (1), then perhaps Basis (2) if the cited work is foundational, but the example for Basis is about introducing a method. Since the cited work's results are being compared, not their methods or foundation, Basis isn't right. Therefore, the correct top three are CoCoRes (1), then maybe Weakness (2) if there's criticism, but the passage doesn't indicate that. Hmm, this is tricky. Based strictly on the given example, the correct class is CoCoRes. The other two might not be present, but the task requires three classes. Maybe Neutral is the next, even though it's not a perfect fit. Alternatively, maybe the second is CoCoXY if comparing explanations, but the example doesn't mention that. Given the strict definitions, CoCoRes is first, then perhaps Neutral and then Basis. But Neutral isn't correct here. Maybe the answer is CoCoRes, then Basis, then Neutral. But I'm not sure. Wait, the example given for CoCoRes is exactly matching the passage's structure. So the primary class is CoCoRes. The other two might be CoCoXY and Neutral, but I'm not certain. Given the instructions, I'll go with CoCoRes as first, then maybe Neutral and then Basis as the other two, even if they don't perfectly fit. Alternatively, maybe the second is CoCoGM or CoCoXY. But without more context, CoCoRes is the only clear one. The other two might be Basis and Neutral, but I'm not confident. The correct answer based on the example is CoCoRes as the top class, then perhaps Neutral and then Basis as the next two, even if they're not perfect.
