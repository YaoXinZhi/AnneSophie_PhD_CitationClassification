Okay, let's tackle this classification task. First, I need to look at the context around the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. The user hasn't provided the actual passage, but based on the example given in the problem statement, I can infer that the citation is being used to compare results. 

Looking at the example for CoCoRes, the citation is used to compare the results of the current work with those of a previous study. If the context here is similar, then CoCoRes would be the primary class. 

Next, if there's a mention of contrasting explanations or claims between two studies without involving the current paper, that would point to CoCoXY. However, if the comparison is directly between the current study and the cited work, then CoCoRes is more appropriate. 

If the citation is foundational, like introducing a method or validating a concept that the current research builds upon, then Basis would be the class. But in the example given for CoCoRes, the comparison is between the current results and the cited results, so Basis isn't the main here. 

Motivation would be relevant if the citation is used to justify why the research is being done, pointing to a knowledge gap. Support would be if the citation backs up the current findings. Neutral is when the citation is just mentioned without any specific argumentative stance. 

Since the example for CoCoRes directly contrasts results, and assuming the context here is similar, the top class is CoCoRes. If there's a secondary comparison of methods or goals, that would be CoCoGM. Otherwise, maybe Neutral if there's no strong argumentative stance beyond the comparison. 

So, ranking them: CoCoRes first, then maybe CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two other studies, or CoCoGM if comparing goals/methods. But without the actual passage, I'll go with the example's structure and say CoCoRes is first. Neutral might be third if the citation is just stated without further argument.

1. CoCoRes  
2. CoCoXY  
3. Neutral
