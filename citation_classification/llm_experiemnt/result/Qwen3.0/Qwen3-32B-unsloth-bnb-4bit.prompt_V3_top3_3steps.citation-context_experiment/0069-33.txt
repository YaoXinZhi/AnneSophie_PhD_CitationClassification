Okay, let's start by looking at the citation in the given passage. The passage mentions that the authors used a specific method for analyzing plant pathogens, and then they reference another study @@CITATION@@ that proposed a similar analytical approach. The sentence says, "Our method for pathogen detection builds upon the framework introduced by @@CITATION@@, though we modified the sample preparation steps to enhance sensitivity."

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The key part here is that the current study is building upon the cited work's framework but with modifications. The intent seems to be foundational since they're referencing a previous method they're building on. That would point towards the "Basis" class. 

Next, comparing the rhetorical classes. Since they're using the cited work as a foundation but modifying it, maybe there's also a comparison of methods involved. The example for CoCoGM mentions comparing goals or methods. Here, the authors are contrasting their method with the cited one by modifying the sample preparation steps. So CoCoGM could also be relevant.

Looking at Support, it's about confirming their findings with previous work, but in this case, it's more about building upon a method rather than supporting a result. Neutral might apply if it's just a descriptive mention, but the citation is actively used to show their method's basis. Weakness doesn't fit here as there's no criticism. Future or Motivation also don't seem right since it's not about future work or justifying the need.

So the top classes would be Basis as the primary, then CoCoGM for the method comparison, and maybe Similar if there's a similarity mentioned. Wait, the example for Similar is pointing out a similarity between the cited work and the current paper. Here, they mention building upon the framework but modifying steps. That's more of a comparison of methods (CoCoGM) rather than similarity. Neutral might come in third if there's no strong support or criticism. 

Wait, the example for Basis is when the citation is the foundation. Since they're using the cited framework as a basis for their method, Basis is definitely first. CoCoGM is second because they compare their method's modifications to the cited method. Neutral would be third if there's no other strong class, but maybe Similar isn't applicable here. Alternatively, if there's a similarity in the approach, but the example for Similar requires pointing out similarity. The sentence says "builds upon the framework introduced by..." which is a similarity, so Similar could be third. But the primary intent is foundational, so Basis is first. So the ranking would be Basis, CoCoGM, Similar.

1. Basis  
2. CoCoGM  
3. Similar
