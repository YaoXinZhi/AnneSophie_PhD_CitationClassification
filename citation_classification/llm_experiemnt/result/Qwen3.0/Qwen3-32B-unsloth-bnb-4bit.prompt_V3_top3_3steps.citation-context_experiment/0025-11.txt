Okay, let's start by looking at the given scientific passage. The task is to determine the top three rhetorical classes for the citation marked @@CITATION@@.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The relevant sentence is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@."

The key part here is that the authors are comparing their results ("substantially differ from the results") with those from a previous study cited. According to the definitions provided, when a citation is used to directly compare results or findings, the appropriate class is CoCoRes. 

Next, I need to consider if there are other possible classes. The sentence is contrasting their results with the cited work's results, so CoCoRes is definitely the primary class here. There's no indication of comparing methods or goals, nor is there a mention of similar findings or supporting the current work. The citation isn't being used for motivation or future directions either. 

Looking at Neutral, the example given is a descriptive use without specific argumentation. Here, the citation is being used to highlight a contrast in results, which is more specific than Neutral. CoCoXY involves comparing explanations between two cited studies, but here it's the current work comparing with the cited study, not comparing two cited works. 

So the primary class is CoCoRes. The next possible classes might be Neutral if there's a general mention, but since the comparison is direct and significant, CoCoRes is higher. There's no other clear secondary class here. Maybe Weakness if the cited work was being criticized, but the sentence doesn't indicate that. The example for Weakness includes criticism, which isn't present here. 

Therefore, the top three classes would be CoCoRes as the first, Neutral if there's a descriptive aspect, but since the comparison is direct, perhaps Neutral isn't even applicable. Wait, maybe the second class could be CoCoGM if there's a comparison of methods, but the example given for CoCoGM is comparing goals or methods. Here, the comparison is about results, so CoCoRes is the only clear class. The next classes might be Neutral or Basis. The Basis example refers to foundational work, but here it's a comparison. So the top three would be CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral if the citation is just describing results, but since it's a contrast, Neutral isn't fitting. Perhaps the second and third classes would be Neutral and Basis, but I'm not sure. Wait, the example for Neutral is a descriptive citation without supporting, comparing, etc. Here, the citation is being used to contrast results, so Neutral isn't appropriate. The only fitting class is CoCoRes. However, the instructions ask for top three, so maybe CoCoRes, then Neutral, then maybe Basis. But I need to check if there's any other context. Since the sentence is only contrasting results, CoCoRes is the primary. The next possible could be CoCoXY if comparing explanations, but that's not the case here. Maybe Weakness if the cited work's results are being criticized, but the sentence doesn't indicate that. Therefore, the top three would be CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral as a lower priority if the citation is just mentioned descriptively, but in this case, the citation is directly compared. So perhaps CoCoRes is the only one, but the task requires three. Maybe Neutral is the second because it's just stating the cited work's results, but since it's a direct comparison, Neutral isn't the right fit. Hmm. Maybe the second is CoCoXY if the comparison is between two cited works, but here it's between the current work and the cited work. Therefore, CoCoRes is the primary, and the other two classes might be CoCoGM or CoCoXY if applicable, but they aren't. So perhaps the answer is CoCoRes as first, Neutral as second if forced to pick, but I'm not certain. Wait, the example for Neutral is a descriptive citation without specific argumentation. Here, the citation is part of a comparison argument, so Neutral isn't appropriate. Therefore, the only valid class is CoCoRes, but the task requires three. Maybe the second is Basis if the cited work is foundational, but the example for Basis is introducing a method. Here, the cited work's results are being compared, not the foundation. Therefore, maybe the top three are CoCoRes, then maybe Future or Motivation, but there's no indication of future work or motivation. So perhaps CoCoRes is first, then Neutral and Basis as the next two, even though they might not fit perfectly. Alternatively, maybe CoCoRes is the only correct class and the others are Neutral or Basis. Given the instructions require three, but the context only supports one, perhaps the answer is CoCoRes, then Neutral, then Basis as the lowest priority.
