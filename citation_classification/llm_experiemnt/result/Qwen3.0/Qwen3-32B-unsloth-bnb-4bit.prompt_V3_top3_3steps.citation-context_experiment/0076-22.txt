Okay, let's tackle this classification task step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the @@CITATION@@. The given passage is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." 

So, the context here is about comparing the results of the current work with those from previous experiments using specific metal targets cited in @@CITATION@@. The key phrase here is "substantially differ," which indicates a direct comparison of results.

Next, determining the general intent. Since the citation is used to contrast results, this falls under Comparative. Looking at the subclasses, CoCoRes is the primary one here because it's a direct comparison of results between the current study and the cited work. 

Now, the top three rhetorical classes. The main one is definitely CoCoRes. Then, maybe CoCoXY if there's a comparison between explanations or claims of studies, but in this case, it's specifically comparing results, not explanations. So CoCoXY might not be relevant here. The example for CoCoRes matches this scenario exactly. 

Looking at other possibilities, Neutral would apply if it's just stating facts without comparison, but here there's an active comparison. Support isn't fitting because the citation isn't supporting the current work but contrasting it. Weakness would be if the cited work's results were criticized, but the passage doesn't do thatâ€”it just states a difference. 

So the top three are CoCoRes first. Then maybe Neutral as the second if there's a neutral mention, but the example given for Neutral is more about stating existence without comparison. Since the citation here is directly contrasting results, Neutral isn't the best second. Maybe CoCoGM if there's a method comparison, but the context mentions results, not goals or methods. 

Wait, the example for CoCoRes is almost identical to the given passage. So CoCoRes is definitely first. Then perhaps Neutral as the second if there's no other clear subclass. But the passage is clearly contrasting results, so Neutral isn't right. Maybe there's no second subclass applicable here. But the instructions say to list top three. The example given for CoCoRes is exactly matching the scenario. So the top three would be CoCoRes first. The other two might be Neutral or CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two cited studies, but here it's between the current work and the cited work. So the other two might be Neutral and maybe CoCoGM. Wait, CoCoGM is comparing goals or methods, which isn't the case here. 

Therefore, the top three are CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral if there's no other subclass. But the passage is clearly a comparison of results. So CoCoRes is the only applicable one. However, the task requires three classes. Hmm. Maybe the example is CoCoRes, and the other two could be Neutral and maybe CoCoXY. But CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies. Since the citation is only one study here, CoCoXY isn't applicable. Therefore, the top three would be CoCoRes first, then Neutral if there's a neutral mention elsewhere, but in this case, the context is directly contrasting results. Maybe the answer is CoCoRes, then Neutral and CoCoXY. Wait, no. The example given for CoCoRes is exactly matching, so CoCoRes is first. The other two might be Neutral and maybe CoCoGM or CoCoXY, but I don't see them applying here. Since the task requires three, perhaps CoCoRes is first, then Neutral, then CoCoXY as the third. But I'm not sure. Maybe the correct answer is CoCoRes first, then Neutral, then CoCoGM. But I think CoCoRes is the only one here. Wait, the example for CoCoRes is "substantially differ from the results of the experiments... @@CITATION@@", which matches the given passage exactly. So CoCoRes is definitely first. The other two might be Neutral and maybe CoCoXY, but CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies. Since there's only one citation here, CoCoXY isn't applicable. Therefore, the top three would be CoCoRes, Neutral, and maybe CoCoGM. But CoCoGM is about goals or methods, which isn't the case here. So maybe Neutral is the second, but Neutral is when it's just stating facts without comparison. Wait, the example for Neutral is "In the USA... @@CITATION@@", which is a neutral statement. In the given passage, it's contrasting results, so Neutral isn't the case. Therefore, maybe the correct answer is CoCoRes first, then maybe CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two cited works, but here it's between current work and one cited work. Therefore, the top three are CoCoRes, then Neutral, then CoCoGM. But I'm not confident. Wait, the task requires exactly three, so perhaps CoCoRes is first, then maybe Neutral and CoCoXY as the other two. But the passage doesn't have Neutral or CoCoXY elements. Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is CoCoRes first, Neutral second, and CoCoGM third. But Neutral doesn't apply here. This is confusing. Let me check the definitions again. CoCoRes is comparison of results between current work and cited work. The example matches the given passage exactly. Therefore, CoCoRes is the primary. The other two might be Neutral and CoCoXY, but since there's no comparison between two cited works, CoCoXY isn't applicable. Neutral isn't applicable here because the citation is used in a comparative context. Wait, Neutral is when it's just descriptive. So maybe the correct answer is CoCoRes first, then Neutral third, but Neutral isn't fitting. Hmm. Maybe the answer is CoCoRes, then maybe CoCoGM and CoCoXY as the other two, but they don't apply here. Therefore, the top three are CoCoRes, Neutral, and CoCoXY. But Neutral isn't right. Maybe the correct answer is CoCoRes first, then maybe CoCoXY and Neutral. Wait, the example given for CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies. Since the given passage is comparing current work to cited work, CoCoXY isn't applicable. Therefore, the top three are CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral and CoCoGM. But CoCoGM isn't applicable. Hmm. This is tricky. I think the correct answer is CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral and CoCoXY as the other two, even if they don't perfectly fit, but given the task requires three, perhaps the answer is CoCoRes, Neutral, CoCoXY.
