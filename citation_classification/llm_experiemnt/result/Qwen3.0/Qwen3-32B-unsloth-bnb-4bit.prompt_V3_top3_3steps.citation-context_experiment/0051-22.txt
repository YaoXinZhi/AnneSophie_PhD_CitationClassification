Okay, let's tackle this classification problem step by step. First, I need to understand the context around the citation marked @@CITATION@@. The passage says, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." 

So the key part here is that the current study's results are different from those cited. The example given for CoCoRes is similar: comparing results of the cited work with the citing paper. That fits because the sentence directly contrasts their findings. 

Next, the general intent here is comparative, specifically comparing results. The main rhetorical class here would be CoCoRes. Are there other possible classes? Maybe Neutral if it's just stating facts without comparison, but the example clearly uses "substantially differ," which is a direct comparison. 

Looking at other classes, CoCoXY is about comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies, which isn't the case here. CoCoGM is about goals or methods, which isn't mentioned. Support or Similar don't fit because they're talking about differences. Motivation or Future aren't present here. Weakness would imply criticism, but the sentence is neutral in that regard, just stating a difference. 

So the top class is definitely CoCoRes. The next could be Neutral if the citation is just providing background, but the example for Neutral is more about stating facts without direct comparison. However, in this case, the comparison is explicit. Wait, maybe Neutral isn't the second here. Let me check the definitions again. 

The example for Neutral is something like stating a fact without supporting or comparing. Here, the citation is used to compare results, so Neutral might not be appropriate. Maybe the next could be CoCoGM or something else, but the example given for CoCoRes is almost identical. 

Wait, the example given for CoCoRes is "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." That's exactly the same as the user's example. So the top class is CoCoRes. 

For the second and third, maybe Neutral if there's no other intent. But since the citation is directly comparing results, maybe the next could be Basis if it's foundational, but the example for Basis is about introducing a method. Here, it's about differing results, so Basis isn't right. 

Alternatively, maybe Weakness if the cited work's results are being contrasted as a limitation, but the sentence doesn't criticize the cited work, just states a difference. So Weakness might not fit. 

Therefore, the top three would be CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral if there's no other intent, but I'm not sure. Wait, the example for Neutral is "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@", which is a factual statement without comparison. Here, the citation is part of a comparison, so Neutral isn't applicable. 

Hmm, perhaps only CoCoRes is the main one, but the task asks for three. Maybe the second is Neutral? Or maybe there's another layer. Wait, maybe the citation is also providing a basis for the current study's comparison, but that's stretching it. Alternatively, maybe the citation is supporting the claim that there's a difference, but Support is when the cited work supports the current findings. Here, it's the opposite. 

I think the only applicable class here is CoCoRes. But the task requires three. Maybe the example given in the problem is the same as the example for CoCoRes, so the top three would be CoCoRes, then Neutral, then maybe Basis? Wait, no. Let me check the definitions again. 

Wait, the example given in the problem is the same as the CoCoRes example. So the correct classification is CoCoRes as the first. Since the task requires three, perhaps Neutral is the second and third? But why? Maybe the citation is also providing background information, but the primary intent is CoCoRes. 

Alternatively, maybe there's no second or third, but the instructions say to provide three. Maybe the user expects Neutral as the second and third. But I'm not sure. Let me think again. 

The sentence is stating that their results differ from those in the cited work. That's a direct comparison of results. So CoCoRes is first. There's no other clear intent here. Maybe Neutral is not applicable. However, the instructions require three classes, so perhaps the next two are Neutral and something else. But I'm not seeing it. 

Wait, maybe the citation is also used to support the claim that there are differing results, but that's part of CoCoRes. Alternatively, maybe Weakness if the cited work's results are considered incomplete, but the sentence doesn't state that. 

Given the strict definitions, the only applicable class is CoCoRes. However, the example in the problem is the same as the CoCoRes example. Therefore, the top three would be CoCoRes, then Neutral, then maybe Basis. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is CoCoRes, then Neutral, then CoCoGM. But I don't see any mention of goals or methods. 

Given the strict example provided, the correct answer is CoCoRes as the first. The second and third might be Neutral and something else, but I'm forced to pick three. Since the example in the problem matches CoCoRes exactly, the answer is CoCoRes first. The other two might be Neutral and Basis, but I'm not certain. 

Wait, the user's instruction says to return exactly three rhetorical class labels ranked from most to least appropriate. Given that the example matches CoCoRes perfectly, the first is CoCoRes. The second could be Neutral if the citation is also providing background, but the primary intent is CoCoRes. Maybe Neutral is not applicable here. Alternatively, perhaps the citation is also used to support the current claim of differing results, but that's part of CoCoRes. 

Given that the instructions require three, and the example is a perfect match for CoCoRes, I'll go with CoCoRes as 1, then Neutral as 2 and Basis as 3. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe Neutral isn't applicable here. 

Wait, the Neutral example is when the citation is used in a neutral descriptive way. Here, the citation is part of a comparison, so Neutral isn't the right class. Therefore, maybe the only correct class is CoCoRes, and the other two are not applicable. But the task requires three. Hmm. Maybe there's a mistake here. 

Alternatively, perhaps the citation is also providing a basis for the current study's comparison, making Basis the second. But the example for Basis is about introducing a method. This isn't that. 

Given the strict definitions and examples, the only correct class is CoCoRes. However, since the task requires three, maybe Neutral and Basis are added as lower ranks, even if they don't fit perfectly. But I'm not confident. 

In conclusion, based on the example provided, the correct answer is CoCoRes as the first, then Neutral, then maybe Basis. But I'm not certain about the latter two. Given the strict example, I'll proceed with CoCoRes as the top, and then perhaps Neutral and Basis as the next two, even if they might not fit perfectly.
