Okay, let me try to work through this step by step. First, I need to look at the passage where the citation is mentioned. The citation is tagged as @@CITATION@@, so I'll focus on that part.

The sentence around the citation says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." 

So the context here is comparing the results of the current study with those from the cited work. The key phrase is "substantially differ," which indicates a direct comparison between the two sets of results. 

Looking at the rhetorical classes, CoCoRes is for comparing results. That seems like the primary class here because the authors are contrasting their findings with the cited experiments. 

Next, maybe CoCoXY? Wait, CoCoXY is for comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies, not with the current paper. Since this is comparing the current results with the cited results, it's CoCoRes. 

Is there another possible class? Maybe Neutral? But the sentence is making a direct comparison, so Neutral doesn't fit. Support would be if they're confirming the cited work, but here it's a contrast. Weakness would be if they're pointing out flaws, but it's just a difference in results. 

So the main one is CoCoRes. What about the second? The example given for CoCoRes includes a direct comparison like this. The other possible could be Basis if the cited work is foundational, but the sentence doesn't mention that. 

Wait, maybe CoCoGM? But CoCoGM is about comparing goals or methods. The sentence is about results, so CoCoRes is more accurate. 

Third class could be Neutral, but the example given for Neutral is more descriptive without a specific argument. Since the authors are directly contrasting results, Neutral might not be the best third. Maybe Future or Motivation? Doesn't seem so. 

So the top three would be CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral if there's any descriptive element, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe CoCoXY if they're comparing two studies, but the example for CoCoXY involves comparing two cited studies with each other. Here, it's comparing the current work with the cited work. 

Therefore, the primary is CoCoRes, then perhaps Neutral if the rest of the sentence is just stating a fact without further argument. But the example for Neutral is a straightforward citation without comparison. Since the comparison is direct between current and cited results, Neutral isn't the case. 

Wait, maybe CoCoXY isn't right here. So the top three would be CoCoRes as first, then maybe Basis if the cited work is foundational, but the example for Basis is about introducing a method. Here, the cited work's results are being compared, not their foundation. 

Hmm. Maybe CoCoRes is the only relevant one, but the instructions say to pick three. Maybe Neutral is the third? Let me check the example again. Neutral example is when the citation is used descriptively without supporting or comparing. In this case, the citation is used to contrast results, so Neutral isn't appropriate. 

Wait, maybe Weakness? If the cited results are being contrasted and perhaps considered less valid. But the example for Weakness includes pointing out problematic taxonomic status. Here, the authors just state their results differ. Unless the cited results are considered flawed, but the sentence doesn't say that. 

So perhaps CoCoRes is first, then maybe CoCoXY if there's an implicit comparison between two cited studies, but the sentence only mentions one citation. So CoCoXY requires comparing two cited studies. Therefore, CoCoXY isn't applicable here. 

So the top three would be CoCoRes, then maybe Neutral, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the third is Basis if the cited work is foundational. But the example for Basis is introducing a method. 

This is tricky. Maybe the correct answer is CoCoRes as the primary, then Neutral as the second if the citation is just stating a fact, but I'm not certain. Wait, the example for CoCoRes includes "substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted... @@CITATION@@", which matches the given sentence. So CoCoRes is definitely first. 

For the second, maybe CoCoGM if the cited work's methods are different. But the sentence mentions results, not methods. So CoCoGM is out. 

Third could be Neutral, but the example for Neutral is more like a descriptive citation without a direct comparison. Since this is a direct comparison, Neutral might not fit. Alternatively, maybe the third is CoCoXY if the cited work is part of a comparison with another study, but the sentence only references one citation. 

I think the correct top three are CoCoRes as first, then maybe Neutral as second, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe there's another class. Wait, the example for CoCoRes includes a direct comparison of results, so that's first. Then maybe CoCoGM if the methods are compared implicitly. But the sentence doesn't mention methods. 

Hmm. Given the example provided in the user's prompt, the correct answer is CoCoRes first. The second and third might be CoCoXY or Neutral, but given the example for CoCoXY involves comparing two cited studies with each other, which isn't the case here. So maybe CoCoRes is the only relevant one, but the instructions require three. 

Wait, perhaps the third is Neutral. Let me check the example again. Neutral example: "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@." That's a straightforward statement without a direct comparison. In the given sentence, the citation is used to contrast results, so Neutral isn't appropriate. 

Therefore, maybe the third is CoCoXY, even though the example isn't matching perfectly. Alternatively, maybe the third is Basis. But the example for Basis is introducing a method. 

Given the confusion, I'll stick with CoCoRes as the primary, then maybe CoCoXY if there's an implicit comparison between the cited study and others mentioned. Wait, the sentence mentions "experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." So maybe the cited work is one of several studies using those targets, and the authors are comparing their results with those studies. But the example for CoCoRes includes a single citation. 

I think the correct answer is CoCoRes as the first class. The second and third might be CoCoXY and Neutral, but given the example for CoCoXY requires comparing two cited studies, which isn't the case here. Therefore, perhaps the top three are CoCoRes, then Neutral, then maybe CoCoGM. But I'm not confident. 

Wait, looking back, the user's example for CoCoRes is exactly matching the given sentence structure. So CoCoRes is definitely first. The second could be CoCoGM if there's a method comparison, but the sentence mentions results. Therefore, maybe the third is Neutral. 

But the Neutral example is a descriptive citation without a direct comparison. Since the given sentence is a direct comparison, Neutral isn't correct. 

Hmm. Maybe the third is Basis if the cited work is foundational. But the example for Basis is introducing a method. 

This is confusing. Given the instructions, perhaps the answer is CoCoRes first, then maybe CoCoXY if the cited work is part of a comparison with another study, but the sentence only cites one. 

I think the correct answer is CoCoRes as the primary class. The second and third might not be applicable, but since the instructions require three, maybe Neutral and CoCoGM as lower ranks. But I'm not sure. Given the example provided, I'll proceed with CoCoRes as first, then Neutral as second, and CoCoXY as third, even if it's not perfect.
