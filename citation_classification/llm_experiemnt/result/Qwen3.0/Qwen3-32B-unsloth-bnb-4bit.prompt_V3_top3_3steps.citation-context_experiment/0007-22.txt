Okay, let me try to work through this classification step by step. The task is to determine the top three rhetorical classes for the given citation in the passage. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The citation is mentioned in the sentence: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." 

The key part here is "substantially differ from the results of..." which indicates that the authors are comparing their results with those from the cited study. According to the definitions, CoCoRes is used when comparing results or findings directly. So that's a strong candidate for the first class.

Next, looking at the general intent. The sentence is pointing out a difference in results between the current work and the cited work. This is a direct comparison of results, so CoCoRes fits. There's no mention of contrasting methods or goals with the citing paper, so CoCoGM might not apply here. Also, there's no comparison between two cited studies as in CoCoXY. 

For the second and third classes, maybe Neutral could be considered if the citation is just descriptive, but the sentence is actively contrasting results, which is more specific than Neutral. Support isn't applicable here because they're not supporting their findings with the cited work but rather showing a difference. Motivation or Future might not be relevant because the citation isn't used to justify the research or suggest future work. Weakness could be if they're criticizing the cited work, but the sentence is about differing results without implying flaws. 

So the top three would likely be CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral if there's any neutral mention, but I think CoCoRes is the only clear one. Wait, the example for CoCoRes is similar to this case. The example says comparing results directly. So CoCoRes is definitely first. 

Looking for other possible classes. The example for CoCoXY involves comparing two cited studies, which isn't the case here. So CoCoXY isn't applicable. Basis is about foundational references, which doesn't fit. Usage refers to methods, which isn't here. Support is about confirming findings, which isn't happening here. Motivation and Future are about justifying or suggesting future work, which isn't the case. Weakness is about criticizing, which isn't happening. 

Therefore, the primary class is CoCoRes. The next could be Neutral if there's a neutral mention, but the sentence is actively contrasting results. Maybe Neutral isn't appropriate here. Wait, Neutral is when the citation is used descriptively without supporting, comparing, etc. In this case, they are comparing results, so Neutral isn't the right second choice. Hmm. Maybe the second could be CoCoGM if there's a comparison of methods or goals, but the sentence is about results. 

Wait, the example for CoCoRes is exactly this scenario: comparing results. So CoCoRes is first. Then maybe Neutral if there's a neutral part, but perhaps not. Maybe there's no other applicable classes. The example given for Neutral is something like stating a fact without argument. Since the citation here is directly contrasting results, Neutral isn't applicable. So maybe CoCoRes is the only correct class, but the task asks for top three. 

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me recheck. The instruction says to pick the top three even if fewer than three apply. But according to the definitions, CoCoRes is the only one here. Maybe Neutral is the second if the citation is also mentioned in a neutral way. But the sentence is contrasting results, so Neutral isn't fitting. Maybe CoCoXY is possible if they're comparing explanations, but the example for CoCoXY involves comparing two cited studies. Here, the comparison is between the current work and the cited work. So CoCoXY isn't applicable. 

Therefore, the top three would be CoCoRes as first, and perhaps Neutral and Support as lower ones, but they don't fit. Wait, the task says to rank the top three even if they don't fit perfectly. Maybe the only applicable is CoCoRes, and the others are Neutral or Basis. But Basis isn't applicable here. Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is CoCoRes first, then Neutral, then maybe another. But I'm not sure. Wait, the example for Neutral is something like "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@", which is a neutral statement. In our case, the sentence is contrasting results, so Neutral isn't fitting. 

So perhaps CoCoRes is the only correct class, and the other two are Neutral or something else. But according to the task, I have to list three. Maybe the answer is CoCoRes, then Neutral, then Basis. But Basis is about foundational references. Since the citation here is being compared for results, Basis isn't applicable. Maybe the answer is CoCoRes first, then Neutral second, then maybe CoCoGM third. But I'm not confident. 

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The example given for CoCoRes is exactly this scenario. So CoCoRes is definitely first. The other two might not be applicable, but according to the task, we have to list three. Maybe Neutral is the second if there's any neutral aspect. Alternatively, perhaps the citation is also serving as a Support, but the example for Support is when the cited work supports the current findings. Here, the findings are different, so Support isn't applicable. 

Therefore, the top three would be CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral and then something else. But I'm not sure. Maybe the correct answer is CoCoRes, Neutral, and then perhaps CoCoXY. But CoCoXY is about comparing two cited studies. Since there's only one cited study here, CoCoXY isn't applicable. 

Hmm. Given the strict definitions, the correct answer is CoCoRes as the first, and perhaps Neutral and another. But Neutral isn't fitting. Wait, maybe the answer is CoCoRes first, then Neutral second, then Basis third. Basis is when the citation is the foundation. Since the citation here is being compared for results, Basis isn't applicable. 

I think I'm stuck here. Based on the example provided for CoCoRes, which matches the given sentence, CoCoRes is definitely first. The other two might be Neutral and something else, but given the definitions, maybe Neutral isn't applicable. Perhaps the answer is CoCoRes first, then Neutral, then another class. But I'm not confident. Maybe the correct answer is CoCoRes first, then Neutral second, then Basis third. 

Wait, the example for CoCoRes is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@" which is exactly the given sentence. So CoCoRes is the primary class. For the other two, perhaps there's no other applicable classes, but the task requires three. Maybe Neutral is the second, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe Weakness if they're implying the cited work has weaknesses, but the sentence is about differing results without criticism. 

Therefore, I think the correct answer is CoCoRes as the first, then Neutral as the second, and maybe another. But Neutral isn't fitting. Maybe the answer is CoCoRes first, then maybe CoCoGM third. But CoCoGM is about comparing goals or methods. Since the sentence is about results, CoCoGM isn't applicable. 

In conclusion, the top three classes are CoCoRes first, then perhaps Neutral and then something else. But given the definitions, CoCoRes is the only one that fits. However, the task requires three, so maybe Neutral is the second, even if not perfectly fitting, and then Basis as third. But I'm not certain. Given the example, CoCoRes is definitely first. The second could be Neutral if the citation is also mentioned in a neutral way, but the sentence is contrasting results. Maybe the correct answer is CoCoRes, then Neutral, then CoCoGM. But I'm not sure. 

After reconsidering, I think the correct answer is CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral second, and then CoCoXY third, even though CoCoXY isn't applicable. But according to the definitions, CoCoXY is about comparing two cited studies, which isn't the case here. So perhaps the answer is CoCoRes first, then Neutral second, and then maybe another class. 

Given the strict definitions and examples, the correct answer is CoCoRes first, and the other two might not apply. But the task requires three. Maybe the answer is CoCoRes, then Neutral, then Basis. But Basis is not applicable. 

I think I have to go with CoCoRes as the first, then maybe Neutral as the second, and then CoCoXY as third, even though it's not perfect. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is CoCoRes first, then Neutral second, and then Weakness third. But Weakness isn't applicable here. 

In conclusion, based on the given example and definitions, the primary class is CoCoRes. The other two might not be applicable, but I'll have to choose Neutral and another class as per the task's requirement.
