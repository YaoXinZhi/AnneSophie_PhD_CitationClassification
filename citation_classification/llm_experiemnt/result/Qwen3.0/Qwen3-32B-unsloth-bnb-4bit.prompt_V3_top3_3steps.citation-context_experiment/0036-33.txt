Okay, let's start by looking at the context around the citation marked @@CITATION@@. The passage says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." 

So the author is comparing their current results with those from previous experiments that used different metal targets. The key here is the direct comparison between the current study's results and the cited work's results.

Now, looking at the general intent, this seems like a Comparative intent, specifically comparing results. According to the step-by-step guide, Comparative falls under CoCoRes when directly comparing findings. 

Next, checking the examples for CoCoRes: the example given is very similar to the context here. Both mention differing results between the current work and the cited study. 

Other possible classes might include CoCoXY if they were comparing explanations between two cited studies, but in this case, it's a direct comparison between the current work and the cited one, so CoCoRes is more accurate. There's no mention of goals or methods here, so CoCoGM isn't applicable. The citation isn't used to support or motivate the current research either. 

So the top three classes would be CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral if there's no other intent, but the primary intent is clearly CoCoRes. The second and third might be Neutral or Basis, but given the context, Neutral seems less likely here because the comparison is explicit. Wait, maybe CoCoXY if comparing explanations, but the example there involves two cited studies compared to each other, not the current work. So definitely CoCoRes is the main one. The next could be Support if the cited work is being referenced to back up something, but in this case, they're contrasting results, so Support isn't right. Maybe Weakness if the cited work's results are being criticized, but the passage just states that the results differ, not that they're flawed. So Weakness might not be correct either. 

Therefore, the top three are CoCoRes, then perhaps Neutral if there's no other intent, but given the direct comparison, CoCoRes is first. The other two might be CoCoXY or Basis, but since the example is a direct result comparison, CoCoRes is the primary, and maybe Neutral as a secondary if there's no other intent. But I think the main one is CoCoRes, then maybe nothing else applies. Wait, the user requires three classes. Maybe CoCoRes is first, then CoCoXY if there's a comparison between explanations, but in this case, it's results. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe CoCoRes is first, then Basis if the cited work is foundational, but the example given in Basis is about introducing a method, which isn't the case here. So perhaps CoCoRes is first, then Neutral as the second, and maybe CoCoGM as third if there's any method comparison, but the passage doesn't mention methods. So the top three would be CoCoRes, Neutral, and maybe CoCoXY if there's an indirect comparison. Wait, the example for CoCoXY involves comparing two cited studies with each other, not the current work. Since this is comparing the current work to the cited one, CoCoRes is correct. The other two might be Neutral or Basis. Since there's no indication of foundation or motivation, Neutral could be second if the citation is just descriptive. But the example given for Neutral is more about stating facts without argument. Here, it's a direct comparison of results, so Neutral might not fit. Maybe the second is CoCoXY if there's an implicit comparison of explanations, but the text says results differ, not explanations. Therefore, the top three are CoCoRes, then maybe Weakness if there's criticism, but the text doesn't criticize, just states differences. So perhaps CoCoRes is the only one applicable, but the task requires three. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me recheck the definitions. CoCoRes is for direct comparison between current and cited results. The example matches. So first is CoCoRes. The second could be Neutral if there's no other intent. The third might be CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two cited studies, but the example here is only one cited study compared to the current work. So perhaps Neutral is third. Wait, but Neutral is when the citation is descriptive without argument. Maybe the second could be Support if the cited work is being referenced to back up something else, but here it's contrasting. Alternatively, maybe CoCoGM if there's a method difference, but the text mentions results. So I think the correct order is CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral as second, and then Basis as third if there's any foundation reference, but the text doesn't indicate that. Wait, the Basis example is about introducing a method. Since this citation is about comparing results, Basis isn't relevant. So maybe Neutral is third. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps CoCoRes is first, then CoCoXY if there's an indirect comparison, but the example for CoCoXY is between two cited studies. So perhaps CoCoRes is first, then maybe nothing else applies, but the task requires three. Maybe the user expects three, even if some are less certain. So perhaps CoCoRes, then Neutral, then Basis. But I'm not confident about Neutral and Basis here. Alternatively, maybe CoCoRes, then CoCoGM if there's any mention of methods, but the text doesn't mention methods. So I'll stick with CoCoRes as first, then Neutral as second, and maybe CoCoXY as third if there's a comparison of explanations, but the text doesn't mention explanations. Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is CoCoRes first, then Neutral second, and then Basis third, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe CoCoRes is first, then CoCoXY third if the comparison is between explanations. Wait, the example for CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies, but here it's comparing current work to cited. So maybe CoCoRes is first, then maybe nothing else applies, but the user wants three. Maybe Neutral is second because the citation is descriptive, but the example for Neutral is more about stating facts without argument. In this case, the citation is used to compare results, so Neutral might not fit. Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here. Let me look at the example again. The example for CoCoRes is "substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted...", which matches the given context. So CoCoRes is definitely first. For the second and third, maybe Neutral is appropriate if there's no other intent. Alternatively, maybe CoCoXY is third if there's an implicit comparison between explanations, but the text doesn't mention explanations. So perhaps Neutral is second and third. Wait, but Neutral is only one class. Maybe the user expects three distinct classes. Since the context is a direct comparison of results, CoCoRes is first. The other two might be CoCoXY and Neutral if applicable, but I'm not sure. Given the strict instructions, I'll proceed with CoCoRes as the top, then maybe Neutral as second, and then CoCoGM as third if there's any mention of goals or methods, but the text doesn't mention methods. So perhaps Neutral is third. Wait, but Neutral is only one class. Maybe the correct answer is CoCoRes, then maybe nothing else, but the user requires three. I think the safest answer here is CoCoRes first, then Neutral second, and then Basis third, even if it's a stretch. Alternatively, maybe CoCoRes is first, then CoCoXY third if the comparison is between explanations. But the example for CoCoXY involves two cited studies compared to each other, not the current work. Therefore, the correct top three are CoCoRes, then maybe Neutral, and then Basis. But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, maybe CoCoRes is the only relevant class, and the other two are Neutral and something else. Hmm. Let me conclude that the top three are CoCoRes, then Neutral, then CoCoGM, even though CoCoGM isn't directly applicable here. But given the task requires three, I'll proceed with that.
