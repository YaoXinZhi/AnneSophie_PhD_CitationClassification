Okay, let's start by looking at the given passage. The citation is in the sentence: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The key part here is the comparison between the current study's results and those from previous experiments using specific deuterium targets. The phrase "substantially differ" indicates that the authors are contrasting their findings with the cited work's results.

Next, determining the general intent. Since they're directly comparing results, this points towards a Comparative intent. According to the task guidelines, Comparative falls under CoCoRes when it's about results. 

Now, looking at the specific classes. The example given for CoCoRes matches this scenario exactly. The authors mention differing results from the cited study, which fits CoCoRes as the primary class. 

For secondary classes, maybe there's a Neutral aspect since they're just stating the difference without further analysis. Also, perhaps CoCoXY if they're contrasting explanations, but the example here doesn't mention comparing two cited studies with each other. 

So the top classes would be CoCoRes first, then Neutral, and maybe CoCoGM if there's a method comparison. Wait, the cited work's methods involve different targets, but the comparison here is about results. So CoCoRes is primary. Neutral might come in as the citation is just stating a difference without supporting or motivating further. 

Therefore, the top three would be CoCoRes, Neutral, and possibly CoCoGM if methods are compared. But the example focuses on results. So CoCoRes is first, Neutral second, and maybe CoCoXY if contrasting two studies, but the example here is between current and cited work. So Neutral might be third. Hmm, maybe Weakness isn't here since they're not criticizing the cited work. 

Finalizing: 1. CoCoRes, 2. Neutral, 3. CoCoGM.

1. CoCoRes  
2. Neutral  
3. CoCoGM
