Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to look at the citation marked @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. The task is to determine the top three rhetorical classes from the provided list based on the context around the citation.

Starting with Step 1: Extracting the context. The example given in the instructions mentions a sentence where the citation is used to compare results with another study. The specific example was about results differing from experiments with deuterium targets. So, in the user's case, I need to find the sentence where @@CITATION@@ is placed and note the surrounding text that explains its use.

Next, Step 2 is identifying the general intent. The example given for CoCoRes was comparing results directly. If the citation is used to contrast findings between the current work and the cited study, then the intent would be comparative in terms of results. If the authors mention similarities, that might fall under Similar. If they're using the citation to support their own findings, it could be Support.

Looking at the example in the user's problem, if the citation is in a sentence like "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@", then the intent is clearly comparative regarding results, which maps to CoCoRes. 

Then Step 3 involves ranking the top three classes. The primary one would be CoCoRes. If there's also a mention of contrasting explanations between two cited studies without involving the current paper, that might be CoCoXY. If the context is purely descriptive without any direct comparison or support, Neutral might come in third. However, based on the example provided, the main class is CoCoRes, and if there's no other clear secondary classes mentioned, maybe CoCoXY and Neutral follow based on the examples given.

So, considering the example given in the instructions for CoCoRes, the top three would be CoCoRes first, then possibly CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two studies, and Neutral if the citation is just mentioned without any specific argument. However, in the given example, it's a direct comparison of results, so CoCoRes is the primary, and others might not apply unless additional context is present. But since the user's example is hypothetical, following the structure provided, the answer would be CoCoRes as the main class, then maybe CoCoXY if there's a mention of conflicting results between two studies, and Neutral if there's no direct argumentation.
