Okay, let's start by looking at the passage provided. The citation is mentioned in the sentence: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@."

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The key part here is that the authors are comparing their results with those from previous experiments that used deuterium-saturated metal targets. The phrase "substantially differ" indicates a direct comparison of results.

Next, determining the general intent. Since the citation is used to compare the current results with those from the cited work, this falls under comparative intent. According to the guidelines, comparative intent corresponds to CoCoRes, CoCoGM, or CoCoXY. 

Looking at the example for CoCoRes: the citation is used to compare results or findings directly. The given example matches the structure where the present work's results are contrasted with the cited experiments. Therefore, CoCoRes is the primary class here.

For secondary classes, maybe there's a neutral aspect if the citation is just stating the existence of prior results without deeper comparison, but the primary focus is on the difference in results. There might also be a Basis if the cited work is foundational, but the sentence is more about differing results than establishing a foundation. 

So the top three would be CoCoRes first, then perhaps Neutral if the citation is just referencing prior work without additional context beyond the comparison. Maybe CoCoXY isn't applicable here because it's comparing the cited work's results with the current paper's, not two cited studies. So Neutral might be third if there's a mention without further analysis, but the main intent is CoCoRes. Alternatively, maybe Support if they're using the cited work to highlight their own findings, but the wording is about differences, not support. 

Therefore, the top three are CoCoRes, then maybe Neutral if the citation is just descriptive, and perhaps Basis if the cited work is foundational but the primary use here is comparison of results. Wait, the Basis is for foundational references. Since the cited work's results are being compared, Basis might not apply here. So Neutral could be secondary if the citation is just providing context. But the example given for Neutral is more about stating facts without argument. In this case, the citation is used to show a contrast, which is CoCoRes. So the top three would be CoCoRes, then maybe Neutral as a secondary, and perhaps CoCoGM if there's a mention of methods, but the example here is about results. 

So finalizing: CoCoRes is first, then Neutral if the citation is just referencing prior results without further argument, and perhaps Weakness if the cited work's results are being contrasted as flawed, but the example here says "substantially differ" which might not imply weakness unless the cited results are considered incorrect. Since the passage doesn't state that the cited results are wrong, just different, Weakness might not apply. Therefore, Neutral could be third if the citation is just providing a factual reference without critique or support beyond the comparison.
