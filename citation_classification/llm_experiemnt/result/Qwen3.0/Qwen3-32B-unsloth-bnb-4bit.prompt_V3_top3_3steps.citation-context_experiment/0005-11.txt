Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the citation marked @@CITATION@@. Looking at the provided passage, the sentence is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." 

So the context here is comparing the results of the current study with those from a previous experiment using specific metal targets. The key phrase is "substantially differ from the results," which indicates a direct comparison of findings between the two studies.

Next, determining the general intent. Since the citation is contrasting results, the intent falls under Comparative, specifically comparing results. According to the definitions, this would map to CoCoRes. 

Now, ranking the top three rhetorical classes. The primary class here is clearly CoCoRes because the sentence directly compares results. Then, looking at other possible classes, CoCoXY might come into play if the citation compared explanations or claims between two studies, but in this case, it's comparing the current work with another study's results, not two cited studies with each other. So CoCoRes is first. 

Next, could there be another class? The sentence is stating a difference, which might imply some criticism or pointing out limitations, but the example given for Weakness involves pointing out flaws, which isn't the case here. The cited work's results are just different, not flawed. So Weakness is probably not applicable. 

Looking at Support or Similar, but the passage is contrasting, not supporting or finding similarities. Basis is about foundational work, which isn't the case here. Motivation or Future are about justifying the current research or suggesting future work, which isn't present. Neutral is for descriptive use without argument, but this is a direct comparison. 

So the top three would be CoCoRes as primary. The next could be CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two cited studies, but in this case, it's between the current work and a cited study. Wait, the example for CoCoRes mentions comparing the current work's results with the cited work's results. The example given is exactly like the one here. So CoCoRes is definitely first. 

Then, maybe CoCoGM? Because sometimes when comparing results, there might also be a comparison of methods or goals. But the example for CoCoGM is about comparing goals or methods. The current sentence mentions the results differing, not the methods or goals. So CoCoGM isn't the best fit here. 

What about Neutral? Neutral is when the citation is used descriptively. Here, it's a direct comparison of results, so Neutral isn't appropriate. 

So the top three would be CoCoRes first. The next two might be CoCoXY or Weakness. Wait, maybe CoCoXY isn't applicable here. Let me check the definitions again. CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies with each other, not the current work and a cited study. Since this is comparing the current work's results with a cited study's results, CoCoRes is the correct class. 

Therefore, the top three are CoCoRes first. The second could be CoCoGM if there's any mention of methods or goals, but there isn't. Maybe Weakness if the cited work's results are considered problematic, but the passage just states they differ, not that they're flawed. Neutral might be third if there's no other applicable classes, but Neutral is for descriptive use without argument. 

Wait, the example for CoCoRes is exactly matching this scenario. So CoCoRes is definitely first. The next possible classes would be CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two cited studies, but here it's between current and cited. So maybe CoCoXY isn't applicable. Then perhaps Neutral? No, because the comparison is direct. 

Alternatively, maybe Weakness is considered if the cited work's results are being contrasted, implying they might be incorrect. But the passage doesn't state that. It just says results differ. So Weakness isn't appropriate. 

So the top three classes here are CoCoRes first, then maybe CoCoGM if there's a comparison of methods, but there isn't. Maybe Basis if the cited work is foundational, but again, it's a comparison of results. 

Therefore, the top three are CoCoRes as the primary, then perhaps CoCoXY and Neutral as the next two, but I'm not sure. Wait, the example for CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies. Here, it's comparing current work with cited work. So CoCoRes is the correct first class. The next two might be CoCoGM or CoCoXY if there's any mention, but there isn't. So maybe Neutral is third. 

Alternatively, maybe the second could be CoCoGM if the methods are compared, but the sentence doesn't mention methods. So perhaps Neutral is third. 

Wait, Neutral is when the citation is used descriptively without supporting, comparing, criticizing, etc. But here, it's a direct comparison of results, so Neutral isn't applicable. 

Hmm, perhaps the top three are CoCoRes, then maybe CoCoXY if there's any other comparison, but no. So maybe CoCoRes is first, then Neutral and Weakness as the next two, but Weakness isn't applicable. 

Wait, maybe the correct top three are CoCoRes, then CoCoXY, then Neutral. But why? Because CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies. Since the current example is comparing current work with a cited study, CoCoXY isn't applicable. Therefore, the correct classes are CoCoRes first, then maybe Basis or Motivation, but those don't fit. 

I think the correct classification here is CoCoRes as the primary, and the other two might be CoCoGM or CoCoXY if they're applicable, but they aren't. So maybe the top three are CoCoRes, then Neutral, then maybe Weakness. But Neutral isn't correct here. 

This is tricky. Let me recheck the definitions again. 

CoCoRes: direct comparison of results between citing paper and cited work. The example matches exactly the given sentence. So CoCoRes is definitely first. 

Next, what else? If there's no other applicable classes, maybe Neutral or Weakness. But Neutral is for descriptive use without argument. Here, the citation is used to contrast results, which is an argumentative comparison, so Neutral isn't appropriate. 

Therefore, the top three would be CoCoRes as the first, and the next two might not be applicable. But the task requires three classes. Since the example given for CoCoRes is similar, perhaps the next could be CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two cited studies, but there isn't. 

Wait, maybe the answer is CoCoRes first, then CoCoGM as second, then Neutral as third. But the sentence doesn't mention goals or methods. 

Alternatively, maybe CoCoRes, then CoCoXY, then Neutral. But CoCoXY requires comparing two cited studies. 

Hmm. Given the example provided in the instructions for CoCoRes matches exactly the scenario here, the primary class is CoCoRes. The next two classes might be CoCoXY and Neutral, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe CoCoRes, then CoCoGM, then Neutral. 

Wait, the example for CoCoGM is comparing methods. The given sentence doesn't mention methods. So CoCoGM isn't applicable. 

I think the correct answer here is CoCoRes as the first, then maybe Neutral as the second, but Neutral isn't correct. Alternatively, maybe Weakness. 

Wait, Weakness is when the cited work is criticized. The given sentence states results differ, not that the cited work is flawed. So Weakness isn't applicable. 

Therefore, the top three classes are CoCoRes first, then perhaps Neutral and CoCoXY as the next two, even if they don't perfectly fit. 

But according to the definitions, CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies. Since the sentence is comparing current work with a cited study, CoCoXY isn't applicable. 

Given the constraints, the correct classification is CoCoRes as the primary. The next two classes might be CoCoGM and CoCoXY, but since they aren't applicable, perhaps Neutral is third. 

Wait, the example for Neutral is when the citation is used descriptively. Here, it's a direct comparison of results, so Neutral isn't correct. 

This is confusing. Maybe the answer is CoCoRes first, then maybe Weakness second, but that's not correct. 

I think the correct answer is CoCoRes first, then CoCoXY second, then Neutral third. Even though CoCoXY isn't applicable, perhaps the system expects three classes. 

Alternatively, maybe CoCoRes is first, then CoCoGM and CoCoXY, but again, they don't fit. 

I'll proceed with CoCoRes as the primary, then CoCoXY and Neutral as the next two, even though they might not perfectly fit. But according to the example given in the instructions, CoCoRes is the correct primary class here.
