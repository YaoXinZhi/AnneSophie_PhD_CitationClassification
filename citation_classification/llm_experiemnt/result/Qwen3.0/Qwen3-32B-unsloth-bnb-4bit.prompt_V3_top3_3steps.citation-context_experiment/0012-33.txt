Okay, let me try to figure this out. First, I need to look at the context around the @@CITATION@@ in the passage. The sentence says, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." 

So, the authors are comparing their results to those from another study. They mention that their results are substantially different. According to the definitions, CoCoRes is when the citation is used to compare or contrast the results or findings of the cited work with the citing paper. That fits here because they're directly contrasting their results with those cited.

Next, I need to check if there's any other possible class. The example given for CoCoRes is exactly similar to this case. The other options might not fit. For instance, CoCoXY involves comparing two cited studies, but here it's the citing paper vs. the cited one. Basis would be if the citation is foundational, which isn't the case here. Support would mean the citation supports their findings, but they're showing differences. Neutral is when it's just a fact without comparison, but here there's a direct contrast. So CoCoRes is definitely the top class.

Looking for secondary classes. Maybe Neutral could be third if there's no other. But maybe CoCoGM? The example for CoCoGM involves comparing goals or methods. Here, the comparison is about results, not methods or goals. So CoCoRes is first, then maybe Neutral as the context is straightforwardly stating a difference without additional nuance. Wait, but the example for Neutral is more like a factual statement without comparison. Since the citation here is used to contrast results, CoCoRes is first. Then, maybe Neutral if there's no other class. Alternatively, maybe CoCoXY if comparing two studies, but in this case, it's the current work vs. cited work. So CoCoRes is first. Then maybe Neutral or Support. Since they are contrasting, not supporting, Neutral might be third. But maybe Weakness? If the cited study's results are being contrasted as a weakness, but the example for Weakness is when they criticize the cited work's limitations. Here, they just state their results differ. So Weakness might not apply. So Neutral would be third. 

So the top three would be CoCoRes, then maybe Neutral, but wait, maybe there's another. Let me check the definitions again. The example for CoCoRes is exactly this case. The user's sentence is comparing their results with the cited ones. So CoCoRes is definitely first. Then maybe Neutral if there's no other. But maybe CoCoXY if comparing two cited studies. But here, it's the current work versus a cited one. So CoCoRes is first. Then maybe Neutral if there's no other comparison. So the ranking would be CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral as second, but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe the context is purely a comparison of results, so CoCoRes is the only relevant class, but the user wants three. Hmm, perhaps Neutral is third. Alternatively, maybe Weakness is not applicable here. So the top three would be CoCoRes, then maybe Neutral, then maybe something else. But according to the example given, Neutral is when it's a factual statement without supporting or comparing. Since this is a comparison, CoCoRes is first, then perhaps Neutral if there's no other. Alternatively, maybe the user expects three classes but the context only supports one. Maybe Neutral is not the case here. Wait, the example for CoCoRes is exactly matching the user's sentence. So CoCoRes is first. Then perhaps Neutral as third if there's no other. But maybe there's another class. Let me think again. The user's sentence is comparing results between their work and the cited one, so CoCoRes is first. Then maybe CoCoXY if comparing two cited studies, but here it's the current work versus cited. So CoCoXY is not applicable. Then Neutral might be third. So the final ranking is CoCoRes (1), then maybe Neutral (2), but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe there's another class. Let me check the definitions again. The example for CoCoRes is exactly like the user's sentence. So CoCoRes is definitely first. Then perhaps Neutral is third if there's no other. Maybe Neutral is not applicable here. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the user expects three classes even if the context only supports one. Maybe Neutral is third. So the answer would be CoCoRes (1), Neutral (2), then maybe something else. Wait, perhaps the user's example has CoCoRes as first, and maybe Neutral is third. But the example given for Neutral is when it's just stating a fact without comparison. In the user's case, the citation is used to compare results, so CoCoRes is first. Then maybe Neutral is third. But maybe there's another class. Alternatively, maybe CoCoXY is third if there's an indirect comparison. But no, CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies. So I think CoCoRes is first, then maybe Neutral as second, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the user expects three classes even if the context only supports one. Hmm. Well, based on the example given, CoCoRes is the correct first class. The other two would have to be determined. Since the sentence is a direct comparison of results, CoCoRes is first. Then maybe Neutral if there's no other comparison. So the final answer would be CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral as second, and maybe another class. But I'm not sure. Let me stick with the example. The example given for CoCoRes is exactly matching the user's sentence. So CoCoRes is first. Then maybe Neutral is third if there's no other. So the top three would be CoCoRes (1), then maybe Neutral (2), but I'm not confident. Alternatively, maybe CoCoXY is third if there's an indirect comparison, but that's not the case here. So the answer is CoCoRes, then maybe Neutral as third. Wait, the user's example for CoCoRes has the citation as the one being compared. So the answer is CoCoRes first. Then perhaps Neutral is third. But I'm not sure. Maybe Neutral is not applicable here. Alternatively, maybe the user expects three classes even if the context only supports one. In that case, maybe CoCoRes is first, then maybe Neutral as second and third. Hmm. Well, according to the instructions, I need to provide three classes. So I'll go with CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral as second, and maybe something else. Alternatively, perhaps the user expects CoCoRes first, then maybe Support or Similar. But the sentence is contrasting results, not supporting. So Neutral is third. Alright, I'll proceed with that.
