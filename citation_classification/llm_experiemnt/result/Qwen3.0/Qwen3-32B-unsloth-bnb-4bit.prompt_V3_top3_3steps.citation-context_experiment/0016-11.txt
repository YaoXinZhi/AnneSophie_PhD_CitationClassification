Okay, let's tackle this classification task step by step. First, I need to understand the context around the citation in the given passage. The citation is placed in the sentence: "In contrast to the results of @@CITATION@@, our study showed that the application of a specific fungicide significantly reduced the incidence of the disease." 

So, the key part here is the comparison between the current study's results and those of the cited work. The phrase "In contrast to" immediately signals that there's a comparison of results happening here. The authors are pointing out that their findings differ from the previous study mentioned.

Next, I need to determine the general intent. Since they're contrasting results, this falls under the Comparative category. Looking at the specific rhetorical classes under Comparative, CoCoRes is the one that deals with comparing results directly. That's the primary class here. 

Now, are there any secondary classes? The example given for CoCoRes involves a direct contrast of results, which matches this case. The citation isn't being used to support the current work's findings (so Support isn't applicable), nor is it for motivation or future work. The Neutral class isn't right because the citation is being used in a specific argumentative context. 

The only other possible classes might be Basis if the cited work was foundational, but here it's about contrasting results, so CoCoRes is the main one. There's no mention of comparing methods or goals, so CoCoGM isn't relevant. Similarly, CoCoXY involves comparing explanations between two cited studies, which isn't the case here. 

So the top three would be CoCoRes as the primary, then maybe Neutral if there's any descriptive element, but in this case, the contrast is active, so Neutral is less likely. However, if I have to rank three, perhaps CoCoRes is first, then maybe Support if there's any, but I don't see that. Alternatively, maybe Weakness if the cited work's results are being criticized, but the example here is a contrast without necessarily stating the cited work's results as flawed. 

Wait, the example given for Weakness includes pointing out limitations, but in this case, it's a contrast of results without criticism. So Weakness isn't appropriate. Therefore, the top three are CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral if there's any remaining context, but the sentence is purely comparative. Maybe the second could be Basis if the cited work is foundational, but the contrast implies it's more about results. 

Hmm. The primary is definitely CoCoRes. The second might be CoCoXY if comparing explanations, but the example for CoCoXY is about conflicting results between two cited studies. Here, it's comparing the cited study with the current paper. So CoCoRes is the main one. The next could be Support if the cited work's results are being used to support the current contrast, but that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe Motivation isn't right here. 

Given the strict definitions, the top three are CoCoRes, then perhaps Neutral if there's any descriptive aspect, but the sentence is argumentative. Wait, the example for Neutral is when the citation is used neutrally without supporting or comparing. Here, the citation is used to contrast results, so Neutral isn't appropriate. 

So perhaps the top three are CoCoRes first, then maybe Basis if the cited work is foundational, but the example for Basis is about introducing a method. Here, the cited work's results are being contrasted, not foundational. 

Wait, maybe the second class could be CoCoGM if there's a mention of goals or methods, but the sentence doesn't compare methods or goals, just results. So CoCoGM isn't applicable. 

Therefore, the top three are CoCoRes as first, then perhaps Weakness if the cited results are being shown as flawed, but the example here is contrasting without necessarily criticizing. The example for Weakness includes pointing out problematic aspects. Here, the authors are just stating their results differ. 

Given all that, the primary is CoCoRes. The second could be Neutral if the citation is used descriptively, but the sentence is argumentative. Alternatively, maybe there's no second class, but the task requires three. Since the example given in the instructions for CoCoRes is a direct comparison, this is the primary. The next could be Basis if the cited work is foundational, but that's not the case here. 

Wait, perhaps the third class is Neutral. Even though the citation is used in a comparative way, maybe Neutral is a fallback. But Neutral is for when the citation is used neutrally without argumentative intent. The example given for Neutral is descriptive. Here, the citation is used to contrast results, so Neutral isn't right. 

Hmm, perhaps the top three are CoCoRes first, then maybe Support if the cited work's results are being used to support the contrast, but that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe Weakness is the second if the cited results are being shown as less valid, but again, the sentence doesn't state that. 

Given the strict definitions, the correct top three are CoCoRes as first, then maybe Basis and then Neutral, but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe Basis is when the cited work is the foundation. The example for Basis is introducing a method. Here, the cited work's results are being contrasted, so Basis isn't applicable. 

Therefore, the top three are CoCoRes, then maybe CoCoXY if comparing explanations between studies, but the example for CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies. Here, it's comparing cited study with the current paper. So CoCoXY isn't applicable. 

So the only applicable is CoCoRes. Since the task requires three, perhaps the next two are Neutral and then maybe Future or something else, but I don't see how. Maybe Neutral is the second and third. 

Wait, maybe the second is Support if the cited work supports the contrast. But the example for Support is confirming findings. Here, it's contrasting, so Support isn't right. 

Given all this, the top three classes are CoCoRes first, then perhaps Neutral as the second and third. But Neutral is not appropriate here. Alternatively, maybe the task requires three even if there's only one clear class. But the example given in the problem has three, so perhaps the user expects three. 

Given the strict definitions, the correct answer is:

1. CoCoRes  
2. Neutral  
3. Basis  

But I'm not sure. Wait, let me re-examine the example given for CoCoRes. The example says "substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with...", which matches the current case. So CoCoRes is definitely first. 

The second could be CoCoGM if there's a mention of goals or methods, but there isn't. Maybe Neutral if the citation is used descriptively, but the sentence is argumentative. 

Alternatively, perhaps the second is Basis if the cited work is foundational. But the example for Basis is introducing a method. Here, it's contrasting results, so Basis isn't right. 

Given the strict definitions, the only applicable is CoCoRes. But the task requires three, so perhaps Neutral and Basis are forced as second and third. But that might not be accurate. 

Alternatively, maybe the second is Support if the cited work's results are used to support the current contrast. But Support is for confirming findings. 

Hmm. Given the confusion, I'll proceed with CoCoRes as first, then maybe Neutral as second, and Basis as third, even though Basis might not fit. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is CoCoRes first, then CoCoXY second if comparing explanations, but that's not the case. 

After re-reading the definitions, CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies with each other, not with the current paper. So CoCoXY isn't applicable here. 

Therefore, the correct answer is:

1. CoCoRes  
2. Neutral  
3. Basis  

But I'm not entirely sure about Neutral and Basis. Alternatively, maybe the second and third are Motivation and Future, but that doesn't fit. 

Given the example provided in the problem, the correct answer is CoCoRes first, then Neutral and Basis. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is CoCoRes first, then maybe Weakness if the cited work's results are being criticized, but again, the example doesn't show that. 

In conclusion, based on the given definitions, the top three classes are CoCoRes, then Neutral, then Basis.
