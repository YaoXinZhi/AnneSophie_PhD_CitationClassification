Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the results of the present work differ from those of experiments using deuterium saturated metal targets cited. The example given is from CoCoRes, which is about comparing results. So that's a strong indicator.

Next, the general intent here is comparative, specifically contrasting results. The example provided for CoCoRes matches this scenario. Then, looking at other possible classes, maybe CoCoXY if they were comparing explanations between two cited studies, but here it's the current work vs. the cited one. So CoCoRes is primary.

The next could be CoCoXY if there's a mention of conflicting results between two cited studies, but in this case, it's the current study's results vs. the cited. Wait, the example in CoCoXY mentions conflicting results between two cited studies, but here it's the current work's results vs. the cited. Hmm. So maybe CoCoRes is the top. Then, if there's any mention of similar findings, but the example here is about differing results. 

Wait, the example given for CoCoRes is about the present work's results differing from cited experiments. So CoCoRes is definitely the first. Then, maybe Neutral if there's no other intent, but in this case, it's a direct comparison of results. The third might be Neutral if there's no other class fitting. But the example doesn't indicate any other classes. So the top three would be CoCoRes, then maybe CoCoXY if there's a mention of conflicting results between cited studies, but here it's between current and cited. So perhaps CoCoRes is first, then maybe Basis if the cited work is foundational, but the example here is contrasting results. So Basis is unlikely. Then maybe Neutral as a fallback. Wait, the example given for Neutral is a descriptive citation without supporting or comparing. But here, it's a direct comparison of results. So Neutral isn't fitting. Therefore, CoCoRes is first. Then, perhaps CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two cited works, but in this case, it's current vs. cited. So maybe CoCoRes is the only fitting class here. But the user wants three. Hmm. Wait, maybe the example given is CoCoRes, so that's first. Then maybe CoCoGM if there's a comparison of goals or methods, but the example doesn't mention that. The passage says the results differ, so CoCoRes is first. The third might be Neutral, but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe there's another class. Let me check the definitions again. CoCoRes is direct comparison of results between current and cited. CoCoXY is comparison between two cited works. Here, the current work's results are compared with cited, so CoCoRes is first. Then maybe Neutral if there's no other intent, but Neutral is when the citation is used descriptively without supporting, comparing, etc. But here, it's a direct comparison. So perhaps CoCoRes is first, then maybe Weakness if the cited work's results are being criticized, but the example doesn't indicate that. The passage states the results differ, not that the cited work is flawed. So Weakness is not applicable. Therefore, CoCoRes is first. Then maybe CoCoXY if there's a mention of conflicting cited studies, but here it's current vs. cited. So perhaps CoCoRes is the only fitting class, but the user wants three. Maybe Neutral as a third. Wait, the example given for Neutral is when the citation is used in a descriptive way. But here, it's a comparison. So Neutral isn't fitting. Maybe the third is CoCoGM or something else. Wait, perhaps the citation is also used to support a claim, but the example says the results differ, so Support isn't it. Hmm. This is tricky. Maybe the top three are CoCoRes, then maybe Neutral, then maybe CoCoXY. But I'm not sure. Wait, the example given for CoCoRes is exactly matching the scenario here. So CoCoRes is first. The other two might be CoCoXY and Neutral, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the third is Basis if the cited work is foundational, but that's not the case here. I think CoCoRes is the primary class here, and perhaps the other two are Neutral and CoCoXY. But I'm not confident. Let me stick with CoCoRes as first, then maybe CoCoXY if there's a mention of conflicting cited works, but here it's current vs. cited. So maybe CoCoRes is the only applicable class, but the user requires three. Hmm. Maybe Neutral is the third. Alright, I'll go with CoCoRes first, then Neutral, then maybe CoCoGM as a stretch.
