Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. First, I need to look at the context around the citation marked @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. The passage says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." 

So the key part here is that the authors are comparing their results with those from previous experiments that used different metal targets. The phrase "substantially differ" indicates a direct comparison of results. According to the definitions provided, CoCoRes is used when the citation is comparing results or findings between the cited work and the current paper. That seems to fit perfectly here.

Next, I should check if there's any other possible class that might apply. The example given for CoCoRes is very similar to this case, where results are directly contrasted. There's no mention of comparing methods or goals, so CoCoGM isn't relevant. Also, the citation isn't supporting the current work's findings, so Support isn't the right fit. The context is about differing results, not about motivating the research or pointing out weaknesses. 

Looking at Neutral, the example there is more about stating facts without direct comparison. Here, the comparison is explicit, so Neutral is less appropriate. The top class is definitely CoCoRes. 

Now, for the second and third classes. Could there be another layer? Maybe a general comparison? But the example for CoCoXY involves comparing two cited studies with each other, not with the current paper. Since the current citation is comparing their results with the cited work, not between two cited works, CoCoXY isn't applicable here. 

Is there a Basis? Basis refers to foundational work, but this citation is about contrasting results, not establishing a foundation. Motivation and Future don't fit either. Weakness would involve criticism, which isn't present here. 

So the top three would be CoCoRes first. For the next two, maybe Neutral and CoCoXY? Wait, Neutral is when the citation is just descriptive. But in this case, the comparison is direct, so Neutral is less likely. Maybe there's no second or third class that fits perfectly. However, according to the instructions, we need to list three. Since CoCoRes is the primary, perhaps the next could be CoCoXY if there's an indirect comparison between studies, but the example for CoCoXY involves comparing two cited studies. Here, it's comparing cited work with current, so CoCoRes is the only strong one. The other two might be Neutral or maybe Support. But Support would require the citation supporting the current work's findings, which isn't the case here. 

Wait, maybe the citation is used to highlight a difference, which could imply a Basis if the cited work is foundational, but the example for Basis is about introducing a method. Here, it's about results differing, so Basis isn't right. 

So perhaps after CoCoRes, the next could be Neutral if there's no other clear class. But Neutral is when the citation is used neutrally. Since the citation is used to compare results, Neutral isn't the best fit. Maybe the third is Neutral as a fallback. Alternatively, maybe CoCoGM if there's a mention of methods, but the context here is about results. 

Hmm. The passage specifically mentions the results differing from experiments with different metal targets. So the primary class is CoCoRes. There's no other clear class here. Maybe Neutral is the second, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe there's no second or third, but the task requires three. Given the example for Neutral is stating a fact without argument, perhaps Neutral is the third. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe there's no second or third. Since the instructions require three, perhaps CoCoRes is first, then maybe Neutral and then CoCoXY. But I'm not confident. Let me stick with CoCoRes as first, then Neutral as second, and maybe CoCoGM as third if there's any mention of methods, but the context doesn't mention methods. So perhaps Neutral and then maybe Basis. Wait, Basis is foundational. This citation isn't about establishing a foundation but contrasting results. 

I think the safest answer is CoCoRes as first, then Neutral, then maybe CoCoXY. But the example for CoCoXY involves comparing two cited studies, not cited and current. So perhaps Neutral is second. Therefore, the top three are CoCoRes, then Neutral, then maybe CoCoGM. But CoCoGM is about goals or methods. Since the passage mentions experiments with different targets, maybe methods are involved. However, the comparison is about results, not methods. So CoCoGM isn't appropriate. 

Hmm. Maybe the correct top three are CoCoRes, then Neutral, then maybe Basis. But Basis is about foundational work, which isn't the case here. I'm a bit stuck, but given the instructions, I'll proceed with CoCoRes as first, then Neutral as second, and then maybe CoCoXY as third. But I'm not sure. Wait, the example for CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies, which isn't the case here. So perhaps Neutral is third. But Neutral is when the citation is neutral. Since the citation is being used to contrast results, Neutral isn't the best fit. Maybe there's no second or third. But the task requires three. Given that, perhaps the answer is CoCoRes, then Neutral, then maybe CoCoGM. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, maybe the answer is CoCoRes, then Neutral, then CoCoXY. I'll go with CoCoRes first, Neutral second, CoCoXY third as per the instructions, even if it's not perfect.
