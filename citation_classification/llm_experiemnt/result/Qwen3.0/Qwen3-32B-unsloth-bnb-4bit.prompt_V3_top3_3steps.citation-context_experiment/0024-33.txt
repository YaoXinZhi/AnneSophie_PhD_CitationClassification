Okay, let's tackle this classification task step by step. First, I need to look at the citation marked @@CITATION@@ in the provided passage. The passage says, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." 

So, the context here is comparing the current study's results with those from another study that used different metal targets. The key phrase here is "substantially differ," which indicates a direct comparison of results between the two studies. 

Next, I need to determine the general intent. Since the citation is used to contrast findings, this falls under the Comparative category. Looking at the specific rhetorical classes under Comparative, CoCoRes is for comparing results. 

Now, checking if there are other possible classes. The example given for CoCoRes matches this scenario exactly. There's no mention of comparing goals or methods (CoCoGM) or contrasting explanations between two cited studies (CoCoXY). The citation isn't supporting the current work's findings or pointing out similarities, so Support or Similar aren't applicable. There's no indication of criticism or weakness in the cited work either. 

Therefore, the primary class here is CoCoRes. The next possible classes might be Neutral if there's no strong intent beyond comparison, but since the comparison is explicit, Neutral is less likely. The third could be Basis if the cited work is foundational, but the context is about differing results rather than foundational work. Hence, the top three are CoCoRes, then possibly Neutral and Basis as lower ranks.
