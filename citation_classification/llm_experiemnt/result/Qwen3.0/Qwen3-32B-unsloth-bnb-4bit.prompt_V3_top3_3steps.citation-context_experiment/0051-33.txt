Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the citation marked @@CITATION@@. The passage says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." 

So the main point here is comparing the current study's results with those from the cited work. The phrase "substantially differ" indicates a direct comparison of results. Looking at the definitions, CoCoRes is when the citation compares results or findings. That seems like the primary class here.

Next, the general intent. The authors are contrasting their results with previous experiments. This is clearly a comparative intent focusing on results, which aligns with CoCoRes. There's no mention of methods or goals here, so CoCoGM isn't applicable. They're not comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies, so CoCoXY is out. 

For the secondary classes, maybe there's a neutral mention since they're just stating a difference without supporting or criticizing. Neutral would be if it's a straightforward comparison without taking sides. But the example for CoCoRes includes direct comparison, so Neutral might come in second. However, the example given for Neutral is more descriptive without any comparison. Wait, the example for CoCoRes uses "substantially differ," which is exactly what's happening here. So CoCoRes is definitely first. 

Is there a possibility of another class? The citation isn't supporting their own work, nor is it a basis. It's not motivating future work or pointing out weaknesses. The primary is CoCoRes. The next could be Neutral if they're just stating a fact without further analysis. But maybe CoCoXY if they're comparing two studies, but the example for CoCoXY involves comparing two cited studies, not the current one. Since the example here is comparing the current work with the cited, it's CoCoRes. Neutral would be if they're just mentioning it without comparing, but here they are contrasting. So Neutral might not fit. Wait, maybe Basis isn't applicable here. 

Wait, the example for Basis is about foundational work. This isn't foundational; it's comparative. So after CoCoRes, maybe Neutral or another. But the example for Neutral is more about stating facts without any comparison. Since the citation is used to contrast results, CoCoRes is first. Then perhaps Neutral if the rest is just stating the existence of the cited work. Alternatively, maybe CoCoXY if comparing explanations, but the example for CoCoXY is between two cited studies. Since this is comparing cited with current, CoCoRes is the right. 

So the top three would be CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral or Support. Wait, Support is when the citation supports the current work. Here, they're contrasting, so Support isn't right. Neutral is when it's descriptive. Since they are contrasting, maybe Neutral isn't the best second. But perhaps there's no other applicable classes. The example given for CoCoRes is similar, so CoCoRes is first. Then maybe Neutral as the second, but maybe there's no other class. Alternatively, maybe Future or Motivation. But the citation isn't suggesting future work or motivating the current study. 

Hmm. Maybe the top three are CoCoRes, then Neutral, then CoCoGM. But CoCoGM is about goals or methods. Since the context mentions experiments with deuterium targets, maybe CoCoGM could be a secondary class if they're comparing methods. Wait, the cited work's experiments used deuterium targets, and the current work's results differ. If the methods are different (using different targets), maybe CoCoGM is also applicable. But the example for CoCoGM is comparing goals or methods. The sentence here mentions the results differ from experiments with deuterium targets. It doesn't explicitly compare methods, just results. So CoCoGM might not be applicable. 

Therefore, the top three are CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral if there's no other class. But Neutral is when it's descriptive without comparison. Wait, the citation is used to compare results, so Neutral isn't correct. Maybe there's no second class besides CoCoRes. But the task requires three. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me recheck the definitions. 

The example for CoCoRes is a direct comparison of results. The given example matches that. So CoCoRes is first. Then, maybe Neutral is the second if the rest is just stating the existence of the cited work. The sentence structure is stating that their results differ from the cited experiments. Neutral would be if it's just mentioning the cited work's existence. But since they are contrasting results, Neutral isn't the best fit. 

Wait, maybe there's another class. Let's think again. The citation is used to compare results (CoCoRes), but maybe also to support the current work's novelty. Wait, Support is when the citation supports the current work's findings. Here, they are contrasting, so Support isn't applicable. 

Alternatively, maybe the citation is used to highlight a difference, which could imply a Weakness if the cited work's results are considered flawed. But the sentence doesn't criticize the cited work; it just states a difference. So Weakness isn't right. 

Given that, the top three classes would be CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral as the second, and perhaps CoCoXY as third. But CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies. Since the example here is comparing cited with current work, CoCoXY isn't applicable. 

So the correct top three are CoCoRes first, then Neutral second, and maybe another. Wait, Neutral is when the citation is descriptive without supporting or comparing. Since this is a comparison, Neutral isn't right. Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Based on the example given in the instructions, the correct answer is CoCoRes first. The other two might not fit, but since the task requires three, perhaps Neutral is the second. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe CoCoXY isn't applicable. 

Wait, the example for CoCoRes is the same structure as the given passage. So the primary is CoCoRes. The next could be Neutral if the rest is just stating the existence. But Neutral isn't correct here. Maybe the task expects only CoCoRes as the first, and the other two classes are Neutral and something else. But I'm stuck. Given the example, I'll go with CoCoRes first. Maybe the other two are Neutral and Basis, but Basis isn't applicable. 

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is CoCoRes first, then Neutral second, and then CoCoGM third. But I'm not confident. Given the strict instructions, I'll proceed with CoCoRes as the primary.
