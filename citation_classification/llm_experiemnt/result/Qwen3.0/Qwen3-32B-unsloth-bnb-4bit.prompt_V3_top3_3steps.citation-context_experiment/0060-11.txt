Okay, let's tackle this classification problem step by step. First, I need to understand the context around the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. The user hasn't provided the actual passage, but based on the examples and definitions given, I can infer the possible intent.

Looking at the example for CoCoXY, it's about comparing two cited studies with each other, not with the current paper. The example mentions conflicting results between two studies. If the citation in question is used to contrast findings between two other works, then CoCoXY would be appropriate. 

Next, CoCoRes is for comparing results of the cited work with the current paper. If the passage states that the current results differ from those in the cited work, that's CoCoRes. 

Neutral is when the citation is used descriptively without any direct comparison or support. 

Since the example given for CoCoXY involves comparing two cited studies, if the context here is pointing out conflicting results between two studies cited, then CoCoXY would be the top class. If there's also a mention of differing results from the current work, that would be CoCoRes. However, if the main point is contrasting two cited works, CoCoXY takes precedence. Neutral might be third if there's no strong argumentative intent beyond description.

Assuming the citation is in a context that's comparing two studies' explanations or claims, the top three would be CoCoXY, then maybe CoCoRes if there's a direct comparison with the current study, but if not, perhaps Support or Similar. However, based on the examples, CoCoXY is specific to comparing cited studies, so if that's the case, it's first. If there's also a mention of similar findings, then Similar could be second, but given the example, CoCoXY is more precise. Neutral would be third if there's no further argumentative intent.
