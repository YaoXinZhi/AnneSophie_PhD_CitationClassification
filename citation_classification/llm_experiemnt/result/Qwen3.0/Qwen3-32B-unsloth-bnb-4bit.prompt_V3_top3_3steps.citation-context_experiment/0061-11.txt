Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the citation marked @@CITATION@@. The passage says, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." So the citation is being used to compare results here.

Next, determining the general intent. The phrase "substantially differ from the results" indicates a comparison of findings between the current study and the cited work. According to the definitions, this falls under Comparative, specifically CoCoRes since it's comparing results.

Now, ranking the top three rhetorical classes. The primary class here is clearly CoCoRes because the citation is directly contrasting results. Then, looking at the example given for CoCoRes, it's a direct match. The next possible classes might be Basis if the cited work is foundational, but the context here is about differing results, not establishing a foundation. Maybe Neutral if there's no strong argument, but the comparison is explicit. However, the example for Neutral is more about stating facts without argument. Since the comparison is direct, CoCoRes is first. The second could be CoCoXY if comparing explanations, but the example for CoCoXY involves comparing two cited studies, not the current paper. So maybe Neutral as the third, since the citation is just stating a difference without further analysis. Wait, the example for Neutral is a descriptive use without supporting or comparing. Here, it's a comparison, so Neutral might not fit. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe Motivation if the differing results are a reason to conduct the current study. But the example for Motivation is about justifying the research due to a knowledge gap. In this case, the citation is contrasting results, so Motivation isn't the best fit. So after CoCoRes, perhaps CoCoGM if there's a method comparison, but the example for CoCoGM is about goals or methods. The passage mentions "experiments conducted with deuterium saturated metal targets," which refers to methods. Wait, the cited work's methods are different, leading to different results. So maybe CoCoGM (Comparison of Goals or Methods) is also relevant here. The example for CoCoGM compares methods. So the citation is comparing methods (deuterium targets) leading to different results. So maybe CoCoRes is first, CoCoGM second. Then Neutral as third if there's no other intent. Alternatively, maybe Neutral isn't the right third. Let me check the example again. The Neutral example is stating a fact without argument. Here, the citation is contrasting results, so Neutral might not be appropriate. Maybe Weakness if the cited work's results are being criticized. But the example for Weakness is pointing out limitations. The passage here says the results differ, not that the cited work is flawed. So Weakness isn't right. Therefore, the top three would be CoCoRes (1), CoCoGM (2), and Neutral (3). Wait, but Neutral might not fit. Alternatively, maybe Future? No, the example for Future is suggesting directions. Hmm. The best options are CoCoRes, CoCoGM, and maybe Support or Similar. But Support is about confirming findings. Since the results differ, Support isn't right. Similar is about pointing out similarities, which isn't the case here. So Neutral might be the third if there's no other intent. Alternatively, maybe there's no third class. But according to the instructions, three must be listed. Given the context, CoCoRes is first, CoCoGM second (since methods are compared), and Neutral third as the least relevant.
