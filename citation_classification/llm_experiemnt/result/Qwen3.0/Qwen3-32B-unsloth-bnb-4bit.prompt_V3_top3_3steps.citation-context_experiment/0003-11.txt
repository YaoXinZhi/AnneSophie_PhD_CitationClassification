Okay, let's tackle this classification problem step by step. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions the citation in the sentence: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." 

The key part here is that the authors are comparing their results to those from previous experiments. The phrase "substantially differ" indicates a direct comparison of findings. According to the definitions, CoCoRes is used when comparing results or findings between the citing paper and the cited work. That seems like the primary class here.

Next, looking at the general intent, the citation is being used to highlight differences in results. There's no mention of goals or methods comparison (which would be CoCoGM), nor is there a discussion of other studies compared to each other without the citing paper (CoCoXY). The intent is to contrast their results with existing ones, so CoCoRes is the main class.

For the secondary classes, maybe there's a slight element of Neutral if the citation is just stating facts without strong support or criticism, but the example given for CoCoRes doesn't mention Neutral as part of it. Alternatively, perhaps there's a Basis if the cited work is foundational, but the example provided for Basis involves introducing a method, which isn't the case here. 

Looking at the example for CoCoXY, it involves comparing two cited studies. Here, it's the citing study's results versus the cited ones, so CoCoRes is more accurate. 

So the top three would be CoCoRes first. Then, maybe Neutral if the citation is just descriptive, but the example for Neutral is more about stating facts without comparison. However, since the citation is directly comparing results, Neutral might not be the best second. Alternatively, maybe Support if they are using the cited work to support their own findings, but since they're stating differences, Support is less likely. 

Wait, the example for CoCoRes includes a direct comparison of results. The given sentence does that. So CoCoRes is definitely first. Then, perhaps Neutral if there's no further intent beyond stating the comparison. Alternatively, maybe Motivation if the cited work's results are motivating the current study, but the example for Motivation involves justifying the research, which isn't present here. 

So the secondary classes might be Neutral and then maybe Basis. But the cited work isn't serving as a foundation here. So Neutral could be second, and maybe CoCoXY third if there's a comparison between cited studies, but in this case, it's between the citing and cited. Therefore, Neutral might be second and Basis third if the cited work is foundational. However, the example for Basis involves introducing a method, which isn't the case here. 

Hmm. Maybe the correct order is CoCoRes first, Neutral second, and then CoCoXY third. But CoCoXY is for comparing cited studies with each other, not the citing paper. Since the citation is comparing the current work's results with the cited ones, CoCoXY isn't applicable. 

Therefore, the top three classes would be CoCoRes, then Neutral (if the citation is just stating the comparison neutrally), and maybe Support if the cited work is being used to support the current findings, but since they're contrasting, Support isn't right. 

Wait, the example for Support includes the cited work confirming the authors' findings. Here, the authors are stating differences, so Support isn't applicable. So Neutral might be the second class if the citation is just descriptive. However, Neutral examples don't involve comparison. 

This is a bit tricky. Let me re-examine the definitions. CoCoRes is the primary here. The other options might be Neutral if the citation is just stating the existence of prior results without supporting or contrasting. But in the example given for CoCoRes, they do state differences. So Neutral might not be appropriate here. 

Wait, maybe there's another angle. If the citation is used to compare results, CoCoRes is the main class. The secondary could be Basis if the cited work is foundational to the current study's comparison. But the example for Basis involves introducing a method, which isn't the case here. 

Alternatively, maybe Weakness if the cited work's results are being criticized, but the example for Weakness involves pointing out flaws, which isn't happening here. 

So perhaps the top three are CoCoRes, then Neutral (since the citation is just stating prior results without strong support or criticism), and then maybe CoCoGM if there's any mention of goals or methods, but the sentence doesn't compare goals or methods. 

Therefore, the final answer is CoCoRes first, then Neutral second, and maybe Basis third if Neutral isn't applicable. Wait, the example for Basis is introducing a method, which isn't the case here. So perhaps Neutral isn't the right second class. 

Wait, the example for Neutral is stating a fact about the use of magnetic devices. In the given sentence, the citation is stating prior results, which is similar to Neutral's example. So Neutral could be the second class. 

But the primary intent is CoCoRes, so Neutral might be the second. Third could be Basis if the cited work is foundational, but again, not in this case. Alternatively, maybe Support isn't applicable. 

So the final ranking would be CoCoRes, Neutral, and maybe CoCoXY third if there's a comparison between cited studies, but there isn't. Therefore, Neutral third might not be right. 

Hmm. I think the correct answer is CoCoRes first, Neutral second, and then Basis third. Wait, but Basis isn't applicable here. Maybe Weakness? No, because there's no criticism. 

I'm a bit confused. Let me look again. The example given for CoCoRes is exactly like the sentence in the passage. So CoCoRes is definitely first. The second could be Neutral if the citation is just descriptive, but since it's comparing results, maybe Neutral isn't the right second class. Maybe there's another class. 

Wait, maybe the answer is CoCoRes first, then Neutral second, and then Basis third. But Basis isn't applicable here. 

Alternatively, perhaps Neutral isn't the right second class. Maybe the answer is CoCoRes first, then Neutral second, then CoCoXY third. But CoCoXY isn't applicable here. 

Given the example provided in the problem statement for CoCoRes matches the sentence exactly, CoCoRes is first. The other classes might not fit, but according to the instructions, we need three. So maybe Neutral is second and then CoCoXY third. 

But CoCoXY is for comparing cited studies with each other, not with the citing paper. Since the sentence compares the citing paper's results with the cited work, CoCoXY isn't applicable. 

Therefore, the top three are CoCoRes, Neutral, and maybe Basis. But Basis isn't applicable. 

I think I need to go with CoCoRes first, then Neutral second, and then maybe CoCoGM third. But the sentence doesn't mention goals or methods. 

Given the strict definitions, the correct answer is CoCoRes first, then Neutral second, and then CoCoXY third. But CoCoXY isn't applicable. 

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let's refer back to the example given for CoCoRes. The example is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." The example given in the problem statement's CoCoRes is exactly like this. Therefore, the correct class is CoCoRes first. 

The second class might be Neutral if the citation is just stating prior results. Neutral's example is "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@." Here, the citation is stating prior results, so Neutral could be second. 

Third class could be Basis if the cited work is foundational. But the example for Basis is introducing a method. Since the cited work here is providing prior results for comparison, not the foundation, Basis isn't applicable. 

So the final three classes would be CoCoRes, Neutral, and maybe Weakness. But there's no criticism here. 

Therefore, the top three are CoCoRes, Neutral, and then maybe CoCoXY. But CoCoXY isn't applicable. 

Given the problem's example, the correct answer is CoCoRes first, then Neutral second, and then CoCoXY third. Even though CoCoXY might not fit perfectly, perhaps Neutral is the best second option. 

Wait, Neutral's example is descriptive without comparison. Since the citation is comparing results, Neutral might not be appropriate. 

This is confusing. Let me try to look up the definitions again. 

CoCoRes: direct comparison of results between citing and cited. 

Neutral: neutral, descriptive without supporting, comparing, criticizing, or motivating. 

The citation here is comparing results, so it's CoCoRes. The other classes don't fit. Therefore, the top three are CoCoRes, then maybe Neutral isn't applicable. But the problem requires three classes. 

Wait, maybe the answer is CoCoRes first, then Neutral second, and then CoCoXY third. Even though CoCoXY isn't applicable, perhaps Neutral is the second. 

Given the example provided, I think the answer is CoCoRes first, then Neutral second, and then CoCoXY third. But I'm not entirely sure. However, based on the strict definitions and examples given, CoCoRes is the primary class, Neutral second if the citation is descriptive, and CoCoXY third if there's a comparison between cited studies, which there isn't. 

Therefore, the final answer is CoCoRes, then Neutral, then CoCoXY.
