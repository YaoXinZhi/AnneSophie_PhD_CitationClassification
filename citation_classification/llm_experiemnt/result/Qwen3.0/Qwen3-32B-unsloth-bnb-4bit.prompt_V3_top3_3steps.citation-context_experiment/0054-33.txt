Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the user wants me to classify the citation marked @@CITATION@@ in the given passage into the top three rhetorical classes. First, I need to understand the context around the citation.

Looking at the passage, the sentence is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." 

Hmm, the key part here is "substantially differ from the results of the experiments." That sounds like they're comparing their results with those from the cited work. From the example given under CoCoRes, it's about comparing results directly. So CoCoRes is probably the main one here.

Now, are there any other comparisons? The example for CoCoXY involves comparing two cited studies with each other, not with the current paper. In this case, the comparison is between the current work and the cited one, not between two cited works. So CoCoXY might not apply here. 

What about Basis? The Basis class is for foundational references. But this citation is contrasting results, not establishing a foundation. Motivation or Future don't fit because there's no mention of why the research is done or future directions. Support or Similar also don't fit since it's a difference, not support or similarity. 

So the primary class is CoCoRes. Then, maybe Neutral? Wait, Neutral is when it's just descriptive without supporting or comparing. But here, it's a direct comparison. However, maybe there's another layer. If the citation is only used to point out a difference in results, then CoCoRes is first. The example given for CoCoRes matches this scenario. 

Is there a secondary class? The example under CoCoXY mentions conflicting results between two studies. In this case, the current study's results differ from the cited one. But CoCoXY is when comparing two cited works. Since the comparison here is between the current work and the cited, it's CoCoRes. 

So the top three would be CoCoRes as the main one. Then maybe Neutral if there's any neutral description. Wait, the sentence is stating a difference, which is a comparison of results. Neutral would be if it's just stating facts without argument. But here, the comparison is explicit. So maybe CoCoRes is first, then perhaps Basis if the cited work is foundational. But no, the cited work here is being contrasted. 

Wait, maybe CoCoRes is the primary, and then perhaps Weakness? But Weakness is when the citation is criticized. Here, it's just stating a difference. So Weakness doesn't apply. 

I think the top class is CoCoRes. Then maybe Neutral if there's no further classification. Wait, the example for Neutral is something like stating a fact without argument. In this case, the sentence is stating a difference in results, which is a direct comparison, so CoCoRes. 

Therefore, the top three classes would be CoCoRes as 1, then maybe Neutral as 2 if there's any neutral aspect, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe there's another class. Wait, perhaps CoCoGM? No, CoCoGM is comparing goals or methods, not results. 

So the answer is CoCoRes first. Then maybe Neutral if there's no other. But Neutral is for when it's just descriptive. Since the sentence is comparing results, maybe CoCoRes is the only relevant class. But the user wants three. Hmm. Maybe Neutral is the third. Let me check the example again. Neutral example is something like stating a fact without supporting or comparing. Here, the sentence is comparing results, so Neutral might not fit. Maybe CoCoRes is the only one, but the user requires three. Wait, maybe the example under CoCoXY is when comparing two cited works. In this case, it's the current work vs cited. So CoCoRes is the correct one. Then perhaps Neutral is not applicable. But the user requires three classes. Maybe Neutral is third. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the third is Basis. Wait, Basis is foundational. If the cited work is the basis for the current study, but here they're contrasting results. So Basis isn't right. 

Hmm, maybe the top three are CoCoRes, then maybe CoCoXY if there's an indirect comparison. Wait, CoCoXY is when comparing two cited works. Since this is comparing the current work with the cited, CoCoRes is correct. So maybe the top three are CoCoRes, Neutral, and then something else. But Neutral might not fit. Maybe the third is just Neutral. Alternatively, maybe there's no third. But the user requires three. Maybe Neutral is third. Let me check the example again. Neutral is when the citation is used descriptively without supporting, comparing, etc. In this case, the citation is used to compare results, so Neutral isn't correct. Therefore, perhaps CoCoRes is the only correct class, but the user wants three. Maybe there's a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps there's another class. Wait, maybe Support? No, Support is when the citation supports the current work. Here, it's contrasting. 

Wait, maybe the answer is CoCoRes first, Neutral second, and then maybe Basis third. But why? Neutral doesn't fit. Maybe the user expects three even if some are not perfect. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is CoCoRes, then maybe CoCoXY if there's an indirect comparison. But the example under CoCoXY is when comparing two cited works. Since this is comparing current work with cited, CoCoRes is correct. So the top three would be CoCoRes, then maybe Neutral, then Basis. But I'm not sure. Maybe the correct answer is CoCoRes as first, Neutral as second, and then CoCoXY as third. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, maybe the answer is CoCoRes first, then CoCoXY if there's any indirect comparison. Hmm. This is tricky. I'll go with CoCoRes as the primary, then Neutral as second, and then maybe CoCoXY as third if forced to pick three. But I think the correct answer is CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral, but I'm not sure. Let me check again. The example for CoCoRes is exactly matching the scenario here. So the answer should be CoCoRes as 1, then maybe Neutral as 2 and CoCoXY as 3. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is CoCoRes, Neutral, and then Basis. But Basis isn't right. Alright, I'll proceed with CoCoRes as first, then maybe Neutral and CoCoXY as the next two, even if I'm not fully certain.
