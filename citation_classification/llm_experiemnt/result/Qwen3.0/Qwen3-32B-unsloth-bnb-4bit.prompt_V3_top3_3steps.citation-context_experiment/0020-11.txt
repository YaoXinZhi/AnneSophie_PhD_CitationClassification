Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation marked in the given passage. First, I should extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." 

So the context is about comparing the current results with those from previous experiments using different metal targets. The key word here is "substantially differ," which indicates a direct comparison of results. According to the definitions, CoCoRes is when the citation compares results or findings. That seems like the primary class here.

Next, the example given for CoCoRes matches this scenario exactly. The citation is used to contrast the current work's results with those cited. Now, looking for secondary classes. The passage doesn't mention any comparison between two cited studies (so CoCoXY isn't likely). There's no motivation or future work mentioned either. Neutral is possible if it's just stating facts, but since there's a direct comparison, Neutral would be lower. 

So the top three would be CoCoRes first, then maybe CoCoGM if there's a method comparison, but the example here is about results, not goals or methods. The passage specifically refers to results, so CoCoRes is first. The other options might be Neutral if there's no further intent. Wait, the example for Neutral is when it's descriptive without argument. Here, the comparison is direct, so Neutral isn't the main one. The third could be Basis if the cited work is foundational, but the context is about differing results, not establishing a foundation. So maybe CoCoRes is first, then perhaps Neutral or CoCoXY. But since the example for CoCoXY involves comparing two cited studies, not the current work and cited, CoCoXY isn't applicable here. So the top three would be CoCoRes, then maybe Neutral if there's no other intent. Wait, the example for Neutral is when the citation is used descriptively without supporting or comparing. But here, it's a direct comparison of results, so CoCoRes is definitely first. The second could be CoCoGM if there's a method comparison, but the context is about results. So maybe CoCoRes is first, then Neutral as a lower priority. Alternatively, if there's no other applicable classes, maybe CoCoRes is first, then Neutral, then Basis. Wait, the Basis is when the citation is foundational. Since the cited work here is being compared in results, it's not foundational. So the top three would be CoCoRes, then Neutral, then maybe Future or something else. Hmm, perhaps Neutral isn't right here. Let me check again. The example for Neutral is when it's descriptive without argument. The passage is stating a difference in results, which is a comparison, so Neutral might not fit. Maybe CoCoRes is first, then CoCoGM if there's a method comparison. Wait, the passage says "experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets," which could be a method difference. So CoCoGM (Comparison of Goals or Methods) could be secondary. But the main comparison is of results. So primary is CoCoRes, secondary CoCoGM, tertiary Neutral. Wait, but CoCoGM is comparing goals or methods. The example given for CoCoGM is comparing methods. Here, the cited work used different metal targets (methods), so comparing methods. Therefore, CoCoGM would also apply. But the main comparison is of results. So the top three would be CoCoRes, CoCoGM, and maybe Neutral. Wait, the example for CoCoRes is a direct comparison of results, which matches the context. The example for CoCoGM is comparing methods. Since the cited work used different methods (deuterium saturated targets), the comparison here includes both results and methods. Therefore, CoCoRes and CoCoGM both apply. But the primary intent is comparing results, so CoCoRes is first, then CoCoGM as secondary. Neutral would be third if there's no other intent. Alternatively, maybe Neutral isn't applicable here. Hmm. I think the correct ranking is CoCoRes first, CoCoGM second, and Neutral third. Wait, but Neutral is when it's descriptive without argument. The passage is making a direct comparison of results, so Neutral isn't the case here. Maybe the third is Basis? No, because it's not foundational. Alternatively, maybe Weakness? No, the cited work isn't being criticized. So perhaps CoCoRes, CoCoGM, and then maybe Neutral is not applicable. Wait, the example for Neutral is when it's just stating a fact without comparison. Here, the comparison is explicit. Maybe the third is CoCoXY? No, because CoCoXY compares two cited studies. So the top three are CoCoRes, CoCoGM, and Neutral? But Neutral might not fit. Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is CoCoRes first, then CoCoGM second, and then Neutral third, even if Neutral isn't perfect. Alternatively, maybe CoCoRes is first, CoCoGM second, and then maybe Future or something else. Wait, the passage doesn't mention future work. I think the correct answer is CoCoRes as first, CoCoGM as second, and Neutral as third. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check the example again. The CoCoRes example is when results are compared directly. The given passage does that. The CoCoGM example is comparing methods. Since the cited work used different methods (deuterium targets), that's a method comparison. So CoCoGM applies. So the top three would be CoCoRes, CoCoGM, Neutral. But Neutral might not be right here. Maybe the third is Basis? No. Alternatively, maybe Weakness? No. Hmm. Maybe Neutral is the third because there's no further intent beyond the comparison. But the example for Neutral is when it's descriptive without argument. Since the passage is making a comparison, Neutral isn't the case. Therefore, the top three are CoCoRes, CoCoGM, and perhaps CoCoXY? No, CoCoXY is between two cited studies. So the correct answer is CoCoRes first, CoCoGM second, and then maybe Future? No. I think the correct answer is CoCoRes, CoCoGM, Neutral. But Neutral might not fit. Maybe the third is just Neutral as a fallback. So I'll go with CoCoRes first, CoCoGM second, Neutral third.
