Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. The passage says, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." 

So the key part here is that the authors are comparing their results with those from a previous study. The phrase "substantially differ from the results" indicates a direct comparison of findings. According to the definitions, CoCoRes is used when comparing results or findings between the citing paper and the cited work. That seems like the primary class here.

Next, looking at the general intent. The authors are highlighting differences in results, which falls under Comparative intent. The specific class for comparing results is CoCoRes. Now, are there other possible classes? The example given for CoCoRes matches this scenario exactly. There's no mention of contrasting methods or goals, so CoCoGM isn't applicable. Also, there's no comparison between two cited studies, so CoCoXY isn't relevant here. 

Is there any support or similarity? The authors aren't supporting their findings with the cited work but rather pointing out differences. So Support or Similar don't fit. There's no indication of criticism or weakness in the cited work either. The intent is purely to show contrast in results, so CoCoRes is the top class. 

For secondary classes, maybe Neutral could be considered if there's no clear intent beyond comparison. However, since the comparison is direct and specific to results, Neutral is less likely. The third class might be Basis if the cited work is foundational, but the context here is about differing results, not establishing a foundation. So the top three would be CoCoRes first, then perhaps Neutral if there's no other intent, but I don't see another clear secondary class here. Wait, maybe Future? No, the example for Future is suggesting directions for research, which isn't the case here. Motivation is about justifying the research, which also doesn't fit. So after CoCoRes, the next possible classes might be Neutral or Basis. Since the cited work's results are being compared, and there's no support or motivation, Neutral might be the second, but the example for Neutral is more descriptive without comparison. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe Weakness if the cited work's results are being shown as different, implying a limitation. But the example for Weakness involves criticizing the cited work, not just differing results. The passage here states a difference without necessarily criticizing. So Weakness might not be right. Therefore, the top three are CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral or Basis. Wait, the Basis example refers to foundational work, which isn't the case here. So the second could be Neutral. Third might be CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two cited studies, but in this case, it's only comparing the current work with one cited study. So CoCoXY isn't applicable. Therefore, the top three are CoCoRes, Neutral, and maybe Support if there's any, but Support isn't here. So final ranking is CoCoRes first, Neutral second, and then maybe CoCoGM or another, but I don't see it. Wait, the example for CoCoRes is exactly matching the given passage. So the top three should be CoCoRes, Neutral, and then maybe Basis if applicable. But since the cited work's results are being compared, not establishing a foundation, Basis isn't right. So Neutral might be second if there's a neutral mention, but the comparison is active. Alternatively, maybe Future isn't applicable. Hmm. Let me check again. The passage is comparing their results to the cited work's results, so CoCoRes is first. There's no other clear intent beyond that. So maybe the next classes are Neutral and then another. But perhaps the example for Neutral is more descriptive without any argument, but here the comparison is part of the argument. So Neutral might not fit. Wait, the example for Neutral is when the citation is used in a neutral way without supporting or comparing. In this case, the citation is used to compare results, so Neutral isn't the best fit. Maybe the second class is Basis if the cited work is foundational, but the example for Basis is about introducing a method, which isn't the case here. Hmm. Maybe the second class is CoCoGM if there's a mention of methods, but the passage talks about results. So perhaps the only applicable class is CoCoRes, and the other two are Neutral and Basis. But I'm not sure. Given the strict definitions, the primary is CoCoRes, and the others might be Neutral or Basis if they fit. Since the cited work's results are being compared, perhaps there's no other class. Maybe the answer is CoCoRes first, then Neutral second, and then Basis third. But I'm not certain. Let me stick with the example given for CoCoRes, which matches the passage exactly. So the top three are CoCoRes, Neutral, and then maybe another. Alternatively, maybe CoCoRes is the only one, but the task requires three. Since the example for CoCoRes is the same as the passage, I'll go with CoCoRes as first. For the second and third, maybe Neutral and Basis if applicable, but perhaps Neutral is the safest bet as the fallback. So final answer: 1. CoCoRes, 2. Neutral, 3. Basis.
