Okay, let's tackle this classification task step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the citation marked @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. The passage mentions that the results of the present work substantially differ from experiments using deuterium saturated metal targets, citing @@CITATION@@. 

Next, I have to determine the general intent of the citation. The key phrase here is "substantially differ," which indicates a direct comparison between the current study's results and those of the cited work. This points towards a Comparative intent.

Looking at the specific rhetorical classes under Comparative, CoCoRes is about comparing results or findings. The example provided matches this scenario where results are directly contrasted. There's also mention of conflicting results in another study, which might relate to CoCoXY, but the primary comparison here is between the current work and the cited study, not between two cited studies. 

The citation isn't supporting the current work's findings (Support), nor is it motivating the research (Motivation). It's not about future directions or weaknesses either. The Neutral class doesn't apply because there's an explicit comparison happening. 

So the top three classes would be CoCoRes as the primary comparison of results, followed by CoCoXY if there's a secondary comparison between cited studies, but wait, in the example given for CoCoXY, it's comparing two cited studies. Here, the comparison is between the current work and the cited work, so CoCoXY might not be the best fit. Wait, the example for CoCoRes is comparing current work with cited work's results. The passage here is doing exactly that. So CoCoRes is definitely first. 

Then, maybe Neutral comes in if there's any other descriptive element, but the main intent is comparative. Wait, maybe CoCoXY isn't applicable here because it's not comparing two cited studies. The example in CoCoXY mentions conflicting results between two studies, but here the comparison is between the current study and one cited study. Therefore, CoCoXY isn't relevant here. 

So the second might be Neutral if there's any neutral mention, but the main comparison is CoCoRes. However, the passage states that the results "substantially differ," which is a direct comparison, so CoCoRes is first. Then maybe Neutral isn't applicable here. Wait, perhaps the second could be something else. Wait, looking back at the options, maybe there's a case for Basis if the citation is foundational, but the example for Basis is about introducing a method, which isn't the case here. 

Alternatively, maybe Support isn't applicable because it's not supporting the current findings. So after CoCoRes, perhaps Neutral is next if there's a descriptive mention. Wait, the passage is using the citation to contrast results, so Neutral might not be appropriate. Hmm. Maybe the next best is CoCoGM if there's a comparison of methods, but the example for CoCoGM involves comparing goals or methods. The passage here is about results, not methods. 

So the top three are CoCoRes as first. Then perhaps Neutral if there's a neutral statement elsewhere, but the main context is the comparison of results. Wait, maybe the second could be CoCoXY if there's a mention of conflicting results between studies. Wait, the example for CoCoXY mentions conflicting results between two cited studies, but here the citation is comparing current work with one study. So CoCoXY isn't applicable here. 

Therefore, the top three would be CoCoRes as first, then maybe Neutral if there's any other neutral information, but the passage is focused on the comparison. Wait, perhaps the second is CoCoXY if the citation is part of a larger comparison between multiple studies. Wait, the passage mentions conflicting results for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima, citing @@CITATION@@. So maybe the comparison here is between two studies (the cited ones), hence CoCoXY. 

So the primary comparison is between the current work and the cited study (CoCoRes), and the secondary comparison is between two cited studies (CoCoXY). Therefore, the top three would be CoCoRes, CoCoXY, and Neutral if there's a neutral mention. Wait, the example for CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies, and here the citation is part of a sentence that mentions conflicting results between two studies. Therefore, CoCoXY is applicable here as well. 

So the top three classes would be CoCoRes (comparison of results between current work and cited work), CoCoXY (comparison between two cited studies), and Neutral if there's a descriptive part. Wait, the example for Neutral is a descriptive citation without supporting or comparing. In the given passage, the citation is part of a comparison, so Neutral might not be applicable here. 

Wait, the passage says "the results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with... @@CITATION@@." So this is a direct comparison between current results and cited results (CoCoRes). Then, the next part says "although conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima @@CITATION@." So this is comparing two studies (the cited ones) with conflicting results, which would be CoCoXY. Therefore, the two citations in the same sentence are being used for different comparisons. Wait, but the task is about the specific citation tagged @@CITATION@@. Wait, in the given passage, there are two citations: one for the deuterium experiments and another for the conflicting results in Euphorbia. Wait, looking back at the user's example input, perhaps the passage is similar to the CoCoXY example where two citations are compared. 

Wait, the user's example input might have a sentence like "Fast multiplication rates... (Wei et al., 2004; Saracco et al., 2006), although conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima @@CITATION@." So the @@CITATION@@ here refers to the conflicting results between two studies. Therefore, the citation is used to compare two cited studies (CoCoXY). 

So in this case, the main intent is CoCoXY because the citation is comparing two studies (the cited ones) with conflicting results. However, the first part of the sentence compares current results with another study (CoCoRes). But the task is about the specific @@CITATION@@ mentioned. Wait, the user's example might have multiple citations, but in the task, we're focusing on the @@CITATION@@ tagged in the passage. 

Assuming that the @@CITATION@@ in the user's passage refers to the conflicting results between two studies, then CoCoXY is the primary class. However, if the @@CITATION@@ refers to the comparison between current work and the deuterium experiments, then CoCoRes is primary. 

Given the example provided for CoCoXY mentions conflicting results between two cited studies and the citation is part of that sentence, it's likely that the @@CITATION@@ here is part of that comparison. Therefore, CoCoXY is the primary class. However, the initial part of the sentence comparing current results with another study's results would be CoCoRes. 

But since the task is to classify the specific @@CITATION@@ tagged in the passage, we need to determine which citation is tagged. If the @@CITATION@@ refers to the conflicting results between two studies (as in the example), then CoCoXY is first. If it refers to the comparison between current work and a study's results, then CoCoRes is first. 

Given the example provided by the user, the correct classification for the @@CITATION@@ in their example is CoCoXY. Therefore, in the user's task, if the @@CITATION@@ refers to the conflicting results between two studies, then CoCoXY is the primary class. Otherwise, if it's comparing current work to a study's results, CoCoRes is primary. 

Assuming the user's example is similar to the CoCoXY example, the primary class is CoCoXY. Then, maybe CoCoRes is secondary if there's another comparison in the same sentence. Wait, the example sentence has two comparisons: one between current work and a study (CoCoRes) and another between two cited studies (CoCoXY). Therefore, the citation tagged @@CITATION@@ in the user's passage is part of the CoCoXY comparison. 

Therefore, the top three classes would be CoCoXY as first, CoCoRes as second if there's a comparison between current work and another study, and Neutral as third if there's any descriptive part. However, the Neutral class is for citations that are purely descriptive without supporting or comparing. Since the citation here is part of a comparison between two studies, Neutral isn't applicable here. 

Wait, maybe the second class is CoCoRes if the citation is also part of a comparison between current work and another study. But in the example given, the CoCoXY is about comparing two cited studies, and CoCoRes is comparing current work with a cited study. If the user's passage has both comparisons in the same sentence, then the two citations would have different classes. But the task is to classify the specific @@CITATION@@ mentioned. 

Given the confusion, perhaps the primary class is CoCoXY, followed by CoCoRes if there's an additional comparison, but in the example provided, the two comparisons are separate. Therefore, the correct classification for the @@CITATION@@ in the user's passage is CoCoXY as first, CoCoRes as second if there's a comparison between current work and another study, and Neutral as third if applicable. However, since the example's @@CITATION@@ is part of the CoCoXY comparison, the primary class is CoCoXY. 

Therefore, the top three classes would be CoCoXY, CoCoRes, and Neutral. Wait, but Neutral isn't applicable here. Maybe the third class is something else. Alternatively, maybe the second class is Support if the citation is supporting a point, but in the example, it's a comparison. 

Hmm, perhaps the correct classification is CoCoXY as first, CoCoRes as second if there's another comparison in the same sentence, and Neutral as third. But I'm not entirely sure. Based on the example provided, the correct answer would be CoCoXY as first, CoCoRes as second, and Neutral as third. But Neutral might not be applicable here. 

Alternatively, maybe the second class is CoCoGM if comparing goals or methods, but the example is about results. Therefore, CoCoRes is second. 

In conclusion, based on the example provided, the correct classes are CoCoXY, CoCoRes, and Neutral.
