Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the task is to determine the top three rhetorical classes for the given citation in the scientific passage. The citation is marked as @@CITATION@@. First, I need to extract the context around the citation.

Looking at the passage provided, the sentence is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." 

So the key part here is that the authors are comparing their results with those from previous experiments. The phrase "substantially differ from the results" indicates a direct comparison of findings. According to the definitions, CoCoRes is used when the citation is comparing results or findings between the current work and the cited paper. 

Next step is identifying the general intent. Since they're contrasting their results with prior work, the intent is comparative, specifically about results. That points towards CoCoRes as the primary class.

Now, looking for other possible classes. The citation is directly comparing results, so CoCoRes is the main one. Are there other classes that might apply? The example for CoCoRes includes comparing results, so that's a solid fit. Could there be a Basis or Support? The Basis is about foundational work, but here it's a comparison, not establishing a foundation. Support would be if they're confirming their findings with prior work, but since they're stating differences, Support isn't right. 

What about CoCoXY? That's for comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies, not with the current paper. The example given for CoCoXY mentions comparing two cited studies, not the current one. So this doesn't fit here. 

Motivation or Future? The sentence isn't about why the research is done (Motivation) or suggesting future work (Future). Neutral is when it's just descriptive without argument, but here there's a clear comparison. 

So the primary class is CoCoRes. For the secondary classes, maybe Neutral? Wait, the example for Neutral is when the citation is just stating facts without argument. But here, the comparison is direct. However, maybe if there's a mention of other works in a neutral way? Wait, the example given for CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies, but in this case, it's comparing the current work with the cited. So CoCoRes is the main one. 

Are there any other classes? The example given in CoCoRes matches this case exactly. The sentence says "substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted... @@CITATION@." So this is a direct comparison of results between the current work and the cited paper. Therefore, CoCoRes is definitely the top. 

What about other possible classes? The third class could be Neutral if the citation is also just mentioning the existence of prior work. But the main intent is comparison. The example for Neutral is when the citation is used descriptively. However, in this case, the citation is part of a comparison, so Neutral might not be appropriate. Maybe CoCoGM or CoCoXY? No, because CoCoGM is about goals or methods, and CoCoXY is between two cited studies. 

Therefore, the top three would be CoCoRes as the first, then maybe Neutral if there's any descriptive use, but I'm not sure. Wait, the example for Neutral is when the citation is just stating a fact without argument. Here, the citation is part of a comparison of results. So Neutral might not apply. But maybe the third class is CoCoXY if there's another comparison. Wait, the example for CoCoXY involves comparing two cited studies. In the given sentence, it's comparing the current work with the cited study. So CoCoXY isn't applicable here. 

Therefore, the top three classes would be CoCoRes as the first, then maybe Neutral or another comparative class. But perhaps the third could be something else. Wait, maybe Support? No, because Support is when the citation supports the current findings, but here it's contrasting. 

Hmm. Maybe the third class is Neutral. But I'm not sure. Let me check again. The example for Neutral is when the citation is used descriptively. In the given sentence, the citation is part of a comparison of results, which is CoCoRes. So the top three would be CoCoRes as first, then maybe CoCoXY if there's another comparison. Wait, no. The example given for CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies, not the current paper. So in this case, it's a direct comparison between current work and cited work, so CoCoRes is the only applicable. Maybe the third class is Neutral? But Neutral is when there's no argument. Alternatively, maybe Weakness? No, because Weakness is when the citation is criticized. 

Hmm, perhaps the top three are CoCoRes, then maybe Basis if the cited work is foundational. But the example for Basis is when the cited work introduced a method. In this case, the cited work's results are being compared, not establishing a foundation. So Basis isn't applicable. 

Therefore, the top three would be CoCoRes as the first, then maybe Neutral as the second and third? Or perhaps CoCoRes is the only one, but the task requires three. Wait, the instructions say to output the top three even if there's only one clear class. Maybe the other two are Neutral or something else. 

Alternatively, perhaps the third class is CoCoGM. Wait, CoCoGM is comparing goals or methods. If the cited work's methods are being compared, but the sentence here is about results. So no. 

So the final answer would be CoCoRes as the first, Neutral as the second (if applicable), and maybe Basis as third. But I'm not certain. However, given the example in CoCoRes matches exactly, the primary class is CoCoRes. The next could be Neutral if the citation is also just stating the existence of prior work. But in the example given for Neutral, it's when the citation is used descriptively. Here, the citation is part of a comparison. So perhaps Neutral isn't applicable. 

Wait, maybe the third class is CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two cited works. But in this case, there's only one cited work. So CoCoXY isn't applicable. 

Hmm. Maybe the answer is CoCoRes as first, then maybe CoCoGM as second, but I don't see a comparison of goals or methods. Therefore, perhaps the third class is Neutral. But I'm not sure. Given the instructions require three classes, I'll have to pick the top three based on the available options. The primary is CoCoRes, then maybe Neutral and then another. Since I can't think of others, perhaps Neutral is the third. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, maybe the third is Basis. But again, not applicable. 

So the final answer is:

1. CoCoRes  
2. Neutral  
3. CoCoGM  

Wait, but why CoCoGM? Because the cited work's methods might be compared. Wait, the sentence says "experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets...", which could imply a comparison of methods. So CoCoGM could be applicable here as comparing methods. 

Yes, maybe the citation is comparing both results (CoCoRes) and methods (CoCoGM). So the first is CoCoRes, second is CoCoGM, third could be Neutral. 

But the example for CoCoGM is comparing goals or methods. The sentence mentions the experiments conducted with a certain method, so comparing methods. So CoCoGM is applicable. 

Therefore, the top three would be CoCoRes, CoCoGM, Neutral.
