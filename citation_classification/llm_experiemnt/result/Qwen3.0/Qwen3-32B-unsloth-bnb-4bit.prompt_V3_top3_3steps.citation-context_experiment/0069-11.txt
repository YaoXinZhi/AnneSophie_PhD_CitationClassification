Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the authors used a method from @@CITATION@@ to analyze plant samples. The key phrase here is "as previously described in @@CITATION@@", which indicates they're referencing a method they're using.

Next, determining the general intent. Since they're citing a method they're applying, this seems like a technical reference. The category for technical usage is "Usage". There's no comparison here with other works, nor is it supporting their own findings. They're just applying a method from the cited paper.

Looking at the rhetorical classes, "Usage" fits best because they're directly using the method from the cited work. There's no mention of results or goals, so CoCoGM or CoCoRes aren't relevant. The citation isn't supporting their own results either, so "Support" doesn't apply. The context is straightforward, so "Neutral" might be a secondary option if there's no clear intent, but since they're using the method directly, "Usage" is primary. Maybe "Support" could come in second if they're confirming their approach with existing methods, but the example given in "Usage" is more about the method being used. So the top three would be Usage, then perhaps Support if they're backing up their method choice, and Neutral as a fallback. Wait, the example for Support mentions confirming their work, but here they're using the method, not confirming results. So "Usage" is definitely first. Then maybe Neutral if there's no further intent. But the example for Neutral is descriptive without specific argument. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe Basis if it's foundational, but Basis is more about the intellectual foundation. Since they're using a method, Usage is primary. Then perhaps Support if they're supporting their method's validity, but the example for Support is about results. So maybe Neutral is second. Wait, the example for Neutral is about stating a fact. The citation here is stating they used a method as described. That could be Neutral. But the example for Usage is about experimental setup. So maybe Usage is first, then Neutral. But the user wants three classes. Let me check the definitions again. Usage is when the cited work's method/tool is directly used. Support is when the citation supports the citing authors' work. Here, they're using the method, so Usage is first. Then maybe Neutral if there's no other intent. But maybe there's a secondary intent. Wait, the example for Support says "support, or confirm the work, result or finding of the citing authors." If they're using a method that's been validated, maybe that's supporting their approach. But the example for Usage is about the setup, which is more direct. So Usage is first. Then maybe Support as second if they're implying the method is reliable. Neutral could be third. But I need to pick the top three. Let me go with Usage, then Neutral, then maybe Basis if it's foundational. Wait, Basis is when it's the intellectual foundation. Since the method is foundational to their current study, Basis could be second. But the example for Basis is introducing a concept. Here, it's about using a method. Hmm. Maybe Usage, then Basis, then Neutral. Alternatively, maybe the citation is providing the method they're using (Usage), and since it's a method they're applying, it's also supporting their approach (Support). Wait, Support is when the citation supports their findings. If they're using a method that's been used before, maybe that's supporting their methodology. But the example for Support is about results. So perhaps Support isn't the right fit here. Neutral might be better. So the top three would be Usage, Neutral, and maybe Basis. Wait, Basis is when the citation is the foundation of their research. If the method from the citation is the basis for their current work, then Basis could be second. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe CoCoGM if they're comparing methods, but they're not contrasting. The example for CoCoGM is comparing goals or methods. Here, they're just using the method without comparing. So probably Usage is first, then Neutral, then maybe Support. Let me check the example again. Usage example: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@." That's similar to the given passage. So Usage is first. Then Neutral if there's no other intent. Basis could be third if it's foundational. But maybe Neutral is second. The example for Neutral is stating a fact without argument. The given citation is stating they used a method as described, which is descriptive. So Neutral could be second. Then maybe Basis as third if the method is foundational. Alternatively, maybe Support isn't applicable here. So the top three would be Usage, Neutral, Basis.
