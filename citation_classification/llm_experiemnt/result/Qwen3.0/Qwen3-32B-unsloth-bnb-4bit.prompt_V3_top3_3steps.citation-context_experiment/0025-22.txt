Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. First, I need to look at the context around the citation marked @@CITATION@@. The passage says, "The effectiveness of the new pesticide was evaluated by comparing it with traditional methods described by @@CITATION@@." 

So, the citation here is being used to compare the new pesticide's effectiveness against traditional methods that the cited work described. The key word here is "comparing," which points towards a comparative intent. 

Looking at the general intent categories, Comparative falls under CoCoGM, CoCoRes, or CoCoXY. Since the comparison is between the methods (traditional vs. new), this would likely be CoCoGM, which is about comparing goals or methods. 

Now, checking the examples for CoCoGM: the example mentions comparing methods, which aligns with this citation's use. There's no direct comparison of results here, just the methods. Also, there's no mention of explaining or contrasting two cited studies with each other, so CoCoXY isn't fitting. 

Is there any other possible class? Maybe Support if the citation is supporting the comparison, but the example for Support shows it's used to confirm findings. Here, the citation is providing the basis for the comparison, not supporting the current study's findings. 

So the primary class is CoCoGM. Next, considering secondary classes. The citation is also providing a foundation for the current research by referencing traditional methods, which could relate to Basis. However, Basis is more about the intellectual foundation, not a method comparison. 

Alternatively, maybe Motivation if the citation is justifying why the comparison is made, but the example for Motivation talks about justifying the research due to a knowledge gap. Here, it's more about comparing methods rather than motivating the research. 

So the top classes would be CoCoGM first. Then, perhaps Support if the cited work's methods are being used as a benchmark, but the example for Support is about confirming results. Alternatively, Neutral if it's just a neutral reference. But the citation is actively used in a comparison, so Neutral is less likely. 

Wait, the example for Neutral is something like stating a fact without argument. Here, the citation is part of an evaluation, which is more active. So Neutral might not fit. 

Another possible secondary class is Similar if the methods are similar, but the example for Similar points out similarities in results or observations. Here, it's a comparison between methods, not necessarily similarity. 

So maybe the top three are CoCoGM (primary), then Basis (if the cited work is foundational for the methods being compared), and Neutral as a fallback. But Basis is about intellectual foundation. Since the citation is providing the traditional methods to compare against, maybe Basis isn't the best fit here. 

Alternatively, maybe Future isn't relevant here. Weakness also doesn't apply because the citation isn't being criticized. 

So perhaps the top three are CoCoGM, then maybe Similar (if the methods are similar), but I think the primary is CoCoGM. Maybe Neutral as third if there's no other fit. Wait, the example for CoCoGM includes contrasting goals or methods. The current citation is comparing methods, so CoCoGM is definitely first. 

Looking for secondary classes: maybe Support if the cited work's methods are being used as a standard. The example for Support is about confirming findings, so maybe not. 

Alternatively, maybe the citation is used as a basis for the comparison, which could be Basis. But Basis is more about the foundation of the current research, not the comparison itself. 

Hmm. Maybe the top three are CoCoGM, then Neutral, then Support. Wait, Neutral is when it's descriptive without argument. The citation is part of an evaluation, which is an argument, so Neutral might not fit. 

I think the correct top classes are CoCoGM first, then maybe Support if the cited work's methods are being supported by the comparison. But the example for Support is about confirming the citing authors' work. Here, the citation is providing the methods to compare against, not supporting the current findings. 

Alternatively, maybe the citation is being used to support the need for comparison, which could be Motivation. But the example for Motivation is about justifying the research due to a knowledge gap. 

This is tricky. The primary is definitely CoCoGM. For secondary, perhaps Basis if the cited work is foundational to the methods being compared. The example for Basis mentions introducing a method, so if the cited work introduced the traditional methods, then Basis could be second. 

Third could be Neutral if there's no other fit. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe Similar if the methods are similar, but the comparison is between different methods. 

I think the best answer is CoCoGM first, Basis second, and Neutral third. But I need to check the definitions again. Basis is when the citation is the intellectual foundation. If the cited work's methods are the traditional ones that the current study is building upon or comparing against, then Basis could be appropriate. 

Yes, in the example for Basis, they mention introducing a method. If the cited work introduced the traditional methods, then Basis is relevant. So the top three would be CoCoGM (comparison of methods), Basis (foundation for the methods), and maybe Support if the cited methods are being used as a benchmark. But Support's example is about confirming the citing authors' results, which isn't the case here. 

Alternatively, maybe the third is Neutral. So the final answer would be CoCoGM, Basis, Neutral.
