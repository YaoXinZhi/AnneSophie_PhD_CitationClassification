Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. First, I need to look at the context around the citation marked @@CITATION@@. The passage says, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." 

So the main point here is comparing the current results with those from another study. The key words are "substantially differ," which indicates a direct comparison of results. According to the definitions, CoCoRes is when the citation is used to compare or contrast results or findings. That seems like the primary class here.

Next, the example given for CoCoRes matches this scenario exactly. The authors are stating their results differ from previous experiments cited. So CoCoRes is definitely the top choice.

Now, looking for secondary classes. The other part of the sentence mentions the experiments with deuterium saturated metal targets. There's no indication of comparing goals or methods here, so CoCoGM might not apply. The citation isn't used to support their own findings, so Support is out. Neutral is when the citation is just descriptive without argument, but here it's a direct comparison. 

There's no mention of future work or weaknesses in the cited study, so Future and Weakness are unlikely. The comparison is straightforward between their results and the cited ones, so maybe Neutral isn't the best fit here either. 

The third class could be Neutral if there's a slight descriptive element, but since the primary intent is comparison, Neutral might be lower. Alternatively, if there's any indirect comparison between two cited studies without involving the current work, CoCoXY could come into play. However, the example for CoCoXY involves comparing two cited studies with each other, not with the current paper. Since the current example compares their results with the cited ones, CoCoRes is the main one, and CoCoXY isn't applicable here. 

So the top three would be CoCoRes as the primary, then maybe Neutral if there's a descriptive aspect, but I think Neutral is less likely. Wait, the example for Neutral is when the citation is just stating a fact without argument. In this case, the citation is part of a comparison, so Neutral isn't the best fit. Maybe the next could be CoCoGM or CoCoXY, but since there's no mention of goals or methods, those aren't applicable. The only other possibility is that the comparison is between two studies, but the example for CoCoXY requires comparing two cited studies with each other. Here, the comparison is between the current work and the cited one, so CoCoRes is the main, and the next could be Basis if the cited work is foundational, but the example here isn't about foundation. 

Hmm, maybe the second class is Neutral because the citation is just providing context without further argument. But the primary intent is comparison, so Neutral might not be appropriate. Alternatively, maybe the third class is CoCoXY if there's a mention of conflicting results between studies, but the example given in the task doesn't mention conflicting results between the cited study and another cited study. The example here is between the current work and the cited study. So CoCoXY isn't applicable. 

Therefore, the top three classes would be CoCoRes as the primary, then perhaps Neutral if there's a descriptive element, but I'm not sure. Wait, the example for Neutral is when the citation is just stating a fact. In the given passage, the citation is part of a comparison of results, so Neutral isn't the case here. Maybe the next classes are CoCoGM or CoCoXY, but since there's no mention of goals or methods, those are out. The only remaining options are Future, Support, Weakness, etc. 

Wait, perhaps the second class is Support? No, because Support is when the citation supports the authors' work, but here they're contrasting. So the only other possibility is Neutral. But I'm not sure. Maybe the citation is just providing context, hence Neutral. Alternatively, since the authors are stating their results differ, maybe Weakness is involved if they're pointing out a limitation, but the example for Weakness involves criticizing the cited work. Here, they're contrasting results without necessarily criticizing. 

Hmm, perhaps the top three are CoCoRes, then Neutral, then maybe CoCoGM or another class. But I think CoCoRes is the primary, Neutral might not be applicable here. Maybe the second class is Basis if the cited work is foundational, but the example here isn't about foundation. 

Wait, the example for Basis is when the cited work introduces a method or concept. In this case, the cited work's experiments are being compared, not establishing a foundation. So Basis isn't applicable. 

So the top three would be CoCoRes as first, then maybe Neutral as second, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the third class is CoCoXY if there's an indirect comparison between two cited studies. But the example given doesn't mention that. 

Given the information, the most accurate classification is CoCoRes as the primary class, followed by Neutral if there's a descriptive aspect, but I'm not entirely confident. However, based on the definitions provided, CoCoRes is definitely the primary, and the others are less clear. Maybe the next two are Neutral and then something else, but perhaps Neutral isn't the right fit. Given the ambiguity, I'll proceed with CoCoRes as first, then Neutral as second, and then maybe CoCoXY as third if there's any indirect comparison between two cited studies, but in this case, there's only one cited study being compared to the current work. Therefore, the third might be Neutral or another class. 

After reevaluating, the correct top three are CoCoRes, then Neutral, then maybe Basis. Wait, Basis is for foundational references. Since the cited work isn't establishing a foundation here but is being compared, Basis isn't right. 

Given all that, the final answer is CoCoRes as the primary class, then Neutral as the second, and then CoCoXY as the third, even though there's only one cited study mentioned. But since CoCoXY involves comparing two cited studies with each other, that's not applicable here. Therefore, the third class might be Neutral. 

But the example given for Neutral is when the citation is just stating a fact without argument. In this case, the citation is part of a comparison, so Neutral isn't appropriate. Maybe the third class is Weakness if the authors are pointing out a limitation in the cited work, but the passage states that their results differ, not that the cited work is flawed. 

Hmm, perhaps the correct top three are CoCoRes, then maybe Support or another class. Wait, Support is when the citation supports the authors' work. Here, they're contrasting, so Support isn't applicable. 

After considering all options, the most accurate classification is CoCoRes as the primary class, and the other two classes might not be clearly applicable. However, based on the definitions, the best possible options are CoCoRes, then Neutral, then CoCoXY. But given that CoCoXY isn't applicable here, perhaps Neutral is the second and third. 

Wait, the example for Neutral is when the citation is used in a neutral, descriptive way. In this case, the citation is part of a comparison, so Neutral isn't the right fit. Therefore, maybe the second class is CoCoGM or another. But since there's no mention of goals or methods, those are out. 

I think I need to stick with CoCoRes as the primary, and the next two might be Neutral and something else. However, given the ambiguity, the correct answer is CoCoRes as the first, then Neutral as the second, and maybe CoCoXY as the third. But since CoCoXY isn't applicable, perhaps Neutral is the second and third. 

In conclusion, the top three classes are CoCoRes, then Neutral, then CoCoXY. But I'm not entirely sure. However, based on the definitions provided, CoCoRes is the primary, and the others might not fit. So the final answer is CoCoRes, Neutral, CoCoXY.
