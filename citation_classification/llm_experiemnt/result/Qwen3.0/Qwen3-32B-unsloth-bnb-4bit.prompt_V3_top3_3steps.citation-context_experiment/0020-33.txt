Okay, let me try to work through this step by step. So, the task is to figure out the top three rhetorical classes for the given citation in the passage. First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage provided is:

"The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@."

Alright, the citation is being used to compare the results of the current study with those from another study that used deuterium-saturated metal targets. The key phrase here is "substantially differ," which indicates a direct comparison of results. 

Looking at the definitions, CoCoRes is when the citation is used to compare or contrast results. That seems like the primary class here. Then, I need to see if there's another comparison happening. The example given for CoCoRes matches this scenario where results are compared. 

Next, are there other possible classes? Maybe CoCoGM or CoCoXY? Let's see. CoCoGM is about comparing goals or methods. The passage mentions the methods used in the cited work (deuterium saturated metal targets), but the main comparison is about the results. So maybe CoCoGM is secondary? Wait, the sentence is contrasting results, not methods or goals. So CoCoGM might not be the right fit here. 

What about CoCoXY? That's for comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies, not with the current paper. In the example given for CoCoXY, they compare two studies. Here, the comparison is between the current work and the cited study, so CoCoXY isn't applicable. 

Is there a foundational aspect? The Basis class is when the citation is the intellectual foundation. The passage isn't referencing foundational work but contrasting results. So Basis is probably not relevant here. 

Motivation or Future? The citation isn't justifying why the current research was done or suggesting future work. It's pointing out a difference in results. Support or Similar? The passage isn't supporting their findings with the citation; it's contrasting. So Support and Similar are out. 

Usage? The citation isn't about using a method from the cited work. Weakness? The cited work isn't being criticized here, just that the results differ. Neutral? The citation is being used in a descriptive way but with a direct comparison. Neutral might be a lower-ranked class here if there's no strong support or criticism. 

So the primary class is CoCoRes. The secondary could be Neutral if the comparison is just a factual statement without supporting or criticizing. But maybe there's another layer. Wait, the example for CoCoRes includes phrases like "substantially differ," which matches the passage. Neutral is when the citation is neutral, not supporting or comparing. However, since the comparison is explicit, Neutral might not be the second. Wait, perhaps the next class is CoCoXY? No, because CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a Basis element if the cited work is foundational to their comparison. But the cited work here is a previous experiment with different results, not foundational. 

So the top three classes would be CoCoRes as primary, then maybe Neutral if there's no other clear class, but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe the second could be CoCoGM if the methods are different. The cited work used different targets (deuterium saturated), so maybe comparing methods. The phrase "experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets" refers to their methods. So perhaps CoCoGM is applicable here as a secondary class because they're contrasting methods. 

So the first is CoCoRes (results comparison), second CoCoGM (methods comparison), and third Neutral if there's no other. But Neutral might not be the case here. Wait, the example for Neutral is when the citation is just descriptive. In this case, the citation is actively being used to compare results and methods. So maybe Neutral isn't applicable here. Hmm. 

Alternatively, maybe the third is Basis if the cited work is foundational to the current study's comparison. But since they're contrasting results, Basis might not fit. 

So perhaps the top three are CoCoRes, CoCoGM, and Neutral. But I'm a bit uncertain about Neutral. Let me check the example again. Neutral example is when the citation is used neutrally without supporting or comparing. In the given passage, the citation is being used to compare results and possibly methods, so Neutral might not be appropriate. Maybe the third is Basis? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps Weakness if the cited work's results are considered a problem. But the passage says the results differ, not that they're flawed. 

So I think the top three are CoCoRes (primary), CoCoGM (secondary), and maybe Neutral as third. Wait, but Neutral is when it's just descriptive. The citation here is being used to contrast results, which is a direct comparison, so Neutral might not be correct. Maybe the third is CoCoXY? No, because that's comparing two cited studies. 

I'm a bit stuck. Let me go back. The primary is definitely CoCoRes. The secondary could be CoCoGM if the methods are compared. The cited study's methods are mentioned (deuterium saturated targets), and the current study's results differ from those experiments. So CoCoGM would be comparing methods. So CoCoRes (results comparison) and CoCoGM (methods comparison). Then, Neutral would be third if there's no other. But Neutral might not fit. Alternatively, maybe the third is Basis? Not really. 

I think the top three are CoCoRes, CoCoGM, and Neutral. But Neutral might not be right. Wait, the Neutral example is about when the citation is used neutrally, like stating a fact without argument. In this case, the citation is being used to contrast results, which is a direct comparison. So Neutral isn't applicable here. Therefore, maybe the third is Basis? No. 

Hmm. Perhaps the third is CoCoXY? But that's comparing two cited studies. The example given for CoCoXY is comparing two studies, not the current one. So CoCoXY isn't applicable here. 

So maybe the top three are CoCoRes and CoCoGM, and then Neutral isn't applicable. Wait, but I need three classes. Maybe the third is Basis? No. Alternatively, maybe Weakness? The cited work's results are different, but that's not a weakness unless the current study is pointing out flaws. Since the passage says "substantially differ," not that the cited work is flawed. 

So perhaps the top three are CoCoRes, CoCoGM, and Neutral. Even if Neutral isn't perfect, maybe that's the best fit given the options. Alternatively, maybe the third is Future? No. 

I think the correct ranking is CoCoRes as first, CoCoGM as second, and Neutral as third. Even though Neutral is a bit off, given the options, that's the best fit.
