Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation marked @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." 

So the key part here is comparing the results of the current study with those from the cited work. The phrase "substantially differ from the results" indicates a direct comparison of findings. Looking at the definitions, CoCoRes is when the citation is used to compare results. That seems like the primary class here.

Next, is there any other comparison? The example given for CoCoRes mentions comparing results, which matches. Are there any other classes that might apply? Maybe CoCoXY if they're comparing explanations, but the sentence is specifically talking about results, not explanations or claims between studies. Also, there's no mention of contrasting with the current paper's methods or goals, so CoCoGM isn't applicable here. 

The citation isn't supporting the current work's findings (so not Support), nor is it a basis for the research. It's also not pointing out weaknesses or suggesting future work. The main intent is to highlight a difference in results. 

So the top class is definitely CoCoRes. Then, maybe Neutral if there's no other intent, but the example for Neutral is more about neutral description. However, the sentence is making a direct comparison, so Neutral might not be the second. Wait, looking at the example for CoCoRes again, it's similar. The example given is comparing results, so CoCoRes is the primary. Since there's a direct comparison of results, the second could be CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two cited studies, but in this case, the comparison is between the current work and the cited work. So CoCoRes is the main one. 

Wait, the example for CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies, not the current paper and a cited one. Here, the comparison is between present work and the cited work. So CoCoRes is correct. Then, maybe Neutral as the third if there's no other intent. But the example for Neutral is more about stating facts without comparison. Since the citation here is used to contrast results, Neutral might not be appropriate. Alternatively, maybe there's another class. Let me check the definitions again. 

The options are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Motivation, Future, Support, Similar, Usage, Weakness, Neutral. Since the citation is contrasting results, CoCoRes is first. Then, maybe Similar isn't applicable here because it's a difference, not similarity. CoCoXY would be if comparing two cited studies, which isn't the case. So maybe Neutral is the third, but I'm not sure. Wait, the example for Neutral is a statement of fact without supporting or comparing. In this case, the citation is used to compare results, so Neutral might not be the second or third. Hmm. Maybe the second is CoCoXY if there's any comparison between two cited studies, but the example here is comparing the current study with one cited work. So perhaps CoCoRes is first, then maybe Neutral as the second? Or maybe there's no second class. Wait, the task says to rank the top three, even if some are less applicable. So after CoCoRes, perhaps Neutral or another class. Alternatively, maybe CoCoXY isn't applicable here. 

So the top three would be CoCoRes as first, then maybe Neutral if there's no other comparison. But the example for Neutral is more like stating a fact without any argument. In this case, the citation is part of a comparison, so Neutral might not fit. Alternatively, maybe there's no second class. Wait, the instructions say to output exactly three, so perhaps CoCoRes is first, then Neutral as second, and maybe another? Or maybe CoCoRes is the only one, but I have to list three. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The example given for CoCoRes is exactly matching the scenario here. So CoCoRes is the top. Then, maybe Neutral as the second if there's a neutral mention. But the sentence is making a comparison, so Neutral might not apply. Alternatively, maybe there's no second class. But the task requires three. Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the example again. The example for CoCoRes is "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." Which matches exactly the given passage. So CoCoRes is definitely first. The other classes would be... Well, maybe Neutral if there's no other intent. But Neutral is when it's descriptive without supporting, comparing, etc. Since the citation here is part of a comparison, Neutral isn't applicable. Maybe the next could be CoCoGM if there's a comparison of goals or methods, but the sentence is about results. So perhaps CoCoRes is first, then maybe CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two cited works, but the example here is between current and cited. Therefore, CoCoRes is first, then maybe Neutral as the second. Wait, but Neutral is when it's descriptive. Maybe in this case, after comparing results, the citation is also being used in a descriptive way. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the second is CoCoXY. Wait, CoCoXY is comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies. Since this is comparing current study with cited, CoCoXY isn't applicable. Therefore, the top three would be CoCoRes as first, then maybe Neutral as second, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe there's no second and third. But the task requires three. Maybe I'm forced to include Neutral as the third even if it's not perfect. So the answer would be:

1. CoCoRes  
2. Neutral  
3. CoCoGM  

Wait, but why CoCoGM? Unless there's a comparison of goals or methods. The passage here is comparing results, not goals or methods. So maybe CoCoGM isn't applicable. Hmm. Maybe the third is Neutral. So the final answer would be:

1. CoCoRes  
2. Neutral  
3. CoCoXY  

But again, CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies, which isn't the case here. Maybe the third is Neutral. I think the correct answer is CoCoRes as first, then Neutral as second, and maybe another. Wait, maybe there's no second class. Maybe the task allows for only one relevant class and the others are less relevant. But the instructions say to list three. I'm a bit stuck here. Let me recheck the definitions again. 

The task says to assign three fined-grained classes. The example given for CoCoRes is exactly matching the passage. So CoCoRes is the top. The next could be Neutral if the citation is also being used in a descriptive way. But the passage is making a comparison, so Neutral might not fit. Alternatively, maybe there's no second class, but the instructions require three. Perhaps the user expects CoCoRes, then maybe Similar if there's a similarity mentioned. But the passage says "substantially differ," which is the opposite. So Similar is out. Hmm. Maybe the answer is CoCoRes, then maybe Neutral, then maybe Weakness. Wait, Weakness is when criticizing the cited work. The passage is comparing results but not criticizing. So Weakness is out. 

Given all that, the most accurate answer is CoCoRes as first, then maybe Neutral as second, and perhaps CoCoXY as third, even if it's not perfect. Alternatively, maybe Neutral is the third. But I'm not confident. Given the example, CoCoRes is the only clear one. Maybe the other two are Neutral and something else. But I think the correct answer is CoCoRes first, then Neutral as second, and maybe CoCoGM third. But I'm not sure. I'll proceed with CoCoRes as first, Neutral as second, and CoCoXY as third, even though it's not perfect.
