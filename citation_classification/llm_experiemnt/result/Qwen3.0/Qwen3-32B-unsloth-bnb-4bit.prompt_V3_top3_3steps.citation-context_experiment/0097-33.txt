Okay, let me try to work through this step by step. The task is to determine the top three rhetorical classes for the given citation in the passage. First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." 

So the context here is comparing the results of the current study with those from previous experiments that used deuterium-saturated metal targets. The key phrase is "substantially differ from the results," which indicates a direct comparison of findings.

Next, identifying the general intent. The authors are contrasting their results with prior work, which points towards a comparative intent. According to the guidelines, comparative intent falls under CoCoRes, CoCoGM, or CoCoXY. Since the comparison here is about the results themselves, not the methods or explanations, CoCoRes is the most fitting category here. 

Now, looking at the specific classes. The example given for CoCoRes is exactly similar to the passage's structure, where results are directly compared. There's no mention of contrasting methods or goals, so CoCoGM isn't applicable. Also, there's no comparison between two cited studies, so CoCoXY is out. 

For the second and third places, maybe Neutral or Basis could be considered, but the passage is clearly making a direct comparison of results. There's no foundational reference or support here. The citation isn't used to justify the current research (Motivation) or to suggest future work (Future). The primary use is CoCoRes. The other possible classes might be CoCoXY if there were a comparison between two cited works, but that's not the case here. So Neutral could be third if there's any neutral mention, but the context is clearly comparative. Wait, maybe Neutral isn't applicable here. Alternatively, if there's no other intent beyond CoCoRes, perhaps the next could be Basis or Support, but the example doesn't support the current findings; it contrasts them. So maybe the next classes are Neutral and Weakness? Wait, the passage doesn't criticize the cited work; it just states differences. So Weakness might not apply. Neutral would be if it's just descriptive, but the comparison is active. Hmm. Maybe the top three are CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral or Basis. Wait, the example for CoCoRes is exactly matching, so CoCoRes is definitely first. The second could be CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two studies, but here it's between the current work and the cited work. So CoCoXY is not applicable. Then maybe the next classes are Neutral or Basis. But the passage isn't using the citation as a foundation. So perhaps Neutral is third. But Neutral is when it's descriptive without any argument. Since the citation is used to contrast results, maybe Neutral isn't the second. Maybe the second is CoCoGM? Wait, the comparison is about results, not goals or methods. So CoCoRes is first. The second could be Neutral if there's any neutral mention, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe there's no second class applicable beyond CoCoRes. Wait, the task requires three classes. So perhaps CoCoRes is first, then maybe Neutral as a fallback, and then maybe CoCoGM or another. But I need to check the definitions again. 

Wait, the citation is used to compare the current results with previous ones. So CoCoRes is definitely first. The second could be CoCoXY if comparing two cited studies, but here it's the current work vs. the cited. So CoCoXY isn't applicable. Maybe Neutral is third if there's any neutral use, but the context is clearly comparative. Alternatively, maybe the second could be Support if the citation is supporting the current claim of difference. Wait, Support is when the citation supports the citing authors' work. Here, the citation is contrasting, not supporting. So maybe Neutral is third. But Neutral is when the citation is used in a descriptive way without argument. Since the citation is part of a comparison, maybe Neutral isn't the best fit. Hmm. Maybe the top three are CoCoRes, then Neutral, then maybe Basis. But Basis is foundational, which isn't the case here. Alternatively, maybe there's no second class beyond CoCoRes. Wait, the task requires three classes. Maybe I need to think again. 

The example given for CoCoRes is exactly like the passage's structure. So CoCoRes is first. The second could be CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two cited works, but there isn't here. So maybe Neutral. Neutral is when the citation is used descriptively. But the passage is actively comparing results, so Neutral might not be second. Alternatively, maybe the second is CoCoGM, but the comparison is about results, not goals or methods. Hmm. Maybe the second is Weakness if the cited work's results are being criticized, but the passage doesn't criticize; it just states differences. So Weakness isn't right. Maybe Neutral is third. But Neutral would be if the citation is just mentioned without any argument. Since the citation is part of a direct comparison, Neutral might not be appropriate. Wait, maybe the second class is Basis. Basis is when the citation is the foundation. But here, the citation is being compared, not as a foundation. So perhaps the top three are CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral, then maybe Basis. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the second is CoCoGM, but that's about goals or methods. Since the passage mentions experiments with different targets, maybe there's a method comparison. Wait, the cited work used deuterium-saturated metal targets, and the current work's experiments differ. So maybe there's a comparison of methods (CoCoGM) as well. Wait, the passage says "results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets" which refers to the method (using those targets) and the results. The comparison is about results, not methods. So CoCoGM is not applicable here. Therefore, CoCoRes is first, then maybe Neutral as a fallback, but Neutral doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the second is CoCoXY if comparing explanations, but the passage is comparing results. Hmm. I think CoCoRes is the only applicable one here. But the task requires three classes. Maybe the next two are Neutral and Basis, but I'm not confident. Wait, maybe the second is CoCoXY if the cited work is part of a comparison between two studies. Wait, the example for CoCoXY mentions conflicting results between two studies. In the given passage, the current work is comparing with the cited work's results. So if the cited work is one of two studies being compared, but in this case, it's the current work vs. the cited work. So CoCoXY is not applicable. Therefore, the top three are CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral, then maybe Basis. But Neutral might not be right. Alternatively, perhaps the second is Support, but the citation isn't supporting the current work's claim; it's contrasting. Hmm. This is tricky. Maybe the answer is CoCoRes first, then Neutral, then Basis. But I'm not certain. Wait, the example for CoCoRes is exactly matching, so CoCoRes is definitely first. The second could be CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two cited works, but there isn't. Maybe Neutral is third, but Neutral is when the citation is used in a descriptive way. Since the citation is part of a comparison, Neutral might not fit. Alternatively, maybe the second is Basis, but that's not the case here. I think I need to stick with CoCoRes as first, then maybe Neutral as a fallback, even though it's not perfect. Alternatively, maybe the second is CoCoGM if the methods are being compared. Wait, the cited work used deuterium-saturated targets, and the current work's experiments differ. So maybe there's a comparison of methods (CoCoGM). But the passage states that the results differ, not the methods. The methods part is just describing what the cited work did. The comparison is about results. Therefore, CoCoRes is first. Maybe the second is CoCoGM if the methods are different, but the passage doesn't explicitly compare methods. Hmm. I think CoCoRes is the only applicable one here, but the task requires three. Maybe Neutral is third. So the answer would be:

1. CoCoRes  
2. Neutral  
3. Basis  

But I'm not entirely sure about Neutral and Basis. Alternatively, maybe the second is CoCoXY. Wait, no, CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies. So Neutral might be the second. Alternatively, maybe Weakness if the cited work's results are being questioned, but the passage doesn't do that. I think I'll go with CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral as second, and then Basis as third, even though I'm not certain.
