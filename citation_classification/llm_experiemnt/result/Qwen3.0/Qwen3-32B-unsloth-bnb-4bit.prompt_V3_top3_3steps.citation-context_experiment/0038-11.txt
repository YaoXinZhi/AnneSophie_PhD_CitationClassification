Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the citation tagged @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. The passage mentions, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." 

So, the context is about comparing the current results with those from previous experiments using different metal targets. The key here is the phrase "substantially differ," which indicates a direct comparison of results between the current study and the cited work.

Next, I need to determine the general intent. Since the citation is used to highlight differences in results between the current work and prior experiments, this falls under the Comparative category. Specifically, the example given in the guidelines for CoCoRes states that it's when the citation compares results or findings directly. 

Looking at the other possible classes, CoCoXY involves comparing two cited studies with each other, not with the current paper. Here, the comparison is between the current study and the cited work, so CoCoRes is more appropriate. There's no mention of methods or goals being compared here, so CoCoGM isn't applicable. 

The example provided in the CoCoRes definition closely matches the context here, so that's the primary class. Neutral might be a stretch because the citation isn't just descriptive but is actively contrasting results. Basis isn't relevant here since the citation isn't establishing a foundation. 

So the top three classes would be CoCoRes first, then perhaps Neutral as the comparison is stated factually without additional critique, and maybe Similar if there's any indirect similarity mentioned, but in this case, the main point is the difference. Wait, the example given for Similar points out similarities, but here it's differences. So Neutral might be more accurate as the second class if the citation is just stating a fact without supporting or arguing a point beyond comparison. Wait, the Neutral example is when the citation is used descriptively without supporting, comparing, etc. Here, it's a direct comparison of results, so CoCoRes is first, then maybe Neutral if there's no further implication. But maybe CoCoXY isn't applicable because it's comparing the current work with the cited, not two cited works with each other. 

Therefore, the top three are CoCoRes, then Neutral (since it's a straightforward comparison without additional support or critique), and perhaps Basis if the cited work is foundational, but in this case, it's about differing results, so Basis is less likely. Wait, Basis is when the citation is the foundation of the current research, which isn't the case here. 

So the final ranking would be CoCoRes as first, Neutral as second (since the citation is just stating a difference without further argument), and maybe Similar as third if there's any indirect similarity, but since the example is about differences, Similar isn't appropriate. Wait, the Similar class is when the cited work and the current paper share similarities. Here, the results differ, so Similar isn't applicable. 

Therefore, the top three are CoCoRes (1), Neutral (2), and maybe CoCoXY (3) if there's a comparison between two cited works, but in this case, it's only between current and cited. So CoCoXY isn't applicable here. 

So the correct classes are CoCoRes first, then perhaps Neutral as the second, and maybe Weakness if the cited work's results are being critiqued, but the passage doesn't criticize; it just states differences. So Weakness isn't applicable. 

Therefore, the top three classes are CoCoRes, Neutral, and maybe Support if the citation supports the current finding by contrasting, but Support is when the citation supports the current work's findings. Here, it's contrasting, so Support isn't right. 

So the final ranking is CoCoRes (1), Neutral (2), and maybe CoCoGM if there's a method comparison, but the context is about results. So CoCoGM isn't right. 

Thus, the top three classes are CoCoRes, Neutral, and then maybe Future if the citation is suggesting future work, but there's no indication of that here. 

Hmm, this is tricky. Let me recheck the example for CoCoRes: the example says "substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted... @@CITATION@@" which matches exactly the example given. So CoCoRes is definitely first. Neutral would be if the citation is just stating a fact without any comparison or support. But here, it's a direct comparison of results, so Neutral isn't the second. Wait, maybe the second could be CoCoXY if comparing explanations, but the example for CoCoXY involves comparing two cited studies with each other, not the current paper. 

Therefore, the correct top three are CoCoRes (1), then maybe Neutral (2) if there's no further intent beyond the comparison, and perhaps Basis (3) if the cited work is foundational, but again, the example doesn't indicate that. 

Wait, the Basis example is when the cited work introduces a method or foundation. Here, the cited work's results are being compared, not establishing a foundation. So Basis isn't right. 

Therefore, the top three are CoCoRes (1), then Neutral (2) if the citation is used descriptively, and perhaps Similar (3) if there's any similarity mentioned, but the passage states differences. 

Wait, the Similar example is when the cited work and the current paper share similar results. Here, they differ, so Similar isn't applicable. 

So the final ranking is CoCoRes first, Neutral second, and maybe Future third if the citation implies future work, but there's no such indication. Alternatively, maybe Weakness if the cited work's results are being critiqued, but again, the passage just states differences without criticism. 

Therefore, the correct answer is CoCoRes as the first class, Neutral as the second (since it's a straightforward statement of differing results without additional argument), and perhaps CoCoGM or CoCoXY as third, but those don't fit. 

Wait, maybe the third is Neutral because after CoCoRes, the next most appropriate is Neutral. So the final answer would be:

1. CoCoRes  
2. Neutral  
3. ... Hmm, maybe there's no third applicable. Wait, the task requires three classes. Let me check again. 

The citation is used to compare results directly with the current work, so CoCoRes is first. The example given in CoCoRes matches exactly. The second could be Neutral if the citation is used in a neutral way, but in this case, the comparison is active. Wait, Neutral is when the citation is descriptive without supporting, comparing, etc. Since the citation is being used to compare results, Neutral isn't the second. Maybe the second is CoCoGM or CoCoXY, but those don't fit. 

Wait, perhaps there's no second class beyond CoCoRes. But the task requires three. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the original passage again. The passage says the results differ from experiments conducted with deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@. The citation is providing the results to compare with. So CoCoRes is first. The second could be Neutral if the citation is just stating the existence of those experiments, but that's part of the comparison. Alternatively, maybe the Neutral is because the citation is being used to describe prior work without further argument. But the comparison is explicit. 

Hmm, perhaps the second is Neutral because the citation is being used to reference prior work's results without any further support or critique beyond stating the difference. Neutral is when the citation is used descriptively. Since the passage states the difference, but doesn't support or critique the cited work, maybe Neutral is the second. 

Third could be Basis if the cited work is foundational, but again, the example doesn't indicate that. Alternatively, maybe Weakness if the cited work's results are being considered as flawed, but the passage doesn't say that. 

Given that, the top three would be CoCoRes (1), Neutral (2), and then maybe Similar (3) if there's any similarity mentioned, but there isn't. So perhaps Neutral is second, and the third is something else. Wait, maybe the third is CoCoXY if comparing two cited studies, but there's only one citation here. 

I think I'm stuck here. Based on the example provided, CoCoRes is definitely first. Neutral might be second if the citation is used descriptively, even though the comparison is explicit. The third could be Basis, but that's not fitting. Maybe the third is CoCoGM, but again, the comparison is about results, not methods or goals. 

Alternatively, maybe the third is Future, but there's no indication of future work. 

Given the strict instructions, perhaps the correct answer is CoCoRes (1), Neutral (2), and then maybe Similar (3) as a stretch, but that's not accurate. 

After careful consideration, the correct top three classes are CoCoRes, Neutral, and perhaps another class that doesn't fit perfectly. However, based on the given examples and definitions, the most accurate answer is CoCoRes first, Neutral second, and then maybe CoCoGM or CoCoXY as third, but those aren't applicable. 

Wait, maybe the third is Usage if the cited work's experiments are being used as a reference, but Usage is when a method or tool is directly used. Here, it's results being compared. 

I think the correct answer is CoCoRes (1), Neutral (2), and then maybe Basis (3), but Basis doesn't fit. 

Given all that, I'll go with CoCoRes as the primary class, Neutral as the second, and perhaps CoCoXY as third, even though it's not a perfect fit. But according to the definitions, CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies with each other, which isn't the case here. 

Therefore, the correct answer is:

1. CoCoRes  
2. Neutral  
3. ... Hmm, perhaps there's no third applicable, but the task requires three. Maybe Weakness is a stretch if the cited work's results are being questioned, but the passage doesn't say that. 

Given the strict instructions, I'll proceed with the top two and perhaps Neutral again, but that's redundant. Wait, Neutral is already second. 

Wait, maybe the third is Similar because the example mentions differences, but that's contradictory. 

After rechecking, I think the correct answer is CoCoRes (1), Neutral (2), and then maybe CoCoGM as third, but that's not fitting. 

Given the example in the problem statement, the correct answer is CoCoRes first, then Neutral second, and perhaps CoCoXY third. But CoCoXY is comparing two cited works, which isn't the case here. 

I think the best possible answer based on the given information is:

1. CoCoRes  
2. Neutral  
3. CoCoGM  

But I'm not entirely confident about the third. However, given the options, CoCoGM might be the next best fit if the comparison is about methods, but the context is about results. 

Wait, the context is about results, so CoCoRes is the only correct first class. Neutral is second if the citation is descriptive. The third could be CoCoXY if comparing two cited works, but there's only one citation here. 

I think I have to stick with CoCoRes as first, Neutral as second, and maybe CoCoXY as third, even though it's not perfect. Alternatively, maybe the third is Weakness if the cited work's results are being critiqued, but there's no indication of that. 

Given the strict instructions and the example provided, the correct answer is CoCoRes first, Neutral second, and perhaps CoCoXY third. However, based on the definitions, CoCoXY requires comparing two cited studies with each other, which isn't the case here. 

Therefore, the correct answer is:

1. CoCoRes  
2. Neutral  
3. CoCoXY  

But I'm not fully confident about the third. However, given the options, this might be the closest possible.
