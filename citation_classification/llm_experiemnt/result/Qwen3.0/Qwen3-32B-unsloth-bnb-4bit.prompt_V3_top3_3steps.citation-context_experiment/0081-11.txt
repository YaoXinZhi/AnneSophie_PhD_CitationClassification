Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the citation marked @@CITATION@@. The passage provided is:

"@@CITATION@@ demonstrated that the application of a magnetic field to hard water can prevent the formation of hard calcite scale on surfaces. Building on these findings, our research aims to investigate the underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon."

So the citation is used to reference a previous study that showed magnetic fields prevent calcite scale. The next sentence says the current research is building on those findings to investigate mechanisms. 

Next, I need to determine the general intent. The first part of the sentence is foundational because it's citing prior work that the current study is based on. The phrase "Building on these findings" suggests motivation, as it's justifying why the current research is being conductedâ€”to explore the mechanisms behind the previously observed effect. 

Now, looking at the rhetorical classes: Basis would fit because the citation introduces foundational work. Motivation is also applicable since it's explaining why the current study is needed. Support could be considered if the citation is backing up the current claims, but here it's more about the basis and motivation. 

The top three classes would be Basis, Motivation, and maybe Support if there's confirmation, but in this case, Support isn't the primary intent. The example given for Motivation includes citing previous work to justify current research, which aligns here. So Basis and Motivation are the top two. There's no direct comparison with other studies, so CoCo classes aren't relevant here. Neutral might be considered if it's just stating facts, but since it's building on previous work, it's more than just descriptive. So the top three are Basis, Motivation, and perhaps Support if there's confirmation, but the example for Support mentions consistency with previous results. Here, the current work is extending the previous findings, not confirming them. So maybe Support isn't the best fit. Wait, the example for Support says "consistent with previous research," but here it's "building on" which is more about motivation. So Basis and Motivation are the primary classes, and maybe Neutral if there's no argumentative intent. But Neutral is when the citation is just descriptive without supporting or motivating. However, since the citation is foundational and motivating, Basis and Motivation are more accurate. The third class could be Support if the citation is supporting the current work's premise, but the example for Support is about consistency. Alternatively, maybe Neutral if it's just stating prior work. Hmm. Let me check the definitions again. Support is when the cited work confirms the current authors' work. Here, the cited work's findings are the basis for the current study's investigation into mechanisms. So Basis is the foundation, Motivation is why the current study is done. The third could be Support if the citation's results are being used to support the current study's premise, but the example for Support is about consistency. In this case, the current study is building on the findings, which might imply that the previous findings support the need for the current study. So maybe Support is the third. Alternatively, Neutral if it's just stating prior work. But since the citation is being used to justify the current research's motivation, Motivation is more fitting. So the top three would be Basis, Motivation, and maybe Support or Neutral. Let me think again. The example for Support says "consistent with previous research," but here it's building on findings, which is more about extending them rather than confirming. So perhaps the third is Neutral. Wait, Neutral is when the citation is used neutrally without supporting, comparing, etc. But in this case, the citation is both foundational and motivating. So Basis and Motivation are the top two. For the third, maybe there's no clear third class, but perhaps Weakness if the cited work has limitations. However, the passage doesn't mention any limitations. So Neutral might be the third. But the example for Neutral is just stating a fact without argument. Since the citation here is used to state prior work that the current study is building on, Neutral could be appropriate as the third. Alternatively, maybe there's no third class beyond Basis and Motivation. But the task requires three. Hmm. Let me check the definitions again. The example for Support is "consistent with previous research," which isn't exactly what's happening here. The example for Motivation includes citing previous work to justify current research, which fits here. Basis is the foundation. So the top three would be Basis, Motivation, and maybe Support if the citation supports the current work's premise. Alternatively, Neutral. Since the citation is foundational and motivating, perhaps the third is Neutral. Wait, Neutral is when the citation is descriptive without supporting, comparing, etc. The example given for Neutral is about the spread of magnetic water treatment devices. In our case, the citation is stating prior findings, which is descriptive but also foundational and motivating. So Neutral might not fit. Maybe the third is CoCoGM or CoCoRes if there's a comparison, but there isn't. So the top three are Basis, Motivation, and Support. Wait, Support is when the cited work supports the current authors' work. Here, the cited work's findings are the basis for the current study's motivation. So maybe Support isn't the right third class. Perhaps the third is Neutral. Alternatively, maybe Weakness isn't applicable. Hmm. Let me go back. The example for Motivation includes citing previous work to show that a phenomenon was observed but the mechanism isn't understood, hence motivating the current study. That's exactly our case. So Motivation is the second class. Basis is the first. The third could be Support if the cited work's results are being used to support the current study's premise. However, Support is about confirming the current findings. Since the current study is building on the previous findings to investigate mechanisms, perhaps Support isn't the right fit. Maybe Neutral is the third. Alternatively, maybe there's no third class beyond Basis and Motivation. But the task requires three. Maybe the third is CoCoGM if there's a comparison of goals or methods, but there's no mention of that. So perhaps Neutral is the third. The example for Neutral is stating a fact without argument. So the citation here is stating prior work (Neutral), but also serving as Basis and Motivation. So Neutral would be the third. Therefore, the top three are Basis, Motivation, Neutral.
