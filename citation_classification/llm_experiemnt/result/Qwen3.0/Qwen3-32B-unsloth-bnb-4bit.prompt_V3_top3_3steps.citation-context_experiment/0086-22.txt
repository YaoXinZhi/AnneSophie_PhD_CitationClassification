Okay, let's start by looking at the context around the citation. The sentence says, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." 

First, I need to extract the relevant part. The key part is where they mention that their results differ from previous experiments using specific metal targets cited here. 

Next, determine the general intent. The phrase "substantially differ" indicates a comparison of results between the current study and the cited work. According to the definitions, this would fall under Comparative â†’ CoCoRes. 

Now, checking the examples for CoCoRes: the example given is similar, where results are compared directly. There's no mention of contrasting explanations or methods here, so CoCoRes is the primary class. 

Looking for secondary classes: Maybe there's a hint of Neutral if there's no strong support or criticism, but the main action here is comparison of results. Since the example provided in CoCoRes matches closely, that's the top choice. 

Third class could be CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two cited studies, but in this case, the citation is only one study being compared to the current work. So Neutral might come in as the third if the citation is just stating a fact without additional support or motivation. 

So the top three would be CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral or Weakness. Wait, there's no criticism here, just a difference in results. Neutral is when the citation is descriptive without supporting or arguing. But since they are contrasting results, it's more CoCoRes than Neutral. 

Therefore, the primary is CoCoRes, secondary could be CoCoGM if there's a method comparison, but the example mentions results. The third might be Neutral as the base reference, but since the main intent is comparison of results, maybe Neutral isn't the best. Alternatively, maybe there's no other classes applicable here. 

Wait, the example given for CoCoRes is exactly like this case. So the top is definitely CoCoRes. Then perhaps Neutral if there's no further intent, but maybe there's nothing else. Wait, the options are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Motivation, Future, Support, Similar, Usage, Weakness, Neutral. 

In this case, the citation is used to compare results, so CoCoRes is 1. Then maybe Neutral if there's no other intent, but Neutral would be if it's just a neutral statement. However, the sentence is actively comparing results, so Neutral isn't the best fit. Maybe there's no other class applicable here, so the next could be CoCoXY if comparing explanations between two studies, but the example here is comparing the cited study's results with the current work's results, not between two cited studies. Therefore, CoCoRes is the only applicable here. But the task asks for top three, so perhaps the other two are Neutral or something else. Wait, maybe the citation is also serving as a basis for their comparison, but Basis is when it's foundational. Here, it's contrasting, not foundational. So Basis isn't applicable. 

Therefore, the top three would be CoCoRes, then maybe Neutral as the third if there's no other intent. Alternatively, maybe Weakness if they are pointing out a flaw, but the sentence just states a difference, not a weakness. So Weakness isn't right. 

So the final answer would be CoCoRes as first, Neutral as second if there's no other, but perhaps Neutral isn't the best. Maybe the third is nothing else, so maybe Neutral. Alternatively, maybe the third is none, but the instructions require three. Wait, perhaps the example in the task's CoCoRes example is the same as here, so CoCoRes is first. The third could be Neutral if the citation is just stating a fact without supporting, but in this case, the citation is part of a comparison, so Neutral isn't fitting. Maybe the third is CoCoGM if there's a method comparison, but the example here is about results. Hmm. 

Wait, the task requires three classes. Maybe CoCoRes is first, then CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two studies, but the example here is comparing current work with cited work. So CoCoXY is between two cited studies. Therefore, CoCoXY isn't applicable here. So maybe the second and third are Neutral or something else. But Neutral would be if the citation is just mentioned without any specific argument. Since the citation is used to contrast results, Neutral isn't the case. 

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The primary is CoCoRes. The second and third could be Neutral and maybe another. Wait, the example given in CoCoRes is exactly this scenario. So the top three would be CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral as the third. Wait, but Neutral is when the citation is neutral. Since the citation here is part of a comparison, Neutral isn't the right fit. Maybe there's no second and third classes applicable here, but the task requires three. Alternatively, maybe the third is CoCoGM if there's a method comparison. Wait, the example mentions "experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets" which could be a method difference. So maybe CoCoGM (Comparison of Goals or Methods) is also applicable here. Because they are comparing the methods (different targets used). 

Wait, the sentence says the current results differ from experiments using deuterium saturated metal targets. So the comparison is between the methods (different experimental setups). Therefore, CoCoGM could be applicable here as comparing methods. So maybe CoCoRes and CoCoGM are both applicable. 

In that case, the top three would be CoCoRes first (comparison of results), CoCoGM second (comparison of methods), and then maybe CoCoXY third if there's a comparison between two cited studies, but in this case, it's only one study. Therefore, CoCoXY isn't applicable. So the third could be Neutral. 

Wait, but Neutral is when the citation is neutral. Since the citation is part of a comparison, Neutral isn't correct. Maybe the third is nothing else. But the task requires three. Hmm. 

Alternatively, perhaps the primary is CoCoRes, secondary is CoCoGM (since methods are different), and third is Neutral. But Neutral might not be correct. Alternatively, maybe Weakness if the cited work's methods are being criticized, but the sentence doesn't criticize, just states a difference. 

So after reevaluating, the top three would be CoCoRes, CoCoGM, and Neutral. But Neutral might not be accurate here. Maybe CoCoRes is first, CoCoGM is second, and then maybe another class. Wait, the example given in CoCoGM is comparing goals or methods. Since the cited work used different metal targets, which is a method difference, CoCoGM is applicable. Therefore, CoCoRes and CoCoGM are both applicable. 

So the final answer would be:

1. CoCoRes
2. CoCoGM
3. Neutral

But Neutral might not be correct. Alternatively, maybe the third is nothing else, but the task requires three. Alternatively, maybe Weakness if the cited work's results are considered flawed, but the sentence just states a difference. 

Hmm, perhaps Neutral is the third if there's no other intent. Since the citation is part of a comparison, Neutral isn't correct. Maybe the third is nothing else, but the task requires three. Perhaps the third is Basis if the cited work is foundational, but here it's being compared, not foundational. 

I think I need to stick with CoCoRes and CoCoGM as the top two, and maybe Neutral as third if forced. But Neutral might not fit. Alternatively, maybe the third is nothing else, but the task requires three. Given the example provided in the task, maybe the answer is CoCoRes first, then CoCoGM second, and Neutral third. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the third is nothing else. 

Given the instructions, I'll proceed with CoCoRes as first, CoCoGM as second, and Neutral as third.
