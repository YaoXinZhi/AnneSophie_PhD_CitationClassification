Okay, let's start by looking at the citation marked @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. The context around it is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@."

First step is to extract the relevant context. The key part here is that the current work's results are stated to "substantially differ" from those of the cited experiments. This indicates a direct comparison between the results of the current study and the cited work.

Next, determining the general intent. The phrase "substantially differ" suggests that the authors are contrasting their findings with previous results. According to the definitions, this falls under Comparative intent, specifically CoCoRes since it's about comparing results.

Looking at the specific classes, CoCoRes is the most appropriate here because it's a direct comparison of results. There's no mention of goals or methods, so CoCoGM isn't relevant. The cited work isn't being used to support the current argument, so Support isn't applicable either. Neutral would be if there's just a factual mention without comparison, but here there's a clear contrast. Weakness isn't indicated here as there's no criticism of the cited work's limitations. Future or Motivation are not present either. 

So the top class is CoCoRes. For the second and third places, maybe Neutral if there's any neutral mention, but in this case, the context is purely about comparison. Basis isn't fitting here. The next possible could be Support if the cited work's results were being used to back up the current findings, but since it's a difference, Support isn't right. Maybe Neutral as the last resort, but the example given for Neutral is a factual statement without comparison. Since the example for CoCoRes is a direct comparison, this fits best. Therefore, CoCoRes is first. There's no other clear secondary class here, but perhaps Neutral if there's any other neutral context. However, the sentence is focused solely on contrasting results, so Neutral might not apply. Alternatively, maybe Similar isn't applicable because it's a difference, not a similarity. So the top three would be CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral as the next if there's any neutral part, but I'm not sure. Wait, the example for Neutral is a statement without any comparison, like stating a fact. Here, the comparison is explicit, so Neutral isn't the case. Maybe the next would be Basis if the cited work is foundational, but there's no indication of that. So perhaps CoCoRes is the only relevant one, but the task requires three classes. Hmm. Maybe Neutral is the third if there's any neutral mention elsewhere. But the context is only about the comparison. Wait, perhaps the rest of the sentence is neutral? Like mentioning the experiments conducted with deuterium targets. But the key part is the comparison. So maybe Neutral is part of the context but the main intent is CoCoRes. Since the task asks for three, maybe CoCoRes is first, then maybe Support if there's any support, but no. Alternatively, maybe the other classes aren't applicable. Perhaps Neutral is the third. Let me check the example again. Neutral example is "In the USA... @@CITATION@@", which is a factual statement without argument. Here, the statement is about differing results, which is a comparison. So Neutral isn't applicable. Therefore, the top three might be CoCoRes first, then maybe CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two cited works, but here it's between the current work and the cited work. So CoCoXY is not applicable. So maybe the top three are CoCoRes, then perhaps Basis if the cited work is foundational, but the example for Basis is about introducing a method. Here, it's about differing results. So Basis isn't right. Therefore, the only applicable is CoCoRes. But the task requires three classes. Maybe Neutral is the third as the rest of the sentence is neutral in describing the cited experiments. So maybe CoCoRes (1), Neutral (2), and then maybe Support as (3) if there's any support, but no. Alternatively, maybe CoCoRes is the only relevant one, but since the task asks for three, perhaps Neutral is forced as the third. But I'm not certain. Wait, maybe the context includes both the description of the cited experiments and the comparison. The part about the experiments is Neutral, and the comparison is CoCoRes. So Neutral would be part of the context. So the top three would be CoCoRes (1), Neutral (2), and then maybe Support or another class. But Support isn't there. Maybe Similar isn't applicable. So perhaps Neutral is second. Then the third could be Basis if the cited work is foundational, but no. Alternatively, maybe Weakness if the cited work's results are being questioned, but the example for Weakness is about taxonomic status being problematic. Here, the current work's results differ, not the cited work's being flawed. So Weakness isn't right. Therefore, the top three are CoCoRes, then Neutral, then maybe CoCoGM if there's any mention of goals or methods, but the example here is about results. So perhaps CoCoRes (1), Neutral (2), and then maybe CoCoGM as third. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe Neutral is not part of the context. Given the strict instructions, I'll go with CoCoRes as the primary, then Neutral if applicable, and perhaps Basis as third if forced. But I'm not confident. Given the example in CoCoRes matches the context, I'll stick with CoCoRes as first. The other two might not be applicable, but the task requires three. Maybe Neutral is the third. So the answer would be 1. CoCoRes, 2. Neutral, 3. Basis. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe CoCoRes is the only one, but the task requires three. Hmm. Maybe the user expects CoCoRes as first, then maybe CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two cited works, but here it's only one cited work compared to the current study. So CoCoXY isn't applicable. Therefore, the top three are CoCoRes (1), Neutral (2), and then maybe Support (3) if there's any support, but no. I'm stuck. Given the example provided in the task for CoCoRes matches the context, I'll proceed with CoCoRes as the first. For the second and third, perhaps Neutral and Basis, but I'm not sure. Maybe Neutral is not present here. Wait, the sentence says "the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@", which is a neutral description of the cited experiments. So Neutral would be part of the context. Therefore, the first is CoCoRes (comparison of results), second is Neutral (neutral description of cited experiments), third might be something else. But what? Maybe Basis if the cited work is foundational, but the example for Basis is introducing a method. Here, the cited work is providing results to compare. So Basis isn't right. Therefore, the top three would be CoCoRes, Neutral, and maybe another class. But I can't think of another applicable class. Maybe Weakness isn't applicable here. So the answer would be CoCoRes (1), Neutral (2), and then perhaps CoCoGM (3) even though it's not about goals or methods. Alternatively, maybe Basis. Hmm. Given the ambiguity, I'll proceed with CoCoRes as first, Neutral as second, and then Basis as third, even though it's a stretch.
