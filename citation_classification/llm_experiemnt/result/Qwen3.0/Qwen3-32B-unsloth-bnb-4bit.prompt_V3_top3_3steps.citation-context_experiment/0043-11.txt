Okay, let's start by looking at the citation passage provided. The sentence around the citation mentions that the authors observed a significant increase in disease symptoms when plants were infected with a specific strain, similar to the findings reported by the cited work. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The key part here is the phrase "similar to the findings of @@CITATION@@", which indicates that the current study's results are comparable to those in the cited paper.

Next, determining the general intent. Since the authors are pointing out a similarity between their results and the cited work, this falls under the Supportive category. The citation is being used to back up their own findings by referencing a previous study that observed similar outcomes. 

Now, narrowing down to the specific rhetorical classes. The primary class here would be "Similar" because they're highlighting a similarity in results. Then, considering secondary classes, "Support" might also apply since they're using the citation to support their own findings. However, since "Similar" is more directly about pointing out resemblance, it should rank higher. 

The third class could be "Neutral" if the citation is just being used descriptively, but since there's an explicit mention of similarity, Neutral might not be the best fit. Alternatively, "CoCoRes" could be considered if comparing results, but the example for "Similar" specifically involves pointing out similarities between the cited work and the current study. Therefore, "Similar" is more appropriate than CoCoRes here. 

So the top three classes would be Similar, Support, and maybe Neutral as a third if there's no stronger category. But given the context, Neutral isn't the best fit. Perhaps "Support" is the second, and maybe "Basis" isn't applicable here since it's not foundational. "CoCoRes" is about comparing results between the citing paper and the cited work, which is similar to "Similar", but the example given for "Similar" is more about results similarity. So the ranking would be Similar first, Support second, and CoCoRes third if needed, but maybe Neutral is third if there's no other. Wait, the example for Neutral is more about stating a fact without argument. In this case, since the citation is used to support similarity, Neutral isn't fitting. Therefore, the top three are Similar, Support, and maybe CoCoRes if the comparison is between the two studies. But the example for Similar says pointing out similarity between cited work and citing paper. So CoCoRes is when comparing results of cited work with the current paper's results. In the example given for CoCoRes, they mention "substantially differ from the results of the experiments", so if the current study's results are similar, then CoCoRes might not be the right category. Wait, the example for Similar is "Our finding... is supported by... in fleas and ticks...", which is similar. So maybe CoCoRes is when comparing results between the citing paper and the cited work, but if it's a similarity, then Similar is better. Therefore, the top three are Similar, Support, and perhaps Neutral as third if there's no other. Wait, maybe CoCoRes isn't applicable here because it's a similarity rather than a comparison of results. So the correct classes would be Similar first, Support second, and maybe Neutral third if applicable. But in the given context, the citation is used to support their finding by showing similarity, so Support would be appropriate as second. Neutral might not be right unless it's purely descriptive. The example for Neutral is "In the USA...", which is just stating a fact. Here, the citation is used to support similarity, so Neutral isn't the case. Therefore, the top three classes are Similar, Support, and maybe CoCoRes. Wait, maybe the example for CoCoRes is a direct comparison, but here it's a similarity. Hmm. Let me recheck the definitions.

- Similar: point out similarity between cited work and citing paper.
- Support: support the work, result, or finding of the citing authors.

In the example for Similar, they mention their finding is supported by previous research, pointing out similarity. So Similar is the primary class here. Support could be secondary if they're using the citation to confirm their findings. Neutral isn't applicable here. So the top three would be Similar, Support, and maybe CoCoRes if there's a result comparison. But since the example for Similar includes supporting their finding with similarity, Support might be redundant. Alternatively, maybe Support is not needed here. Wait, the example for Support is "All subscales were consistent with previous research...", which is similar to the current case. So in this case, the citation is used to support their findings by showing similarity. Therefore, the primary class is Support, and Similar is secondary. Wait, but the example for Similar is "Our finding... is supported by...", which combines both Support and Similar. Hmm, perhaps the primary class is Support, and Similar is secondary. Alternatively, maybe Similar is the primary. Let me check the definitions again.

Support: the citation is used to support, confirm the work, result, or finding of the citing authors.

Similar: the citation is used to point out a similarity between cited work and citing paper.

In the given context, the authors are saying their results are similar to those in the cited work, which supports their own findings. So both Support and Similar are applicable. Which is more primary? The example for Similar uses "supported by" but also mentions similarity. Maybe in this case, both are correct, but according to the definitions, Similar is pointing out similarity, while Support is confirming their findings. So perhaps Similar is the primary, and Support is secondary. Alternatively, maybe they are both applicable. Since the task is to select the top three, perhaps Similar is first, Support is second, and Neutral is third if needed. But Neutral isn't applicable here. Maybe CoCoRes is third if there's a comparison of results. Wait, the example for CoCoRes is a direct comparison of results between the citing paper and the cited work. In this case, the authors are comparing their results to the cited work's results by stating similarity, so CoCoRes might be appropriate as a third class. But the example for Similar is about similarity, which is a type of result comparison. Hmm. Maybe CoCoRes is when there's a direct comparison (either similar or different), while Similar is a subset of CoCoRes. But according to the definitions, CoCoRes is a direct comparison, and Similar is a similarity. So perhaps Similar is more specific than CoCoRes. Therefore, Similar would be first, CoCoRes second, and Support third? Wait, the example for Support is about consistency with previous research, which is similar to the current case. So Support is also applicable. This is a bit tricky. Given the example provided for Similar, where they mention similarity and support, perhaps Similar is the primary class, Support is secondary, and Neutral is third if applicable. But Neutral isn't fitting here. Alternatively, maybe CoCoRes is third. But I think the best approach is to follow the definitions strictly. The citation is used to point out similarity (Similar) and support their findings (Support). Neutral isn't applicable here. So the top three are Similar, Support, and maybe CoCoRes as third if there's a result comparison. However, since Similar is about similarity, which is a type of result comparison, maybe CoCoRes isn't needed. Therefore, the final top three would be Similar, Support, and Neutral. But Neutral doesn't fit here. Hmm, perhaps Neutral is not the right third class. Maybe there's no third class applicable beyond Similar and Support. But the task requires three classes. Maybe the third is Neutral. Alternatively, maybe the third is Basis, but that's not the case here. Alternatively, maybe Weakness or Future, but that's not applicable. Given the ambiguity, perhaps the correct ranking is Similar, Support, Neutral. But Neutral is not fitting. Maybe the third is CoCoRes. Let me check again. The example for CoCoRes is "substantially differ from...", which is a comparison of results. In the current case, the authors are stating similarity, which is a type of result comparison, so CoCoRes would be applicable as a third class. Therefore, the top three are Similar, Support, CoCoRes. But wait, the example for Similar includes "supported by...", which is Support. So maybe Similar and Support are both applicable. The task requires three classes, so perhaps the top three are Similar, Support, CoCoRes. Alternatively, maybe Similar is first, CoCoRes is second, Support is third. But according to the example, Support is when the citation is used to support the current findings. In the given context, the citation supports the current findings by showing similarity, so Support is applicable. Therefore, the top three would be Similar, Support, CoCoRes. But I'm not entirely sure. Given the definitions, I think the correct classes are Similar, Support, and CoCoRes.
