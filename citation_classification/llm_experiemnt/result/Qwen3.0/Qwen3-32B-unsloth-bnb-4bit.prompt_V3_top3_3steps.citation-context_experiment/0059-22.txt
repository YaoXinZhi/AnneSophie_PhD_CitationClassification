Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation marked in the passage. First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The sentence is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@."

So the key part here is comparing the present results with those from another study. The phrase "substantially differ" indicates a direct comparison of results. According to the definitions, CoCoRes is when the citation is used to compare or contrast results. That seems like the primary class here.

Next, is there a secondary class? The example given for CoCoRes is similar to this case. The citation is contrasting their findings with previous experiments. There's no mention of comparing explanations or methods here, so CoCoGM or CoCoXY might not apply. The context is straightforwardly about results. 

What about Neutral? Neutral is when the citation is used descriptively without supporting or comparing. But here, the citation is actively contrasting results, so Neutral is probably not the main class. 

Looking at other options like Support or Similar, but the passage says "differ," which is the opposite of Similar. Support would be if they're confirming findings, which isn't the case here. 

Could there be a Basis? Basis is foundational, but this is about comparing results, not establishing a foundation. 

So the top class is CoCoRes. Then maybe CoCoXY? Wait, CoCoXY is comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies. In the example given, CoCoXY contrasts two studies with each other, not with the current paper. Here, the current paper is contrasting with another study, so it's CoCoRes. 

Is there a secondary class? Maybe Neutral? If the citation is just stating the existence of another study's results, but the main intent here is to compare. So Neutral might be secondary. 

Wait, the example under CoCoRes says the citation is used to compare results. So the primary is CoCoRes. The secondary could be Neutral if the citation is also being mentioned descriptively. But the example given for Neutral is more like a factual statement without comparison. In this case, the comparison is the main intent, so Neutral might not be appropriate. 

Alternatively, maybe there's no second class. But the task says to pick top three. Let me check the definitions again. 

The task says to rank the top three specific classes. The primary is CoCoRes. Then maybe CoCoGM if there's a method comparison, but the context here is about results. The passage mentions "results of the experiments," so maybe CoCoRes is the only relevant one. But the instructions require three classes. Hmm. 

Wait, maybe CoCoRes is the primary. Then perhaps Neutral as secondary if the citation is also being used to reference the study's existence. Or maybe Weakness if the other study's results are being criticized. But the sentence says "substantially differ," not that the cited study is flawed. So Weakness might not apply. 

Looking at the example for CoCoRes again: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted... @@CITATION@." That's exactly the example given in the CoCoRes definition. So the primary class is CoCoRes. 

Then, what's the second and third? Since the example doesn't mention other classes, maybe Neutral is secondary. The citation is being used to reference another study's results, which is descriptive. But Neutral is when the citation is used neutrally without comparison. Wait, but in this case, the citation is part of a comparison. So Neutral might not be appropriate. 

Alternatively, maybe there's no second class, but the task requires three. Maybe CoCoRes is the primary, then maybe CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two cited studies. But the example here is comparing current results with a cited study, not two cited studies. So CoCoXY is not applicable. 

Wait, the instruction says to rank the top three from the list. Maybe CoCoRes is first, then Neutral as second, and then maybe Basis as third? But why Basis? The cited study isn't foundational here. 

Hmm. Maybe the answer is CoCoRes, then Neutral, then maybe CoCoGM. But I'm not sure. The example given in CoCoRes is straightforward. Maybe the top three are CoCoRes, Neutral, and then maybe CoCoXY. But I'm not certain. 

Alternatively, perhaps CoCoRes is the only relevant class, but the task requires three. Maybe I'm missing something. Wait, the example under CoCoRes is exactly this scenario. So maybe the top three are CoCoRes, Neutral, and then maybe CoCoGM. But I need to think again. 

Wait, maybe the citation is used to contrast results, which is CoCoRes. Then, perhaps Neutral is if the citation is just stating the existence of the study. But the main intent is the comparison. Maybe Neutral is not applicable here. 

Alternatively, perhaps the citation is being used to support the claim that there are differing results, but Support would be if it's confirming something. 

Hmm. Given the example provided for CoCoRes matches the given passage exactly, the primary class is CoCoRes. For the second and third, perhaps Neutral and then maybe CoCoXY. But I'm not sure. Wait, maybe Neutral isn't applicable here. 

Alternatively, maybe the second class is CoCoGM if the methods are compared. But the passage mentions "results," not methods. 

So maybe CoCoRes is first, then maybe Neutral as the second, and then maybe CoCoXY as third. But I'm not confident. However, given the example, CoCoRes is definitely first. The other two might be Neutral and CoCoXY, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe there's no other classes applicable. 

Wait, the task says to pick the top three, but maybe in some cases, only one is clear. However, the instructions require three. Given that, perhaps the top three are CoCoRes, Neutral, and then maybe CoCoGM. But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is CoCoRes, then Neutral, then Basis. But again, not sure. 

Given the example matches exactly CoCoRes, perhaps the top three are CoCoRes, Neutral, CoCoXY. But I'm not certain. Maybe the correct answer is CoCoRes, Neutral, and then maybe CoCoGM. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is CoCoRes, Neutral, and then Basis. 

But I think based on the example provided, CoCoRes is definitely the primary class. The other two might be Neutral and CoCoXY. But I'm not sure. 

Wait, looking back at the example given for Neutral: "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@." That's a neutral statement. In the given passage, the citation is part of a comparison of results, so Neutral doesn't apply here. Therefore, Neutral isn't appropriate. 

So perhaps the top three are CoCoRes, CoCoGM, and then maybe CoCoXY. But the passage is comparing results, not goals or methods. 

Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is CoCoRes, then maybe CoCoXY if comparing two cited studies. But in the given passage, it's comparing current results with cited results. So CoCoXY is not applicable. 

Therefore, the top three classes are CoCoRes, then perhaps Neutral (if applicable), and maybe CoCoGM. But Neutral isn't applicable here. 

Wait, maybe the correct answer is CoCoRes, then maybe Basis and then Neutral. But why Basis? 

This is tricky. Given the example matches CoCoRes exactly, I'll go with CoCoRes as the primary. Then maybe Neutral isn't applicable, but the task requires three. Perhaps the answer is CoCoRes, then Neutral, then CoCoGM. But I'm not confident. 

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is CoCoRes, then maybe CoCoXY, then Neutral. But again, not sure. 

Wait, maybe the citation is used to compare results, so CoCoRes is first. Then, since the citation is mentioned in the context of contrasting results, perhaps there's a comparison of explanations (CoCoXY) if two studies are compared. But in the given passage, it's the current study vs. the cited study. So CoCoXY is not applicable. 

Therefore, the top three are CoCoRes, then maybe Neutral, then maybe CoCoGM. But Neutral doesn't fit here. 

Given the example provided matches CoCoRes exactly, the correct answer is CoCoRes as the primary class. The other two might be Neutral and CoCoGM, but I'm not certain. 

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is CoCoRes, then maybe Weakness if the cited study's results are considered flawed. But the passage says the results differ, not that they're flawed. 

Hmm. I think I need to stick with CoCoRes as the primary class. For the second and third, perhaps Neutral and CoCoXY. But since Neutral isn't applicable, maybe CoCoRes is the only one. However, the task requires three. 

Wait, maybe the correct answer is CoCoRes, then CoCoGM, then Neutral. But why CoCoGM? Because maybe the methods are compared implicitly. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is CoCoRes, then CoCoXY, then Neutral. But again, not sure. 

Given the example provided matches CoCoRes exactly, I'll proceed with CoCoRes as the primary class. The other two might be Neutral and CoCoXY, but I'm not confident. 

After careful consideration, the top three classes are CoCoRes, then perhaps Neutral and CoCoXY. But given the example, CoCoRes is the only clear one. However, the task requires three, so maybe CoCoRes, then Neutral, then CoCoGM.
