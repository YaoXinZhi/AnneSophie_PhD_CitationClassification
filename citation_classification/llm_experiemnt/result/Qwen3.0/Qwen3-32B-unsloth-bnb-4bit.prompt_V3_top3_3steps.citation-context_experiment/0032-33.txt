Okay, let me try to figure this out. The task is to classify the rhetorical class of the given citation in the passage. First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the authors used a specific method, which was previously described by @@CITATION@@. The example given in the Usage class says that the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup used directly in the current study. 

So, in this case, the citation is about the experimental setup being described previously. That seems like the Usage class because they're directly using the setup from the cited work. 

Next, I need to check if there's any other possible classes. The general intent here is technical, as they're referring to a method they used. The Usage class is for technical references. Are there any comparisons or support here? The passage doesn't compare methods or results with the cited work; it just states that the setup was described before. So Support or Similar might not fit. 

Looking at the example for Usage again: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@." That's exactly what the passage is doing. So Usage is definitely the top class. 

Are there any other classes? Maybe Neutral? But Neutral is for when the citation is used descriptively without supporting or comparing. Here, the citation is providing a reference for the method used, which is more technical, so Usage is more specific than Neutral. 

So the top three would be Usage first, then maybe Basis if they're building on that method as a foundation, but the example for Basis is about introducing a concept. Since the citation here is about the setup they used, Usage is more accurate. Then perhaps Support or Similar? The passage doesn't support their findings with the citation, just the method. So maybe Neutral as the second, but I think Usage is the only strong one here. Wait, the example for Support says "support, confirm the work, result or finding," but here it's about the method. So Usage is correct. 

Therefore, the top three should be Usage first, then maybe Neutral or Basis as secondary. But looking at the definitions again, Basis is foundational. If the cited work is the foundation for their current method, maybe Basis could be a secondary class. However, the example for Basis is about introducing a concept. Since the citation here is directly about using a setup, Usage is more precise. 

So the final ranking would be 1. Usage, then maybe Neutral as second if there's no other. Wait, the example for Neutral is about descriptive use. Since the citation is descriptive here but refers to a method, Usage is more specific. So Neutral might not be appropriate. Maybe there's no second class. But the task requires three. Hmm. Maybe CoCoGM if they're comparing methods, but the passage doesn't compare, it just refers to using the setup. So perhaps Usage is the only one, but the task requires three. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me recheck the passage.

The passage says, "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@." So the citation is used to reference the method they used. That's definitely Usage. Are there any other possible classes? Maybe Support if they're supporting their method by citing that it was previously described. But Support is for supporting results or findings, not methods. Usage is for methods, tools, etc. So Usage is first. Then maybe Basis if the cited work is the foundation. But Basis is when the citation introduces the foundation of the research. If the experimental setup is foundational, maybe Basis is secondary. However, the example for Basis is about introducing a concept. Since the citation here is about the setup they used, which is part of their methodology, maybe CoCoGM if they're comparing goals or methods. But they're not comparing; they're just citing the setup. So perhaps Usage is the only one. Wait, the task requires three classes. Maybe Neutral is third. Since the citation is used in a descriptive way. But Neutral is when there's no support, compare, etc. Since they are using the setup, it's not Neutral. Hmm. Maybe the top three are Usage, then maybe Basis, then Neutral. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe Usage is first, then Support as second if they support their method by citing it. But Support is for results. So perhaps Neutral is third. Let me go with the example given. The example for Usage is about the experimental setup being described previously. So Usage is definitely first. Then maybe Neutral if there's no other. But the task says to pick three. Maybe CoCoXY or something else. Alternatively, maybe there's no other classes. Wait, the example for Neutral is "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@." That's a descriptive citation. In our case, the citation is about the setup being used, so maybe Usage is first, then Neutral if it's also descriptive. But the example for Neutral is a general fact, whereas Usage is about a method. So perhaps Usage is first, then maybe Basis if the setup is foundational. But I'm not certain. Maybe the correct answer is Usage, then Neutral, then maybe Basis. But I'm not sure. Given the strict definitions, Usage is the top. The second could be Support if they're supporting their method by citing, but Support is for results. Neutral might be third. So I'll go with 1. Usage, 2. Neutral, 3. Basis. But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, maybe only Usage is correct, and the others are not applicable. But the task requires three. Hmm. Maybe I need to look again. The example for Support says "support, or confirm the work, result or finding." Here, the citation is about the method, not results. So Support doesn't fit. CoCoGM would be if they compared goals or methods, which they don't. So maybe the only correct is Usage. But the task requires three. Maybe Neutral is third. So final answer: 1. Usage, 2. Neutral, 3. Basis.
