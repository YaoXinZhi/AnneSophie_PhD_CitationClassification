Okay, let's tackle this classification task step by step. First, I need to look at the citation marked @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. The context around it is crucial. Let me read through the passage again to get the surrounding sentences.

The passage says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@."

So the key part here is that the current study's results are being compared as substantially different from those in the cited work. The example given for CoCoRes is similar: comparing results between the current work and the cited paper. The example mentions differences in results, which matches the context here. 

Next, I need to determine the general intent. Since the citation is highlighting a difference in results, this falls under Comparative â†’ CoCoRes. There's no mention of contrasting goals or methods here, so CoCoGM isn't likely. Also, there's no comparison between two cited studies without involving the citing paper, so CoCoXY isn't applicable. 

Looking at the other classes: Motivation, Future, Support, Similar, Usage, Weakness, Neutral. The passage isn't motivating the research, suggesting future work, supporting the current findings, pointing out similarities, using a method, criticizing, or being neutral. The primary intent is to compare results directly. 

Are there any other possible classes? Maybe Neutral? But the example given for Neutral is more descriptive without a specific argument. Here, the comparison is direct and relevant to the findings, so Neutral isn't the best fit. 

So the top class is definitely CoCoRes. For the second and third places, maybe CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two cited works, but in this case, the comparison is between the current work and the cited one. So CoCoRes is first. 

What about Basis? The example for Basis is about foundational work, which isn't the case here. Support would be if they're confirming their results with the cited work, but here it's a difference. Weakness would imply criticism, which isn't present. 

Therefore, the top three classes are CoCoRes first, then maybe CoCoGM if there's any mention of methods or goals, but the example here doesn't indicate that. Wait, the cited work's experiments used different targets (deuterium saturated metal targets), so maybe there's a comparison of methods? The current work's methods might differ in the targets used. However, the context mentions the results differ, not the methods. The example for CoCoRes is about results, so CoCoRes is still the primary class here. 

If there's no further comparison beyond results, then the second and third classes might be Neutral or something else. But since the example given for CoCoRes is a direct comparison of results, that's the main one. Neutral would be if it's just a descriptive citation without argument. However, the context here is a direct comparison, so Neutral isn't the best fit. 

Therefore, the top three are CoCoRes, then maybe Basis if the cited work is foundational, but the example here is about differing results. Wait, Basis is when the citation is the foundation of the current research. Here, the cited work is being contrasted, so Basis isn't correct. 

I think the only relevant class here is CoCoRes. However, the instructions ask for top three. Since the citation is directly comparing results, CoCoRes is first. If there's no other clear classes, perhaps Neutral as a fallback? But the example for Neutral is more about stating facts without argument. In this case, the citation is used to highlight a difference, which is a direct comparison, so Neutral isn't right. 

Maybe CoCoXY? The example for CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies with each other, not involving the current paper. Here, the comparison is between current work and the cited one, so CoCoXY isn't applicable. 

So the top three are CoCoRes, then perhaps Neutral as the least appropriate, but I'm not sure. Wait, the instructions require three classes ranked from most to least appropriate. If CoCoRes is the primary, then maybe CoCoGM or CoCoXY as secondary? But there's no evidence for those here. 

Alternatively, maybe Neutral is third. But why? If the citation is only used for comparison of results, then Neutral isn't applicable. Perhaps the third is Neutral, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe Weakness if the cited work's results are being criticized. But the passage states the results "substantially differ," which isn't necessarily a criticism. 

Hmm. Given the strict definitions, the most accurate is CoCoRes first. Since the task requires three, perhaps Neutral is third. Wait, the example for Neutral is descriptive, like stating a fact. Here, the citation is part of a comparative statement, so Neutral isn't appropriate. 

I'm a bit stuck on the second and third classes. Maybe the citation is primarily CoCoRes, and then maybe Basis or Support as secondary? But there's no indication of foundational work or support. 

Given the example provided in the task, the correct answer would be CoCoRes first. The other two might be CoCoXY and Neutral based on the example given, but the context here doesn't involve comparing two cited works. 

Wait, looking back at the example for CoCoRes: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." That's exactly matching the example given for CoCoRes. So the top class is definitely CoCoRes. 

The second and third classes might be Neutral or something else, but since the citation is used in a comparative context, Neutral isn't fitting. Maybe there's no other classes applicable. Perhaps the top three are CoCoRes, then maybe CoCoGM and then Neutral. But without any evidence of method or goal comparison, CoCoGM isn't applicable. 

Therefore, the final answer is CoCoRes as the first, then perhaps Neutral as the second and third, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the task expects only CoCoRes and the other two are less relevant. Wait, the task says to output exactly three rhetorical classes. Given the example, the correct answer is CoCoRes first. The other two might be CoCoXY and Neutral, but based on the context, CoCoXY isn't applicable. 

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is CoCoRes, then maybe CoCoGM and Neutral as the next two, even if they aren't strongly indicated. Alternatively, maybe the task expects CoCoRes first and then Neutral and Basis as the others. But Basis isn't indicated here. 

I think the best approach is to stick with CoCoRes as the primary class, and since the task requires three, perhaps Neutral and CoCoGM as the others, even if they aren't strongly present. But given the strict definitions, I think the answer is CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral and then something else. However, without further evidence, I'll proceed with CoCoRes as the top class and perhaps Neutral as the third, even if it's not perfect.
