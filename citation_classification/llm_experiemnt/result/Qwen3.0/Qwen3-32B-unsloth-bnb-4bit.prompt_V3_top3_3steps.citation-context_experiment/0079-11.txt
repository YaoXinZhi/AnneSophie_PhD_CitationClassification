Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the current study uses a method developed by @@CITATION@@. The key part here is that they're using the method directly. 

Next, identifying the general intent. Since the citation is about a method being used in the current research, this falls under the Technical category. The specific class here would be Usage because the authors are referring to a method from the cited work that they're applying in their own study.

Looking at the examples provided for Usage, it matches when a method or tool is directly used. The example given is about an experimental setup described in a previous study. In this case, the method from @@CITATION@@ is being utilized, so Usage is the primary class.

For the secondary classes, maybe there's a Basis aspect if the method is foundational, but the example for Basis talks about introducing and validating something, which isn't the case here. The citation isn't comparing results or methods either. The main intent is straightforward usage without any comparison or support. So the top three would be Usage, then maybe Neutral if there's no other intent, but the example for Neutral is more about stating a fact without any argument. Since the citation here is directly about using a method, Usage is first. The next could be Support if they're confirming something, but the example for Support is about consistency with previous results, which isn't the case here. Alternatively, Basis might be considered if the method is foundational, but again, the example for Basis is about introducing a concept. Since the primary is Usage, the next two might be Neutral or Basis, but I think Usage is the only strong one here. Wait, the example for Usage is direct, so maybe Usage is first, then Neutral if there's no other intent. But maybe there's another. Let me check again. The citation is used to reference the method they're using, so Usage is the main. The next could be Basis if the method is the foundation, but the example for Basis is about introducing a concept. If the method is the foundation, then Basis might come next. Alternatively, if the citation is just stating they used a method without it being foundational, maybe Neutral. Hmm. The example for Neutral is stating a fact without supporting or arguing. Since the citation here is about using a method, which is technical, Usage is first. The next could be Basis if the method is the foundation. If the cited work's method is the basis for the current study, then Basis would be second. Otherwise, maybe Neutral. But the example for Basis mentions validation, which might not apply here. The passage here just says they used the method, not that it's the foundation. So perhaps Usage is first, then maybe Neutral, and then maybe Support if they're supporting their approach by citing the method. But Support is about confirming results. I think Usage is the primary, then maybe Neutral as the second if there's no other intent. Wait, the example for Neutral is a descriptive use without supporting anything. Since the citation here is about using a method, which is technical, Usage is first. The next could be Basis if the method is foundational, but if it's just a tool they're using, maybe Neutral. I'm a bit torn here. Let's stick with Usage as first, then maybe Neutral as second, and then Basis as third if applicable. But I need to be precise based on the examples given.

1. Usage  
2. Neutral  
3. Basis
