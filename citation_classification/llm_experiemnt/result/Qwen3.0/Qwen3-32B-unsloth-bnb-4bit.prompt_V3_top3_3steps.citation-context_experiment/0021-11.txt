Okay, let's start by looking at the citation in question. The sentence around the citation says, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." 

So the context here is about comparing the current study's results with those from another experiment that used different metal targets. The key word here is "substantially differ," which indicates a direct comparison of results.

Now, looking at the rhetorical classes, CoCoRes is specifically for comparing or contrasting results of cited work with the citing paper. That fits perfectly here because the sentence is directly contrasting the results. 

Next, Basis might be a stretch here because the citation isn't establishing a foundational reference but rather is pointing out differences. Similarly, Support doesn't fit because it's not supporting the current work but contrasting it. 

CoCoXY is about comparing two cited studies with each other, not with the current work, so that's not applicable here. 

Motivation, Future, Usage, Weakness, Neutral also don't fit because the context is about result differences. 

So the top three would be CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral if there's any neutral mention, but the sentence is clearly contrasting results, so Neutral might not be right. Wait, maybe the second could be Basis if the cited work is foundational, but the example given for CoCoRes is almost identical. So CoCoRes is definitely first. 

The next possible classes might be CoCoGM if there's a method comparison, but the sentence is about results. The example for CoCoRes is similar to this case. 

So the top three are CoCoRes, then maybe Neutral or Basis, but Neutral is when the citation is descriptive without supporting or comparing. Since the sentence is contrasting results, CoCoRes is first. The next could be CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two cited studies, but here it's between current work and cited work. So maybe Neutral is third if there's no further intent beyond CoCoRes. Wait, the example for Neutral is a descriptive citation without any argument. In this case, the citation is used to contrast results, so Neutral isn't appropriate here. 

Wait, the example for CoCoRes is about differing results from experiments conducted with certain targets. So CoCoRes is definitely first. The next could be CoCoGM if there's a method comparison, but the sentence mentions results. Maybe Basis is third if the cited work is foundational, but the example for Basis is about introducing a method. 

Alternatively, maybe the second is Neutral if the citation is just stating a fact. But Neutral examples don't involve comparison. So perhaps the top three are CoCoRes, then maybe Basis if the cited work is foundational, but the context here is about results difference. 

Hmm, maybe the second is CoCoXY if the citation is comparing two studies. Wait, the example for CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies with each other, not the current work. So in this case, the citation is comparing current results with cited results, so CoCoRes is first. The next possible could be CoCoGM if the methods are compared, but the sentence doesn't mention methods. So maybe Neutral is third if there's no further intent. But Neutral isn't really fitting here. 

Wait, maybe the second is CoCoXY if the cited study is being compared with another study, but the example given here is only comparing current work with cited work. So perhaps the top three are CoCoRes, then maybe Basis or Support. Wait, Support is when the citation supports the current work. Here, it's contrasting, so Support isn't right. 

So the top three would be CoCoRes, then maybe CoCoGM if there's a method comparison, but the sentence is about results. Therefore, CoCoRes is first, then maybe Neutral, but Neutral isn't appropriate. Alternatively, maybe the second is Basis if the cited work is foundational. 

Wait, the example for Basis is about introducing and validating a method. In this case, the cited work's results are being compared, not introducing a method. So Basis isn't right. 

So the top three are CoCoRes first. The second could be CoCoXY if comparing two cited studies, but the example here is comparing current work with cited work. Therefore, CoCoRes is first, then maybe Neutral as third, but Neutral isn't fitting. Hmm, perhaps the second is Basis, but I don't see that here. 

Alternatively, maybe the second is CoCoRes again, but that's not possible. Wait, maybe the third is Neutral. Wait, Neutral is when the citation is used descriptively without any argument. Since the sentence is contrasting results, Neutral isn't applicable. So perhaps the top three are CoCoRes, then maybe CoCoGM if there's a method comparison, but the sentence mentions results. 

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The example given for CoCoRes matches the context here. So CoCoRes is first. The next possible classes might be CoCoXY or CoCoGM, but since the comparison is between current and cited results, CoCoRes is the only one applicable. So the top three are CoCoRes, then maybe Neutral or Basis. But neither fits. 

Wait, maybe the second is CoCoGM if the methods are different. The cited work used deuterium saturated metal targets, and the current work's methods might be different, leading to different results. So CoCoGM could be second if comparing methods. The sentence says "results obtained... differ from experiments conducted with..." which implies different methods (using different targets). So CoCoGM would be comparing methods. 

Therefore, CoCoRes (comparison of results) is first, CoCoGM (comparison of methods) is second, and maybe Basis is third if the cited work is foundational, but the example doesn't indicate that. 

Alternatively, maybe Neutral is third if there's no further intent. But since the citation is used to contrast results, Neutral isn't right. 

So the top three are CoCoRes, CoCoGM, and maybe Basis. But Basis is about foundational work. 

Hmm, perhaps the correct top three are CoCoRes, CoCoGM, and then Neutral. But Neutral doesn't fit here. 

Wait, maybe the third is CoCoXY if comparing two cited studies. But the example here is comparing current work with cited work. 

I think the best answer here is CoCoRes first, CoCoGM second, and then maybe Neutral third, but Neutral isn't correct. Alternatively, maybe the third is Basis. But Basis is about foundational work. 

Given the example in the problem, the correct top three should be CoCoRes first, then maybe CoCoGM if methods are compared, and then Neutral if there's any neutral mention. But I'm not sure. 

Wait, the example given for CoCoRes is almost identical to the problem's context. So CoCoRes is definitely first. The second could be CoCoGM if methods are compared. Since the cited work used different targets (methods), CoCoGM would be comparing methods. So CoCoGM is second. The third could be Basis if the cited work is foundational, but the example doesn't indicate that. 

Alternatively, maybe the third is Neutral, but Neutral isn't fitting here. 

So the top three are CoCoRes, CoCoGM, and then maybe Neutral. But Neutral isn't right. 

Hmm, perhaps the third is CoCoXY if comparing two cited studies, but the problem's context is comparing current work with cited work. 

I think the correct answer is CoCoRes first, CoCoGM second, and then maybe Basis third. But Basis is about foundational work. 

Alternatively, maybe the third is Neutral. But Neutral isn't appropriate here. 

Given the example, the correct top three are CoCoRes, CoCoGM, and then Neutral. But Neutral isn't right. 

Wait, maybe the third is CoCoXY. Wait, CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies. If the citation is comparing two studies, but in the problem's context, it's comparing current work with cited work. So CoCoXY isn't right. 

Therefore, the top three are CoCoRes, CoCoGM, and then maybe Basis. But Basis is about foundational work. 

I'm a bit stuck, but based on the example given in the problem, the correct top three should be CoCoRes first, then CoCoGM second, and then Neutral third. But Neutral isn't fitting. 

Wait, maybe the third is Weakness if the cited work's results are being criticized. But the problem's context says the results "substantially differ," which is a contrast, not criticism. 

Hmm, perhaps the third is Support. But Support is when the citation supports the current work. 

Alternatively, maybe the third is Neutral. 

Given the example provided, the correct answer is CoCoRes first, then maybe CoCoGM second, and then Neutral third. But Neutral doesn't fit. 

Wait, maybe the third is CoCoXY. 

No, CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies. 

I think the correct answer is CoCoRes first, CoCoGM second, and then Neutral third. Even though Neutral isn't perfectly fitting, perhaps that's the best possible given the options. 

But I'm not sure. Maybe the third is Basis. 

Alternatively, maybe the third is Weakness. 

Wait, Weakness is when the cited work is criticized. The problem's context says the results differ substantially, which might indicate a limitation or weakness in the cited work's results. So Weakness could be third. 

So the top three would be CoCoRes, CoCoGM, Weakness. 

But the example for Weakness is about taxonomic status being problematic. In the problem's context, the results differ, which might indicate that the cited work's results are not reliable, hence Weakness. 

So maybe the top three are CoCoRes, CoCoGM, Weakness. 

But the example for Weakness is about questioning the cited work. The problem's context is contrasting results, which could imply that the cited work's results are not valid, hence Weakness. 

Therefore, the top three are CoCoRes, CoCoGM, Weakness.
