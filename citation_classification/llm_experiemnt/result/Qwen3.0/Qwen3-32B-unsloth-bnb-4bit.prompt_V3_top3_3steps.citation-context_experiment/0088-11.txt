Okay, let me try to work through this step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the citation marked @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. The passage says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." 

So the context is that the current study's results differ from those of a previous experiment using specific deuterium targets cited here. The main point is comparing their results with the cited work's results.

Next, identifying the general intent. The phrase "substantially differ" suggests a direct comparison between the findings of the two studies. According to the definitions, this falls under Comparative intent. In the step-by-step guide, Comparative maps to CoCoRes (Comparison of Results) when directly contrasting results. 

Looking at the examples provided, CoCoRes is used when comparing results of cited work with the current paper. The example given is similar: "The results obtained... differ... @@CITATION@@", which matches our case. 

Now, checking if there are other possible classes. The passage doesn't mention goals or methods, so CoCoGM is out. It's a direct comparison of results, so CoCoRes is primary. Neutral would be if it's just descriptive without comparison, but here it's a clear contrast. Support isn't applicable since it's not supporting the current findings. Basis is foundational, which isn't the case here. Motivation or Future aren't indicated. Weakness would be if criticizing the cited work, but it's a neutral comparison. 

So the top three would be CoCoRes first. Then maybe Neutral if there's any descriptive aspect, but since it's a comparison, Neutral might not be second. Wait, the example for CoCoRes is similar to the given context. The third could be CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two cited studies, but in this case, it's comparing cited work with the current study's results. So CoCoRes is the primary. The other classes like Neutral might not fit here. Wait, the example for CoCoXY is when comparing two cited studies, not the current paper. Here, it's comparing current results with cited results, so CoCoRes is correct. So the top three would be CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral if there's any descriptive part, but the example given for Neutral is more about stating facts without comparison. Since the passage is explicitly comparing results, Neutral might not be appropriate. Wait, maybe the third is Basis or something else. Hmm. Let me check again. The example for CoCoRes is exactly like the one given. So the first is CoCoRes. The second and third might be other classes if applicable. But the passage only mentions comparing results with the cited work. There's no mention of future work, motivation, or support. So maybe the other two are Neutral and CoCoXY? Wait, CoCoXY is when comparing two cited studies. Since this is comparing current work with cited, CoCoXY isn't applicable. So after CoCoRes, maybe Neutral? But Neutral is when the citation is used descriptively without supporting, comparing, etc. In this case, it's a comparison, so Neutral isn't the right fit. Wait, maybe the third is Basis? No, Basis is foundational. So maybe the only correct class here is CoCoRes. But the instructions say to provide top three. Since the passage only discusses a direct comparison of results, the first is CoCoRes. The other two might be Neutral and something else. Wait, perhaps Neutral is the second if there's any descriptive part, but the example for Neutral is like stating facts. Alternatively, maybe the third is Neutral. But I'm not sure. Maybe the user expects three classes even if only one is clear. Let me think again. The example given for CoCoRes is similar to the context here. The user's example is "substantially differ from the results of the experiments... @@CITATION@@", which matches our case. So CoCoRes is first. Then, perhaps the other classes are Neutral and CoCoGM? But CoCoGM is comparison of goals or methods. Since the passage mentions results, not goals or methods, CoCoGM isn't applicable. So maybe Neutral is second, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the third is Basis. Hmm. Maybe the answer is CoCoRes first, then Neutral second, then maybe something else. But I'm not sure. Let me check again. The user's example for CoCoRes is exactly like the given context. So the top three would be CoCoRes as first, then maybe Neutral if there's any descriptive aspect, but the passage is a comparison. Wait, Neutral is when the citation is used descriptively without supporting or comparing. Here, it's a comparison. So Neutral isn't appropriate. Then maybe the third is something else. Wait, the instructions say to return three classes even if the others are less relevant. Maybe the other two are Neutral and Basis. But Basis is foundational. So perhaps the answer is CoCoRes first, Neutral second, and Basis third. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe CoCoRes is the only relevant one, and the other two are Neutral and something else. Since the user requires three, I'll proceed with CoCoRes first, then Neutral, then maybe Basis. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, maybe the third is Weakness. But Weakness is when criticizing the cited work. Here, it's just comparing results. So Weakness isn't applicable. Hmm. Maybe the correct top three are CoCoRes, then Neutral, then maybe CoCoGM. But CoCoGM isn't applicable. So perhaps CoCoRes is first, then Neutral, then maybe Basis. But Basis is foundational. I'm stuck. Let me check the example again. The example for CoCoRes is exactly like the given context. So CoCoRes is definitely first. For the second and third, maybe Neutral and something else. Wait, maybe the passage is also stating a fact neutrally, hence Neutral. But the context is a comparison. Hmm. Maybe Neutral isn't appropriate. Alternatively, maybe the answer is CoCoRes, then CoCoXY (if comparing two cited studies), but in this case, it's comparing cited work with current results. So CoCoXY isn't applicable. Therefore, the top three are CoCoRes first, then Neutral second, then maybe Basis third. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the other two are Neutral and CoCoGM. But since CoCoGM is about goals or methods, which aren't mentioned here. So perhaps the answer is CoCoRes first, then Neutral second, then Basis third. But I'm not certain. Maybe the user expects only CoCoRes and then Neutral and something else. Since I have to provide three, I'll go with CoCoRes first, then Neutral second, then Basis third. But I'm not sure if Basis is correct. Alternatively, maybe Neutral isn't applicable here. Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is CoCoRes first, then Neutral second, then maybe CoCoGM third. But again, CoCoGM isn't applicable. I think the safest answer here is CoCoRes first, then Neutral second, then maybe Basis third. But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, maybe the user expects only CoCoRes and two others. Maybe the answer is CoCoRes, then maybe CoCoXY and Neutral. But CoCoXY isn't applicable. Alright, I'll proceed with CoCoRes as the first, then Neutral as second, then maybe Basis as third. But I'm not sure. Let me check the definitions again. Neutral is when the citation is used descriptively. In the given context, the citation is part of a comparison, so Neutral isn't the right fit. Wait, maybe the answer is CoCoRes first, then maybe Basis and Neutral. Hmm. I think I need to stick with CoCoRes as the primary class, then maybe Neutral and something else. Since I'm stuck, I'll proceed with CoCoRes as first, then Neutral second, then Basis third, even though I'm not certain.
