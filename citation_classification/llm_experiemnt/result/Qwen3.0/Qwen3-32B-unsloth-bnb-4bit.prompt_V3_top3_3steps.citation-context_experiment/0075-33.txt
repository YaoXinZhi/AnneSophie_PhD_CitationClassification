Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. First, I need to look at the context around the citation marked @@CITATION@@ in the provided passage. The passage says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@."

So the key part here is comparing the current results with those from a previous study. The author is pointing out that their findings are substantially different. According to the definitions, CoCoRes is when the citation is used to compare or contrast results or findings directly with the citing paper. That fits perfectly here because they're contrasting their results with the cited experiments.

Next, I need to see if there's any other possible class. The example given for CoCoRes is very similar to this case. The phrase "substantially differ from the results" clearly indicates a direct comparison of results. 

Now, looking at other possible classes: CoCoGM would involve comparing goals or methods, but the passage doesn't mention differing goals or methods, just results. CoCoXY is about comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies, which isn't the case here. Basis is foundational, which doesn't fit because they're contrasting results, not building on foundational work. Support or Similar would imply agreement, which is the opposite of what's stated. Motivation or Future aren't relevant here either. Weakness would be if they were criticizing the cited work, but it's more about differing results rather than pointing out flaws. Neutral is when there's no specific argument, which isn't the case here.

So the top class is definitely CoCoRes. Then, maybe Neutral if there's any neutral mention, but the context is clearly argumentative in comparing results. The third could be CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two studies, but the example for CoCoXY involves comparing two cited studies with each other, not the citing paper. Therefore, the third might be Neutral or Basis, but Basis isn't fitting. So Neutral might be the third if there's any neutral information, but the main intent is CoCoRes. Maybe there's no other strong class, so Neutral could be the third as a fallback.
