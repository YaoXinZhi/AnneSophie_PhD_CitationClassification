Okay, let's tackle this classification problem step by step. First, I need to look at the citation marked @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. The passage says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." 

Step 1 is to extract the context around the citation. The key part here is that the authors are comparing their results to those from previous experiments using specific metal targets. The phrase "substantially differ from" indicates a direct comparison of results.

Step 2 is determining the general intent. Since they're contrasting their findings with those cited, this falls under comparative intent, specifically comparing results. According to the definitions, this points towards CoCoRes. 

Step 3 is ranking the top three rhetorical classes. The most obvious is CoCoRes because they're directly contrasting results. Next, maybe CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two cited studies, but the example for CoCoXY involves comparing two studies with each other, not the citing paper. Here, the comparison is between the current work and the cited work, so CoCoRes is primary. Then, perhaps Neutral if there's no strong argumentation, but the example given for Neutral is more descriptive. Alternatively, maybe Support if they're using the citation to back their claim of difference. However, the example for Support is about confirming findings, not contrasting. So Neutral might be secondary here. The third could be Basis if the cited work is foundational, but the context is about differing results, not foundational. So Neutral might fit as the third.
