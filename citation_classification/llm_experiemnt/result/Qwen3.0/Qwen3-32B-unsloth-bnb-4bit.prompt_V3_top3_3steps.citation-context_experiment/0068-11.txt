Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the citation marked @@CITATION@@. The passage mentions, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." 

So the context here is about comparing the current results with those from a previous study using different metal targets. The key phrase is "substantially differ from the results," which indicates a direct comparison of outcomes between the two studies. 

Next, determining the general intent. Since the authors are contrasting their findings with those cited, this points to a comparative intent. Looking at the categories, Comparative falls under CoCoRes (Comparison of Results) because they are directly comparing results.

Now, ranking the top three rhetorical classes. The primary class here is definitely CoCoRes. Then, considering other possibilities, maybe there's a slight mention of contrasting explanations (CoCoXY), but the example given for CoCoXY involves comparing two cited studies with each other, not the citing paper. Here, the comparison is between the current work and the cited study, so CoCoRes is more accurate. Neutral might come in if there's no strong argumentation, but the example provided for Neutral is more descriptive without comparison. Since the citation is used to highlight a difference in results, CoCoRes is first, then maybe Neutral if there's no further argumentation. However, the example for Neutral doesn't involve comparison, so perhaps Neutral isn't the best fit here. Wait, the example for CoCoXY is when comparing two cited studies, not the current one. Since this citation is comparing the current results with the cited ones, CoCoRes is the primary. The next could be Basis if they're building on foundational work, but the example for Basis is about introducing a method. Here, it's about differing results, so maybe CoCoRes is first, then perhaps Neutral if there's no further analysis. Hmm, but Neutral is when the citation is just descriptive. The example given for Neutral is stating facts without comparison. Since the citation here is used to compare results, CoCoRes is the top, then maybe CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two cited studies, but in this case, it's between current and cited. So CoCoRes is first. The next could be Neutral if the citation isn't supporting or criticizing, just stating the difference. Wait, the example for CoCoRes is about differing results, which matches the given context. So CoCoRes is 1. Then, maybe Neutral if there's no further argumentation, but the example for Neutral is more about stating facts without comparison. Alternatively, maybe CoCoXY if comparing explanations, but the example for CoCoXY involves conflicting results between two studies. Here, the current study is compared with the cited one, so CoCoRes is correct. The second could be Neutral if the citation is just descriptive, but the example for Neutral is when the citation is used to state a fact without supporting or comparing. However, in this case, the citation is used to contrast results, which is more active than Neutral. Maybe the next is CoCoGM if comparing methods, but the example for CoCoGM is about goals or methods. The passage here mentions different metal targets, which could be methods. Wait, the cited study used deuterium saturated metal targets, while the current one's methods differ. So maybe CoCoGM is also applicable here. But the example for CoCoGM is about comparing goals or methods. The passage here says "the results... differ from experiments conducted with..." which could imply different methods. So perhaps CoCoGM is also relevant. However, the primary intent is comparing results, so CoCoRes is first. Then, maybe CoCoGM as a secondary comparison of methods. The third could be Neutral if there's no further argumentation. Alternatively, maybe CoCoXY if there's conflicting explanations. But the example for CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies. Here, it's between current and cited. So perhaps CoCoRes is first, then CoCoGM if methods are compared, then Neutral. Alternatively, maybe Neutral isn't the best third. Wait, the example for Neutral is when the citation is used descriptively. The given context is using the citation to compare results, which is more active than Neutral. So maybe after CoCoRes, the next could be CoCoXY if there's conflicting explanations, but the example for CoCoXY is between two cited studies. Since here it's between current and cited, CoCoXY isn't applicable. Then maybe Neutral is the third. But Neutral is when the citation is just stating facts without supporting or comparing. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe Weakness if the cited study has limitations, but the example for Weakness is about problematic taxonomy. Here, the cited study's results are different, but not necessarily flawed. So Weakness isn't applicable. So the top three would be CoCoRes, then maybe CoCoGM if methods are compared, then Neutral. Wait, the example for CoCoGM is comparing goals or methods. The passage mentions different metal targets (TiD, TaD, etc.), which are methods. So the comparison is between methods (different targets), which would be CoCoGM. Therefore, the citation is used to compare results (CoCoRes) and methods (CoCoGM). So the top two would be CoCoRes and CoCoGM. The third could be Neutral if there's no further argumentation. But the example for Neutral is when the citation is just stating a fact. Since the citation is used to contrast results and methods, maybe Neutral isn't the best third. Alternatively, maybe Similar isn't applicable here. The example for Similar is pointing out similarities. Here, it's differences, so Similar isn't right. Future isn't applicable. Motivation isn't here. Basis is about foundational work. So the top three would be CoCoRes, CoCoGM, and Neutral. Wait, Neutral is when the citation is used descriptively. But in this case, the citation is used to contrast results and methods. Hmm. Maybe Neutral isn't the best third. Alternatively, maybe the third is CoCoXY if comparing explanations, but that's between two cited studies. I think the correct ranking is CoCoRes first, CoCoGM second, and Neutral third. But Neutral might not be accurate here. Alternatively, maybe the third is CoCoXY if there's conflicting results mentioned. The example for CoCoXY is conflicting results between two studies. Here, the current study's results differ from the cited one, which could be seen as conflicting. So perhaps CoCoXY is applicable here. Wait, the example for CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies. In the given context, the comparison is between the current work and the cited study. So CoCoXY isn't applicable. Therefore, the top three are CoCoRes, CoCoGM, and Neutral. But Neutral seems off. Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me check the example again. The example for CoCoRes is "substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with..." which matches the given context. So CoCoRes is definitely first. The comparison of methods (different metal targets) would be CoCoGM. So CoCoGM is second. Then, maybe Neutral is third if there's no further argumentation. But Neutral is when the citation is just descriptive. Since the citation is used to compare results and methods, Neutral isn't the best fit. Maybe the third is CoCoXY if there's conflicting explanations between two cited studies, but that's not the case here. Therefore, the correct ranking is CoCoRes, CoCoGM, and Neutral. But Neutral might not be appropriate. Alternatively, maybe the third is Basis if the cited work is foundational, but the example for Basis is introducing a method. Here, the cited work's results are different, so Basis isn't applicable. Hmm. Maybe Neutral is the best third option here. So the final answer is CoCoRes, CoCoGM, Neutral.
