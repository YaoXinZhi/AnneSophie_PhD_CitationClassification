Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation marked @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." 

So the key part here is that the authors are comparing their results with those from a previous study. The example given for CoCoRes is similar, where they mention differing results from cited experiments. That makes me think this is a CoCoRes case because they're directly comparing their findings with the cited work's results.

Next, looking at the general intent. The sentence is contrasting their results with the cited ones, which fits under Comparative â†’ CoCoRes. There's no mention of methods or goals here, so CoCoGM isn't likely. Also, no support or motivation is indicated. 

Now, checking if there's any other possible classes. The example for CoCoXY involves comparing two cited studies with each other, not the citing paper. Here, the comparison is between the current work and the cited work, so CoCoRes is the main one. Neutral might be a stretch here because they are making a direct comparison, not just stating facts. Support isn't applicable since they're pointing out differences, not supporting their own work. 

So the top three would be CoCoRes first. Then maybe Neutral if there's any other context, but the example given is pretty direct. Wait, maybe there's a slight possibility of Neutral if the citation is just being used to state facts, but the main intent is comparison. The example for CoCoRes is very similar, so that's definitely first. Second could be CoCoXY if there's another comparison between studies, but here it's between their work and the cited work. So CoCoRes is the primary. Third might be Neutral if there's no other intent, but I don't see another class fitting here. Wait, maybe Basis? No, Basis is foundational work, which isn't the case here. So the top three are CoCoRes, then maybe Neutral as a lower priority if any, but the example doesn't suggest that. Hmm. Maybe the next could be Support if they're using the citation to support their contrast, but that's not quite right. Alternatively, maybe Weakness if they're pointing out flaws, but they're just stating differences. So Weakness might not apply. 

I think the top three are CoCoRes, Neutral, and maybe CoCoXY if there's another comparison, but the example here is straightforward CoCoRes. So finalizing, it's CoCoRes first, then Neutral if there's no other class, but I'm not sure. Wait, the example given for Neutral is just stating a fact without argument. Here, they are contrasting results, so Neutral isn't fitting. Maybe the third is CoCoXY if there's another comparison, but the example here is between their work and the cited work. So maybe CoCoRes is the only one. But the task asks for top three. Hmm. Maybe Neutral is the third if there's no other. Wait, maybe the example given for Neutral is different. Let me check again. Neutral example is citing a fact without supporting or comparing. Here, the citation is part of a comparison, so Neutral isn't appropriate. Then maybe the third is something else. Wait, maybe the example is a direct comparison, so CoCoRes is first, then perhaps Basis if the cited work is foundational, but the example here is contrasting results, not foundational. So maybe CoCoRes is first, then Neutral as third if there's no other. Alternatively, perhaps Weakness if the cited work's results are being criticized. But the passage says "substantially differ," not necessarily that the cited work is flawed. So Weakness might not apply. Therefore, the top three are CoCoRes, then maybe CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two cited works, but here it's only one. So the third might be Neutral. But I'm not sure. Maybe Neutral isn't the right fit here. Hmm. Given the example, maybe CoCoRes is the only one, but the task requires three. Maybe the third is Neutral as a fallback. So finalizing:

1. CoCoRes
2. Neutral
3. CoCoXY

Wait, but CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies, which isn't the case here. So maybe Neutral is the third. Alternatively, maybe Weakness. But the example doesn't indicate criticism. Hmm. I think the correct answer is CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral as second and third if forced. But I'm not certain. Given the example in the instructions, the correct answer is CoCoRes.
