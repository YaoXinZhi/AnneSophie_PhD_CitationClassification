Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation marked @@CITATION@@. The passage says, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." 

The key part here is comparing the current results with those from the cited experiments. The author is directly contrasting their findings against previous ones. 

Next, identifying the general intent. Since the sentence starts with "substantially differ," it's a direct comparison of results. That points towards the Comparative category, specifically CoCoRes. 

Looking at the examples, CoCoRes is when results are compared or contrasted with the cited work. The example given is very similar to the current case. 

Now, the other possible classes. The comparison is between the current study and the cited one, not between two cited studies (so CoCoXY is less likely). There's no mention of methods or goals, so CoCoGM isn't fitting. The citation isn't supporting the current work's argument but contrasting it, so Support or Similar aren't right. 

Neutral might be considered if it was just stating facts without comparison, but here it's a direct contrast. Weakness would involve criticism, which isn't the case here. 

So the top class is definitely CoCoRes. The second could be Neutral if there's any descriptive aspect, but since it's a direct comparison, maybe Neutral isn't next. Wait, maybe CoCoXY is possible if comparing explanations, but the example there involves two cited studies. Here it's current vs cited, so CoCoRes is primary. Future, Motivation, Usage don't fit. 

So the top three would be CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral if there's a neutral comparison, but the example for Neutral is more like stating facts. Alternatively, maybe CoCoRes is first, then perhaps CoCoGM if there's a method comparison, but the context is about results. 

Wait, the example for CoCoRes says "directly compare or contrast the results or findings," which matches the sentence. So CoCoRes is first. 

Then, maybe the next could be Neutral if there's a neutral mention, but the sentence is actively contrasting results. Alternatively, maybe CoCoXY if comparing explanations, but the example for CoCoXY involves two cited studies. Here it's the current study vs cited, so CoCoXY isn't fitting. 

So the top three are CoCoRes, then maybe Neutral if there's a descriptive element, but I think CoCoRes is the only one here. Wait, the task says to rank top three even if only one is clear. Maybe Neutral is third, but the example for Neutral is more like stating facts without argument. Since the sentence is contrasting results, Neutral isn't really applicable here. 

Wait, maybe the next is CoCoXY if the comparison is between explanations, but the example in CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies. Here, the comparison is between current work and cited work. So CoCoRes is the main one, then maybe Neutral if there's no other clear classes. 

Alternatively, perhaps the second could be CoCoGM if there's a mention of methods, but the context here is about results. So CoCoRes is first, then maybe Neutral as third. But I'm not sure. Let me check the definitions again. 

The example for Neutral is when the citation is used in a neutral descriptive way. The given sentence is contrasting results, so Neutral isn't applicable. So maybe CoCoRes is first, then perhaps CoCoGM if there's a method comparison. Wait, the context mentions "experiments conducted with deuterium saturated metal targets," which could imply methods. But the sentence is about results differing. 

Hmm. The example for CoCoRes is comparing results, so that's the primary class. The next could be CoCoGM if the methods are compared, but the sentence doesn't mention methods. The context is about results. So maybe CoCoRes is first, then Neutral, then maybe Future or another. 

Alternatively, maybe Weakness if the cited work's results are being criticized, but the sentence says the current results differ substantially, not that the cited work is flawed. 

So the top three are CoCoRes first, then Neutral if there's any neutral aspect, but maybe Neutral isn't right. Perhaps the second is CoCoXY if comparing explanations, but again, the example for CoCoXY is between two cited studies. 

Wait, the example for CoCoXY is "conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima @@CITATION@." That's comparing two cited studies. Here, the comparison is between the current work and the cited work. So CoCoRes is the correct class. 

Therefore, the top three rhetorical classes would be CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral if there's a neutral mention, but I'm not sure. Since the sentence is contrasting results, Neutral isn't fitting. Maybe CoCoRes is the only one, but the task requires three. Perhaps Neutral is third as a fallback. 

Alternatively, maybe the second could be CoCoGM if the methods are compared. The cited work used deuterium saturated metal targets, and the current work's experiments might have different methods. But the sentence doesn't explicitly state that; it's about results. 

So the final ranking is CoCoRes as first, then maybe Neutral as second and third. Wait, but Neutral isn't applicable here. Hmm. Maybe the second is CoCoXY if the comparison is between explanations, but again, the example isn't matching. 

After careful consideration, the top three should be CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral as second, then CoCoGM third. But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, maybe CoCoRes is the only correct one, and the others are less applicable. 

Given the instructions require three, perhaps the answer is:

1. CoCoRes  
2. Neutral  
3. CoCoGM  

But I'm not sure. Wait, the example for CoCoRes is direct comparison of results, which fits. Neutral is when it's descriptive without argument. Since the sentence is contrasting results, Neutral isn't right. CoCoGM is about methods or goals. The cited work's method is mentioned (deuterium saturated targets), but the comparison is about results. So maybe CoCoGM isn't applicable. 

Therefore, the correct answer is CoCoRes first, then maybe CoCoXY if comparing explanations, but the example doesn't match. 

I think the correct top three are:

1. CoCoRes  
2. Neutral  
3. CoCoXY  

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe only CoCoRes is correct, and the others are not. Given the example for CoCoXY involves comparing two cited studies, this is a comparison between current and cited, so CoCoXY isn't fitting. 

So final answer:

1. CoCoRes  
2. Neutral  
3. CoCoGM  

But I'm still unsure. Maybe Neutral isn't applicable here. Perhaps the correct answer is CoCoRes as the only one, but the task requires three. Maybe the second is CoCoXY if comparing explanations, but again, the example isn't matching. 

After rechecking, the correct answer is CoCoRes first, then Neutral second, and CoCoXY third. But Neutral isn't really fitting. Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is CoCoRes, then maybe Weakness third, but the cited work isn't criticized. 

This is tricky. Based on the example given for CoCoRes, which matches the context, the top class is CoCoRes. The next could be Neutral if there's a neutral mention, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe CoCoXY is third if there's a comparison between explanations, but again, the example doesn't match. 

Given the instructions, I'll proceed with CoCoRes as first, then Neutral, then CoCoXY as the top three.
