Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the citation tagged @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. The passage mentions, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." 

So, the context here is comparing the current study's results with those from a previous study that used different metal targets. The key phrase is "substantially differ," which indicates a direct comparison of results.

Next, determining the general intent. The authors are contrasting their findings with existing experimental results. This falls under the Comparative category, specifically comparing results. According to the definitions, CoCoRes is for comparing results or findings. 

Now, looking at the top three rhetorical classes. The primary class here is CoCoRes because the citation is directly contrasting results. The next possible class might be CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two cited studies, but in this case, the comparison is between the current work and the cited study, not between two cited studies. So CoCoXY isn't applicable here. 

The third class could be Neutral if the citation is just descriptive, but since the comparison is explicit and critical, Neutral is less likely. However, the example for CoCoRes includes a direct comparison of results, which matches here. The other possible classes like Support or Basis don't fit because the citation isn't supporting the current work nor is it foundational. 

Therefore, the top three classes are CoCoRes as the primary, followed by CoCoGM if there's a mention of methods or goals, but in the example given, the comparison is about results, so maybe CoCoRes is the only primary. Wait, the example given for CoCoRes is similar to the user's case. The user's example says "substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted..." which is exactly what's in the passage. So CoCoRes is definitely first. 

Looking at the other options, maybe there's a secondary intent. If the authors are contrasting their methods or goals, but the passage doesn't mention methods or goals, just results. So the next possible could be Neutral, but the comparison is explicit, so Neutral is not appropriate. 

Wait, the example for CoCoRes is "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." Which matches exactly the user's passage. So CoCoRes is definitely first. 

For the second and third, maybe CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two cited studies, but here it's between current work and cited study. So perhaps Neutral is third. But Neutral is for when the citation is descriptive without supporting or comparing. However, in this case, the citation is used to compare results, so Neutral isn't the right fit. 

Alternatively, maybe Weakness if the cited work's results are being criticized, but the passage doesn't state that. It just states the results differ. So Weakness isn't appropriate. 

Therefore, the top three would be CoCoRes as first, then maybe CoCoGM if there's a mention of methods, but the example doesn't mention methods, only results. So perhaps CoCoRes is the only primary, and the others are less applicable. Wait, but the instructions require three classes. Since the passage is comparing results, CoCoRes is first. Then maybe CoCoXY if comparing explanations, but the example given for CoCoXY involves comparing two cited studies, not the current work. So CoCoXY isn't applicable here. 

Hmm, perhaps the second class is CoCoGM if the methods are different. The cited work used deuterium saturated metal targets, while the current work might have different methods. So comparing goals or methods could be CoCoGM. But the passage doesn't mention goals, only results. So maybe CoCoGM isn't the right fit. 

Alternatively, maybe the second class is CoCoRes again, but that's not possible. Wait, maybe Neutral is third. But Neutral is for when the citation is just descriptive. Since the citation is used to compare results, Neutral isn't correct. 

This is tricky. Let me recheck the definitions. 

CoCoRes: comparison of results between current work and cited work. 

CoCoGM: comparison of goals or methods between current work and cited work. 

CoCoXY: comparison between two cited studies. 

In the given passage, the comparison is between current work and cited work's results. So CoCoRes is first. There's no mention of goals or methods, so CoCoGM isn't applicable. Therefore, the next possible classes could be Neutral or Weakness. But Neutral is when the citation is just descriptive without any comparison. Since there's a direct comparison of results, Neutral isn't right. Weakness would require criticism, which isn't present here. 

So maybe the top three are CoCoRes, then perhaps Neutral and CoCoGM. But CoCoGM isn't applicable. Wait, maybe the cited study's methods are different (using deuterium saturated metal targets), so comparing methods would be CoCoGM. The passage mentions "experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets," which refers to the methods. So comparing methods between current and cited work would be CoCoGM. 

Wait, the current work's methods aren't described here, but the cited work's methods are mentioned (deuterium saturated metal targets). The comparison is about results, but the methods used in the cited work are different. So maybe the citation is used to compare methods (CoCoGM) as well as results (CoCoRes). 

So the first class is CoCoRes, second is CoCoGM, third is Neutral. Because the cited work's methods are different (deuterium targets), and the current work's methods aren't stated but are presumably different, leading to a comparison of methods. 

Therefore, the top three would be CoCoRes (primary), CoCoGM (secondary), and Neutral (tertiary). But Neutral might not fit. Alternatively, maybe the third is CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two cited studies, but there's only one citation here. 

Wait, the example given for CoCoRes includes a comparison between current work and cited work's results. So the primary is CoCoRes. The methods used in the cited work are mentioned, but the current work's methods aren't discussed here. So perhaps CoCoGM isn't applicable unless the goals or methods are compared. Since the cited work's methods are mentioned (deuterium targets), but the current work's methods aren't discussed, maybe CoCoGM isn't applicable. 

Therefore, the second and third classes might be Neutral or Weakness. But Weakness isn't applicable. Neutral is when the citation is just descriptive. Since the citation is used to compare results, Neutral isn't correct. 

Hmm, this is challenging. Let me look back at the example for CoCoRes. The example given is exactly like the user's passage, so CoCoRes is definitely first. The second could be CoCoGM if there's a method comparison. Since the cited work's methods are mentioned (deuterium targets), and the current work's methods are presumably different (since the results differ), maybe CoCoGM is applicable. 

So the top three would be CoCoRes (1), CoCoGM (2), and Neutral (3). But Neutral is for when the citation is neutral, which isn't the case here. 

Alternatively, maybe the third is CoCoXY, but that's between two cited studies. Since there's only one citation here, CoCoXY isn't applicable. 

Therefore, the final answer is CoCoRes as first, then maybe CoCoGM if the methods are compared, and Neutral as third if there's no other applicable classes. But Neutral isn't correct here. 

Wait, perhaps the third class is CoCoXY if the cited work is compared with another study, but there's only one citation. So maybe the third class is Neutral. But Neutral isn't correct. 

This is confusing. Let me stick with the primary being CoCoRes, and the other two might be CoCoGM and CoCoXY. But CoCoXY isn't applicable here. 

I think the correct answer is CoCoRes as first, then maybe CoCoGM as second if methods are compared, and Neutral as third. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the third is CoCoXY, but that's not applicable. 

Given the example provided by the user matches CoCoRes exactly, I'll go with CoCoRes as first. The second could be CoCoGM if there's a method comparison, and third might be Neutral, even though it's not perfect. 

So the final answer would be:

1. CoCoRes
2. CoCoGM
3. Neutral

1. CoCoRes  
2. CoCoGM  
3. Neutral
