Okay, let's start by looking at the given passage and the citation marked @@CITATION@@. The task is to classify the rhetorical purpose of this citation into the top three classes from the provided list.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage says, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." 

The key part here is "substantially differ from the results of the experiments," which indicates that the authors are comparing their results with those from the cited study. According to the definitions, CoCoRes is used when comparing results directly. So CoCoRes would be the primary class here.

Next, I need to see if there's another class that fits. The comparison is between the current work and the cited work, not between two cited studies or contrasting goals/methods. There's no mention of goals or methods differing, just the results. So CoCoRes is the main one. 

Looking further, the example for CoCoRes matches this scenario exactly. The authors are contrasting their findings with those of the cited paper. There's no indication of supporting their argument with another study's results, nor are they motivating their research based on a gap. The context is purely about differing results, so CoCoRes is the top class.

For the second class, maybe Neutral could be considered if the citation is just stated factually without additional context, but since the sentence is actively contrasting results, Neutral is less likely. The third class might be Basis if the cited work is foundational, but again, the context is about differing results, not foundational work. 

Therefore, the top three classes are CoCoRes first, then perhaps CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two cited studies, but in this case, it's the current work versus the cited one, so CoCoRes remains the primary. The next possible could be Basis if the cited work is foundational, but the example given for Basis doesn't match this context. 

After re-evaluating, CoCoRes is definitely first. The second might be CoCoGM if there's a comparison of goals or methods, but the sentence focuses on results. The third could be Neutral as a fallback if no other classes fit better. So the top three would be CoCoRes, then Neutral, then maybe CoCoGM or another. Wait, the example given for CoCoRes is exactly the same structure as the passage here. So CoCoRes is first. The next could be CoCoXY if comparing two cited works, but in this case, it's current work versus cited. So Neutral might be second if there's no other applicable class. Alternatively, maybe Support if the cited work supports the current argument, but since they're contrasting results, Support isn't right. 

So finalizing, CoCoRes is first. Then maybe Neutral if there's no further comparison. The example given for Neutral is a descriptive citation without argument, but in this case, the citation is part of a contrast, so Neutral might not fit. Wait, the example for CoCoRes is the direct comparison of results. Therefore, CoCoRes is the only clear one. The next two might be Neutral and another, but maybe Neutral isn't applicable here. Alternatively, perhaps Weakness if the cited work's results are being questioned, but the passage says the results differ, not that they're flawed. 

So the top three would be CoCoRes, then maybe Neutral, then Basis. But Basis is about foundational work, which isn't indicated here. So perhaps the top three are CoCoRes, Neutral, and then another like CoCoGM. Wait, but the context is about results, not goals or methods. So maybe CoCoRes is first, then Neutral, then CoCoXY. But CoCoXY is comparing two cited works, which isn't the case here. 

Hmm. Let me check again. The example for CoCoRes is "substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted..." which matches exactly. So CoCoRes is definitely first. The next could be Neutral if the citation is just stating a fact without further argument. But since the citation is part of a comparison, Neutral might not be right. Alternatively, maybe Weakness if the cited results are being criticized, but the passage doesn't say they're flawed, just different. 

Therefore, the top three are CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral second, then CoCoGM third. But I'm not sure. Wait, the example for CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies, not the current work and a cited study. So CoCoXY isn't applicable here. 

So the final answer would be CoCoRes as first, then perhaps Neutral as second if there's no other applicable class. But maybe there's no second class. Wait, the task says to list the top three, even if some are less certain. Given that, the top three would be CoCoRes, then maybe Neutral, then Basis. But Basis is about foundational work, which isn't indicated here. 

After careful consideration, the correct classes are CoCoRes first, then Neutral second, and perhaps CoCoGM third. But I think CoCoRes is the only clear one, and the other two might not fit well. However, the task requires three classes. Given that, I'll proceed with CoCoRes as first, then Neutral, then maybe Weakness, but Weakness requires criticism, which isn't present. 

Wait, the example for Weakness is pointing out limitations, but here it's just a difference. So Weakness isn't applicable. Therefore, the top three would be CoCoRes, Neutral, and then maybe CoCoXY. But CoCoXY is comparing two cited works. Hmm. 

Given the strict definitions, the correct answer is CoCoRes first, then Neutral second, then maybe Basis third. But Basis is about foundational work. Since the citation is about differing results, Basis isn't correct. 

I think the correct top three are CoCoRes, Neutral, and then maybe CoCoXY. But CoCoXY isn't applicable here. Therefore, the top three are CoCoRes, then Neutral, then maybe another Neutral, but Neutral can only be once. Wait, the list requires three distinct classes. 

After rechecking all definitions, the only applicable is CoCoRes. The other two might not fit. However, the task requires three. Maybe Neutral is second, and then maybe Basis third. But Basis isn't correct. Alternatively, perhaps Motivation is third. But Motivation is about justifying the current research. 

Given the strict definitions, the correct answer is CoCoRes first, then Neutral second, then Basis third. But I'm not confident. However, based on the example given for CoCoRes matching exactly, the first is definitely CoCoRes. The second might be Neutral if the citation is just descriptive. The third could be CoCoGM or another class. But without more context, Neutral might be the next. So the final answer is CoCoRes, Neutral, and then Basis.
