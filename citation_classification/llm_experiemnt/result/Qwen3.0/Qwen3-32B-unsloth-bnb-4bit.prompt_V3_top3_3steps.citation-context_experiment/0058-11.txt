Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The sentence is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." 

The key part here is the comparison between the present results and those from the cited work. The author is pointing out a substantial difference. Looking at the rhetorical classes, CoCoRes is about comparing results directly. That seems like the top choice.

Next, the author mentions the experiments conducted with deuterium saturated metal targets. This could imply a comparison of methods or goals, but since the focus is on the results differing, CoCoGM might not be as relevant here. However, since the context is about experimental setup, maybe CoCoGM is a secondary consideration. But the example given for CoCoRes is very similar to this case, so CoCoRes is primary.

Is there any other comparison happening? The example for CoCoXY involves comparing two cited studies, but here the comparison is between the current work and the cited one. So CoCoXY isn't applicable here. 

The author isn't supporting their own findings with the citation, nor are they motivating their research based on it. They're contrasting results. So Motivation and Support are out. Weakness would be if they were criticizing the cited work, but it's more about differing results, not flaws. Neutral would be if it's just stating facts without comparison, but here there's a direct comparison. 

So the top three would be CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral if there's any neutral description, but the main intent is comparison. Wait, the example for Neutral is when the citation is used descriptively. In this case, the citation is used to compare results, so Neutral isn't the best fit. Maybe the second could be CoCoGM if there's a method comparison, but the sentence focuses on results. Hmm. Alternatively, if there's no other applicable classes, maybe Neutral comes in third. But the example given for Neutral is when the citation is just descriptive without argument. Since the author is contrasting results, Neutral isn't the main class. So the top three would be CoCoRes, then maybe Basis if they're building on foundational work, but the example for Basis is about introducing a method. Here, the cited work's results are being contrasted, not foundational. 

Wait, maybe the third is Neutral because the citation is just referencing past results without further argument beyond comparison. But the primary class is CoCoRes. So the top three would be CoCoRes, then maybe CoCoGM if the methods are compared, but the sentence mentions results. Hmm. The example for CoCoRes is exactly matching this scenario. So CoCoRes is definitely first. The second could be Neutral if the citation is also serving a descriptive purpose. Alternatively, maybe there's no second class applicable, but the instructions require three. Maybe Neutral is third here. Let me check the example again. The Neutral example is a descriptive citation without comparison, but here the citation is used for comparison, so Neutral isn't the second. Maybe the third is Basis if the cited work is foundational, but in this case, the cited work is being contrasted, not as a foundation. 

So the top three are CoCoRes, then perhaps Neutral and CoCoGM as lower. Wait, maybe CoCoGM isn't applicable here. Since the comparison is about results, not goals or methods. So the third could be Neutral. So final list: 1. CoCoRes, 2. Neutral, 3. CoCoGM. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe Neutral isn't the second. Maybe the third is Basis. Hmm. Let me think again. The sentence is contrasting results, so CoCoRes is first. There's no other comparison happening here. So perhaps the other two classes aren't applicable. But the instructions require three. Maybe Neutral is third because the citation is also mentioning the experiments conducted, which is descriptive. So Neutral could be third. Alternatively, maybe CoCoXY if comparing two cited works, but here it's one cited work compared to the current one. So CoCoXY isn't applicable. 

So the top three would be CoCoRes, then maybe Neutral, then perhaps Basis or Weakness. But Basis is when the cited work is foundational. Since the cited work's results are being compared, not used as a foundation. Weakness would be if the cited work's results are flawed, but the author just says they differ. So Weakness isn't it. Therefore, the top three are CoCoRes, then Neutral, then maybe CoCoGM. But I'm not certain about CoCoGM here. Alternatively, maybe CoCoGM isn't applicable. Given the example, the correct answer is CoCoRes first. For the second and third, perhaps Neutral and then maybe something else. Maybe Neutral is the second if the citation is also serving a descriptive role beyond comparison. So the final answer would be 1. CoCoRes, 2. Neutral, 3. CoCoGM.
