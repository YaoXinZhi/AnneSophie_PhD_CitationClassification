Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the citation in question. The passage mentions that the results of the current work substantially differ from those of experiments using deuterium saturated metal targets, referencing the citation. The example given for CoCoRes is similar, where results are directly compared.

The general intent here is comparative, focusing on contrasting results. So the primary class should be CoCoRes. Next, there's a mention of conflicting results in another study, which relates to CoCoXY as it's comparing two cited studies. The rest of the context doesn't support other classes like Support or Motivation. Neutral is less likely here because the citation is actively comparing results, not just stating facts. So the top three would be CoCoRes, CoCoXY, and maybe Neutral as a lower rank since there's some descriptive mention of the studies.
