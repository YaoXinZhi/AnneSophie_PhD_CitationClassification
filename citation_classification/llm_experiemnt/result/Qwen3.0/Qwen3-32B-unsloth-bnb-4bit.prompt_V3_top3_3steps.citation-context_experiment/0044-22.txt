Okay, let's tackle this classification problem step by step. First, I need to understand the context around the citation marked @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. The passage says, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." 

So, the main point here is that the current study's results are different from those cited in the reference. The key words are "substantially differ" which indicates a comparison between the results of the current work and the cited experiments. 

Moving to Step 2: Identifying the general intent. The citation is being used to contrast the results of the cited work with the current study. According to the predefined categories, this falls under Comparative intent. The specific rhetorical classes under Comparative are CoCoGM (Comparison of Goals or Methods), CoCoRes (Comparison of Results), and CoCoXY (Comparison of Explanations or Claims). 

In the example given for CoCoRes, the citation is used to compare results directly, which matches our case here. The example provided in the instructions is almost identical in structure to the current passage. So CoCoRes is the primary class here. 

Next, are there any other classes that might apply? The passage doesn't mention comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies (which would be CoCoXY), nor does it compare goals or methods (CoCoGM). The citation is solely about contrasting results. However, sometimes a citation might serve multiple purposes, but in this case, the context is straightforward. 

Looking at Neutral, it's used when the citation is just descriptive without supporting or comparing. Here, the citation is actively contrasting results, so Neutral is less likely. Basis, Motivation, Future, Support, Similar, Usage, Weakness, and Neutral don't fit here either. 

So the top three classes would be CoCoRes as the primary. Since there's no secondary or tertiary classes indicated in the context, perhaps the next could be CoCoXY if there's any hint of comparing explanations, but the example given for CoCoXY involves comparing two cited studies, not the current work. Since this is a direct comparison between current and cited results, CoCoRes is the only relevant one. However, the instructions require three classes. Maybe Neutral is the next, but that's a stretch. Alternatively, perhaps Weakness if the cited work's results are being criticized, but the passage states the results differ, not that they're flawed. So Weakness might not fit. 

Wait, the example for CoCoRes is exactly matching the structure here. The example says the results differ from those of the experiments conducted by the cited work. So CoCoRes is definitely the top. Since the instructions require three classes, maybe the next two are Neutral and CoCoXY? But there's no indication of CoCoXY here. Neutral would be if it's just a descriptive mention. However, since the citation is used to contrast results, Neutral isn't appropriate. Maybe the next could be Neutral as the least relevant. Alternatively, perhaps Support or Similar. But the passage doesn't support the current work's results; it's contrasting them. So Neutral is the next best fit as the third. 

So the top three would be CoCoRes (1), then perhaps Neutral (2), and maybe CoCoXY as third if forced, but since there's no comparison between two cited studies, CoCoXY isn't applicable. Therefore, the top three would be CoCoRes, then Neutral, then maybe Weakness. Wait, Weakness is when the cited work is criticized. Here, the results are just different, not necessarily flawed. So Weakness might not apply. Therefore, the third could be Neutral. 

Finalizing, the top three classes are CoCoRes, then Neutral, then maybe CoCoXY. But since CoCoXY requires comparing two cited studies, which isn't the case here, the third might be Neutral. So the answer would be:

1. CoCoRes  
2. Neutral  
3. CoCoXY  

Wait, but CoCoXY isn't applicable here. Hmm. Maybe the third is Weakness. Let me check again. The Weakness class is when the cited work is criticized. The passage says the results differ, which could imply that the cited work's results are incomplete or flawed if the current study's results are considered correct. However, the passage doesn't explicitly state that the cited work is flawed, just that the results differ. So Weakness might not be the right choice. Neutral is more appropriate as the citation is just stating a difference without further critique. Therefore, the top three would be CoCoRes, then Neutral, and perhaps Future if there's an implication of future work, but there's no mention of future directions here. 

So the correct top three are CoCoRes, Neutral, and maybe CoCoXY as third, even though it's not perfect. But according to the example given for CoCoXY, it's when comparing two cited studies, not the current work. Therefore, CoCoXY doesn't apply here. Hence, the third should be Neutral. Wait, but Neutral is already second. Maybe the third is another class. Wait, the instructions require three classes, even if some are less fitting. Given the options, after CoCoRes, Neutral might be the next, and perhaps CoCoGM if there's a comparison of methods, but the passage mentions results, not methods. 

Therefore, the final answer is:

1. CoCoRes  
2. Neutral  
3. CoCoGM  

But wait, CoCoGM is comparison of goals or methods, which isn't mentioned here. Hmm. Maybe Neutral is second, and CoCoRes is first, and the third could be Weakness. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe Neutral is second and CoCoXY is third even if it's not perfect. Given the instructions require three, I'll go with CoCoRes first, then Neutral, then CoCoXY.
