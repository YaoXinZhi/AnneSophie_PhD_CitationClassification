Okay, let's tackle this classification problem step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the citation marked @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. The passage says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." 

So the key part here is comparing the current study's results with those from the cited work. The phrase "substantially differ from the results" clearly indicates a comparison of results. Looking at the predefined classes, CoCoRes is meant for when the citation is used to directly compare or contrast results or findings. That seems like the primary class here.

Next, I need to consider other possible classes. The example given for CoCoRes matches this scenario closely, where results are directly compared. There's no mention of contrasting methods or goals, so CoCoGM isn't applicable here. The citation isn't supporting the current work's findings (which would be Support) or pointing out weaknesses. The context is purely about differing results, so CoCoRes is the top choice.

Now, for the secondary classes. The passage doesn't discuss future work or motivation. It's not neutral either because it's making a direct comparison. The third most likely could be Neutral if there's any ambiguity, but since the comparison is explicit, Neutral might not fit. However, maybe CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two cited studies, but in this case, the comparison is between the current work and the cited one, not between two cited studies. Therefore, CoCoXY isn't applicable here. 

So the top three would be CoCoRes first. For the second and third, perhaps looking at other possible overlaps. If there's any indirect comparison or if the cited work's results are being contrasted in a way that's also a basis for the current study, but the example given for Basis is about foundational work, which doesn't fit here. The primary intent is CoCoRes, with maybe Neutral as the third if there's no other class fitting. Wait, but Neutral is when the citation is used descriptively without supporting, comparing, etc. Since this is a direct comparison, Neutral isn't appropriate. So maybe the second and third could be CoCoXY and then Neutral, but CoCoXY requires comparing two cited studies, which isn't the case here. 

Therefore, the top three should be CoCoRes, then perhaps CoCoGM if there's a methodological comparison, but the example given for CoCoGM is about goals or methods. The passage here is about results, so CoCoRes is the main. The next could be CoCoXY if there's a mention of comparing two studies, but the example here is comparing the current study with the cited one. So maybe CoCoXY isn't applicable. Then, perhaps Neutral as the third, but that's stretching it. Alternatively, maybe there's a Weakness if the cited work's results are being criticized, but the passage just states a difference without criticism. 

So the final ranking is CoCoRes first. For the second and third, perhaps Neutral and then something else. Wait, maybe the comparison of results could imply a basis if the cited work's results are the foundation, but the example for Basis is about introducing a method, not comparing results. So Basis isn't fitting. The correct top three are CoCoRes, Neutral, and maybe Support, but Support is when the citation supports the current work's findings. Here, the results differ, so Support isn't applicable. 

Therefore, the top three classes are CoCoRes as first, Neutral as second if there's any ambiguity, but I'm not sure. Wait, the example for Neutral is a descriptive citation without argument. In this case, the citation is used to compare results, which is argumentative. So Neutral isn't appropriate. Maybe the second could be something else. Wait, maybe the passage is comparing results, so CoCoRes is first. Then perhaps there's a secondary comparison, but the example given is direct comparison. So the top three would be CoCoRes, then maybe CoCoXY if comparing explanations, but the example for CoCoXY is between two cited studies. Since this is between current and cited, CoCoXY isn't applicable. 

Thus, the top three are CoCoRes, then maybe nothing else fits. But the user requires three classes. Maybe Weakness if the cited work's results are being criticized, but the passage just states a difference without criticism. So Weakness isn't correct. Therefore, the correct top three are CoCoRes first, then Neutral if forced, but Neutral doesn't fit. Hmm. Maybe the answer is CoCoRes, then perhaps CoCoGM if there's any mention of methods, but the passage is about results. Therefore, the answer is CoCoRes, Neutral, and then maybe Support or something else. Wait, maybe the comparison of results could be seen as a basis for further analysis, but that's stretching. 

After careful consideration, the correct top three classes are CoCoRes (1), then maybe Neutral (2) if there's no other fit, but Neutral isn't appropriate here. Wait, the example for Neutral is a descriptive citation. Since this is a comparison, Neutral isn't correct. Therefore, the second and third might not have strong candidates. Perhaps CoCoRes is the only correct one, but the task requires three. Maybe the answer is CoCoRes, then CoCoXY (if comparing explanations between cited studies), but the example here is comparing current and cited. So perhaps the answer is CoCoRes, then maybe CoCoGM or something else. 

Given the strict definitions, the correct answer is CoCoRes as first. For the second and third, perhaps Neutral and then Support. But Neutral isn't correct. Maybe the answer is CoCoRes, then CoCoXY, but that's not fitting. Alternatively, maybe the answer is CoCoRes, then nothing else fits. But the user requires three. Maybe the answer is CoCoRes, then CoCoXY, then Neutral. But I'm not sure. However, according to the example given in CoCoRes, this is the exact case. So the top three would be CoCoRes, Neutral, and then perhaps CoCoGM. But I'm not confident. Given the example in CoCoRes matches this scenario, the correct answer is CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral and then something else. However, since Neutral isn't fitting, perhaps the answer is CoCoRes, then CoCoXY, then Neutral. But I'm not certain. Given the strict definitions, CoCoRes is the primary class, and the other two might not be applicable. However, the task requires three, so perhaps CoCoRes is first, then Neutral as second, and then CoCoGM as third. But this is speculative. Based on the example given in CoCoRes, the answer is CoCoRes first. The other two might be CoCoXY and Neutral, but I'm not sure. After careful consideration, the correct answer is CoCoRes as the primary class, then perhaps Neutral and then CoCoGM.
