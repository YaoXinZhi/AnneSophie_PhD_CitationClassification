Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. First, I need to look at the citation marked in the passage. The passage says, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." 

So, the context here is comparing the current study's results with those from another study mentioned in the citation. The key phrase is "substantially differ," which indicates a direct comparison of results. 

Next, I need to determine the general intent. Since the citation is being used to contrast findings, the intent falls under comparative. The specific rhetorical classes related to comparison are CoCoGM, CoCoRes, and CoCoXY. 

Looking at the examples provided, CoCoRes is when the citation compares results directly with the citing paper. The example given matches the structure of the current sentence, where results are contrasted. So CoCoRes is the primary class here. 

Then, I need to consider if there are other possible classes. The comparison here is between the current results and the cited results, not between two cited studies or methods. Therefore, CoCoRes is the most fitting. 

The next possible classes might be Basis if the citation was foundational, but that's not the case here. Support or Similar are out because the citation isn't supporting the current work or showing similarity. Neutral is unlikely since the comparison is explicit. 

So the top three would be CoCoRes as the primary, then maybe CoCoXY if there's a secondary comparison, but in this case, it's a direct comparison between the current work and the cited work. Wait, CoCoXY is for comparing two cited studies with each other, not with the current paper. So CoCoRes is the main one. 

The next classes could be Neutral if there's no strong intent beyond comparison. But since the comparison is explicit, Neutral might not fit. Alternatively, maybe Weakness if the cited work's results are being criticized, but the passage just states a difference without critique. 

Therefore, the top three classes are CoCoRes, then perhaps Neutral if there's no further intent, and maybe CoCoGM if there's a method comparison, but the context is about results. So the final ranking is CoCoRes first, then Neutral, then maybe CoCoXY if applicable. Wait, no, CoCoXY is between two cited studies. So the correct order is CoCoRes, then Neutral, then maybe another. Hmm, maybe the third could be Basis if the citation is foundational, but the example given for Basis is about introducing a method. Here, the citation is contrasting results, so Basis is not appropriate. 

So the top three are CoCoRes (since it's a direct result comparison), then maybe Neutral if the rest is just stating the difference without further intent. Alternatively, if there's a motivation to show differences, but the example for Motivation is about justifying research. Here, the citation is pointing out a difference, which could imply a motivation to address it, but the example doesn't show that. 

Therefore, the most accurate is CoCoRes as first, Neutral as second if there's no further intent, and maybe Support as third if the cited work is supporting, but it's actually contrasting. So Neutral might be the third. Wait, the example for Neutral is a descriptive citation without supporting or comparing. In this case, the citation is comparing, so Neutral might not be appropriate. Maybe Weakness if the cited work's results are being critiqued. But the passage just states a difference without critique. 

So the correct classes are CoCoRes, then maybe CoCoXY if there's another comparison, but no. So the top three are CoCoRes, then perhaps Neutral if the rest is just descriptive, and maybe CoCoGM if there's a method comparison. But the context is about results. So the final answer is CoCoRes first, then Neutral second, and maybe CoCoGM third. Wait, but the example for CoCoGM is comparing goals or methods. Since the current context is about results, CoCoRes is first. Then perhaps Neutral if there's no further intent. Alternatively, maybe Weakness if the cited work's results are problematic, but the passage doesn't state that. 

So the top three classes are CoCoRes, Neutral, and maybe Basis if the cited work is foundational. But the example for Basis is about introducing a method. Here, it's contrasting results, so Basis isn't right. 

Final answer: 1. CoCoRes, 2. Neutral, 3. CoCoGM.
