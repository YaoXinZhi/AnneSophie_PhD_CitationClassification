Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The citation is in the sentence: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@."

So the context is about comparing the current results with those from previous experiments using specific metal targets. The key phrase here is "substantially differ from the results," which indicates a direct comparison of results. Looking at the rhetorical classes, CoCoRes is for comparing results, which fits here. 

Next, the general intent seems to be contrasting findings, which falls under Comparative. The example given for CoCoRes matches this scenario where the current work's results are compared with cited experiments. 

Now, checking for other possible classes. There's no mention of future work or motivation here. The citation isn't supporting the current work but is pointing out a difference. So CoCoRes is primary. Could there be a secondary class? Maybe Neutral if it's just stating facts without support or criticism. But since it's a direct comparison, CoCoRes is first. The example in CoCoXY involves comparing two cited studies, which isn't the case here. So CoCoRes is the top class. 

The next possible could be CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two cited works, but in this case, the comparison is between the current work and the cited one. Wait, no, CoCoRes is when comparing cited work's results with the current paper's results. So CoCoRes is definitely first. 

Is there a secondary class? Maybe Neutral if it's just descriptive. But the example for Neutral is more like stating a fact without argument. Here, the comparison is direct, so Neutral might not fit. Alternatively, maybe CoCoRes is the only one. But the instructions ask for top three. Let me check again. 

The example given for CoCoRes is exactly this scenario where results are compared. So CoCoRes is first. The next could be CoCoGM if there's a method comparison, but the sentence mentions results. So maybe Neutral as the second. The third could be Basis if the cited work is foundational, but that's not the case here. So the top three would be CoCoRes, Neutral, Basis? Wait, the example for Neutral is when the citation is used descriptively. In this case, the citation is part of a comparison of results, so Neutral might not apply. Hmm. Maybe the second is CoCoXY if comparing two cited works, but here it's between current and cited. So perhaps the top three are CoCoRes, then maybe Neutral if the citation is just stating the results without further argument, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe CoCoRes is first, then CoCoGM if there's a method comparison, but the context is about results. Maybe Neutral is third. Let's go with CoCoRes as first, then Neutral if applicable, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe CoCoRes is the only one, but the instructions require three. Maybe the others are Neutral and Basis. But the context doesn't indicate Basis. Hmm. Let's stick with CoCoRes as first, then Neutral if there's no other, but I need three. Maybe CoCoRes, then CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two cited works, but here it's current vs cited. So perhaps CoCoRes is first, then Neutral, then Basis. But Basis is when the citation is foundational. Since the example given is CoCoRes, I think that's the primary. The second could be CoCoGM if methods are compared, but the context is results. Maybe Neutral is the second. Third could be Basis if the cited work is foundational, but again, not in this case. So maybe CoCoRes is first, then Neutral, then Basis. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe CoCoRes is first, then CoCoXY if comparing explanations, but the example for CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies. Here it's current vs cited, so CoCoRes is correct. Then perhaps Neutral is second, Basis third. I'll proceed with that.
