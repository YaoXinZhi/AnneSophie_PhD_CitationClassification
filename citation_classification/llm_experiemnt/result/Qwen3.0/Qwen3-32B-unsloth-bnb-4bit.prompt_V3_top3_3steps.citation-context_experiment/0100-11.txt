Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the citation marked @@CITATION@@. The passage says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." 

So the key part here is comparing the current results with those from another study. The general intent seems to be contrasting results. According to the definitions, if the citation is used to compare results directly with the citing paper's results, that's CoCoRes. 

Looking at the example for CoCoRes, it's exactly the same structure: comparing their results with cited results. The example given uses CoCoRes when results differ. So the primary class here is CoCoRes.

Next, are there other possible classes? The citation isn't comparing goals or methods, nor is it pointing out weaknesses or supporting. The context is straightforward comparison of results. There's no mention of conflicting explanations between two cited studies (CoCoXY), nor is it motivating future work. 

So the top three classes would be CoCoRes first. Then maybe Neutral if there's no other intent, but the comparison is direct. Wait, Neutral is when it's just descriptive without supporting or comparing. But here, the comparison is explicit, so Neutral might not fit. The next could be Basis if the cited work is foundational, but the example here is contrasting results, not establishing a basis. Maybe Future or Motivation? No, the context isn't about future work or motivation. 

So the top three are CoCoRes, then perhaps Neutral if there's no other intent, but I think CoCoRes is the only relevant one here. Wait, the example for Neutral mentions a descriptive use without supporting or comparing, but in this case, it's a direct comparison. So the second and third might be CoCoXY or something else. Wait, CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies with each other, not the citing paper. Here, the comparison is between the citing paper and the cited work. So CoCoRes is the primary. The next could be Basis if the cited work is foundational, but in this case, it's contrasting results. Maybe Neutral isn't applicable. Alternatively, maybe the second is CoCoGM if there's a method comparison, but the example here is about results. 

Hmm. Let me check the definitions again. CoCoRes is direct comparison of results between citing paper and cited work. The example given matches the user's case exactly. So CoCoRes is definitely first. The next two might be Basis or Neutral. But Basis is when the citation is foundational. Since the user is contrasting results, maybe the cited work isn't foundational here. So Neutral could be second if there's no other intent. Wait, Neutral is when it's descriptive without supporting, comparing, etc. But here it's a comparison. Maybe the second is Basis if the cited work provides some foundation, but the context is about differing results. So perhaps Neutral isn't applicable. Maybe the second and third are other classes. Alternatively, maybe Weakness if the cited work's results are being criticized, but the example says "substantially differ," which is a comparison, not criticism. So Weakness might not apply here. 

So the top three would be CoCoRes, then perhaps Neutral, then Basis? Wait, the example for Basis is introducing and validating a method. In this case, the cited work's results are being compared. So Basis isn't the right fit. Therefore, the top three are CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral as a fallback if no other classes apply. But Neutral is only when it's purely descriptive. Since the comparison is explicit, Neutral might not be the second. Maybe the next is CoCoGM or CoCoXY. But CoCoGM is about goals or methods, which isn't the case here. CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies, which isn't happening here. 

So the only applicable class here is CoCoRes. The user needs three classes, so perhaps the next two are Neutral and something else. But Neutral might not fit. Alternatively, maybe Weakness if the cited work's results are being contrasted as a weakness. But the example given in Weakness involves criticism, like "problematic" or "flawed." Here, it's just stating a difference. So Weakness might not be appropriate. 

In conclusion, the top three classes are CoCoRes as first, then Neutral if forced, but perhaps Neutral isn't the right fit. Wait, the example for Neutral is when it's just descriptive. In this case, the citation is being used to compare results, so Neutral isn't applicable. Therefore, maybe the next two are Basis and CoCoGM, but that's not matching the context. Hmm. Maybe the second is CoCoGM if the methods are different, but the example mentions results. 

I think the correct answer is CoCoRes as the primary, then perhaps Neutral as the second and third, but Neutral might not be correct. Wait, maybe the second is Basis if the cited work is foundational. But the cited work's results are being compared as differing, not establishing a basis. So perhaps the correct top three are CoCoRes, then maybe Motivation or Future, but the context doesn't suggest motivation or future work. 

This is tricky. Based on the example provided in CoCoRes, which matches the user's case exactly, the primary class is CoCoRes. The next two might be Neutral and something else. Since the example for Neutral is a descriptive citation without support or comparison, but here it's a comparison, maybe Neutral isn't applicable. Therefore, perhaps the top three are CoCoRes, then maybe CoCoXY, but that's comparing two cited studies. 

Wait, CoCoXY is when comparing two cited studies with each other, not with the citing paper. So the user's case is CoCoRes. The next two might be Basis or something else. If there's no other intent, maybe Neutral is forced. But Neutral is for descriptive citations without support, comparison, criticism, etc. Since the user is comparing results, Neutral isn't applicable. 

So the final answer is CoCoRes as first, then perhaps Basis and Neutral as second and third, even if they don't perfectly fit. But maybe Basis isn't correct here. Alternatively, maybe the second is CoCoGM. Hmm. I'm a bit stuck. Let me re-read the definitions. 

CoCoRes is when the citation is used to compare or contrast results. The example given in the user's case matches CoCoRes. So CoCoRes is definitely first. The second could be Basis if the cited work is foundational, but the context is about differing results. Neutral is when it's descriptive. Since the citation is being used to contrast results, Neutral isn't applicable. Therefore, the next two might be Basis and CoCoGM, but those don't fit. 

Given the constraints, the top three are CoCoRes, then maybe Neutral and Basis. But Neutral might not be correct. Alternatively, maybe Weakness isn't applicable. 

In conclusion, the correct answer is CoCoRes as first, then Neutral and Basis as second and third, even though Neutral might not be the best fit. But according to the instructions, we need three classes. So perhaps the final answer is:

1. CoCoRes  
2. Neutral  
3. Basis  
But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the second is CoCoXY. Wait, CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies. Since the user's citation is comparing their results with the cited work's, CoCoXY isn't applicable. Therefore, the correct answer is CoCoRes as first, then maybe Basis and Neutral as second and third.
