Okay, let's tackle this classification task step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the citation marked @@CITATION@@. The passage says, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." 

So, the citation here is being used to compare the results of the current study with those from a previous experiment using different metal targets. The key phrase is "substantially differ from the results," which indicates a direct comparison of findings. 

Looking at the general intent, this falls under the Comparative category. Now, checking the specific rhetorical classes under Comparative, CoCoRes is for comparing results. The example given in the CoCoRes definition matches this scenario exactly, where results are directly contrasted. 

Next, I need to see if there are other possible classes. The citation isn't comparing goals or methods (CoCoGM) or explanations between studies (CoCoXY). There's no mention of future work or motivation here either. The main point is contrasting results, so CoCoRes is the primary class. 

Could there be a secondary class? The Neutral class is for neutral descriptions, but here the citation is actively contrasting results, so Neutral isn't the best fit. Maybe CoCoXY if there were a comparison between two cited studies, but the example here only compares the cited work with the current study. 

Therefore, the top three classes would be CoCoRes as the primary, followed by perhaps Neutral if there's any descriptive aspect, but given the strong contrast in results, Neutral might not be the second. Wait, maybe the citation is also serving as a Basis for comparison, but since it's a direct result comparison, Basis is more about foundational work. 

Hmm, maybe the second could be CoCoXY if there's an indirect comparison, but the example in CoCoXY involves comparing two cited studies. Here it's the current work vs. cited work. So perhaps the second is Neutral. But the example given for Neutral is more about stating facts without argument. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a Basis here if the cited work is foundational, but the example for Basis is about introducing a method. In this case, the cited work's results are being contrasted, not foundational. So Basis isn't right. 

So the primary is CoCoRes. Then, perhaps Neutral as the second if the citation is just stating a fact without supporting or arguing, but the context is about differing results, which is a contrast. Alternatively, maybe Support isn't applicable here. 

Wait, the example for Support is about confirming findings, which isn't the case here. So the top three would be CoCoRes, then maybe CoCoXY if there's a comparison between studies, but no, CoCoXY is between two cited studies. 

So the top three are CoCoRes (1), then perhaps Neutral (2), and maybe Basis (3) if the cited work is foundational, but I don't think so. Alternatively, maybe Future or Motivation, but there's no indication of future work or motivation here. 

Therefore, the top three are CoCoRes, then Neutral, then maybe CoCoGM if there's a method comparison, but the cited work's methods aren't discussed here. The methods used in the cited work are mentioned (deuterium saturated metal targets), but the comparison is about results. So CoCoRes is the primary, Neutral as secondary if there's any descriptive aspect, but perhaps Weakness isn't applicable here. 

Wait, Weakness is for criticizing the cited work, which isn't happening here. So Neutral might not fit either. Maybe the second is Basis if the cited work is foundational, but again, the example for Basis is about introducing a method. 

This is tricky. Given the example provided for CoCoRes matches the scenario exactly, I'll stick with CoCoRes as the top. The second could be CoCoXY if there's a comparison between studies, but since it's current vs. cited, maybe Neutral is the second. Alternatively, maybe there's no second class applicable beyond CoCoRes. But the task requires three, so perhaps Neutral is forced as the second and third. 

Alternatively, maybe the second is CoCoGM if the methods are being compared. The cited work's methods involve different metal targets, but the current study's methods aren't mentioned here. So maybe CoCoGM isn't right. 

I think the correct top three are CoCoRes (1), Neutral (2), and CoCoGM (3) if there's any method comparison, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe Neutral isn't the right second class. Given the example in Neutral is about stating facts without argument, perhaps here the citation is being used to contrast results, so Neutral isn't the best fit. 

Wait, the Neutral example is "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@", which is a factual statement without argument. In our case, the citation is contrasting results, which is an argumentative point. So Neutral isn't appropriate. 

Therefore, maybe the second and third classes are CoCoXY and Basis. But CoCoXY requires comparing two cited studies. Since the example here only compares current work with one cited study, CoCoXY isn't applicable. Basis is about foundational work, which isn't the case here. 

Hmm, perhaps the top three are CoCoRes (1), then maybe CoCoGM (2) if methods are compared, but the methods aren't discussed here. The cited work's methods are mentioned (using deuterium saturated metal targets), but the current study's methods aren't. So CoCoGM isn't applicable. 

In conclusion, the primary rhetorical class is CoCoRes. The second and third might be Neutral and Basis, but Neutral doesn't fit. Maybe Weakness isn't applicable. Given the strict need for three, perhaps CoCoRes is the only one, but the task requires three. Maybe Neutral is forced here as the second and third. 

Alternatively, maybe the second is CoCoXY if the cited study is being compared with others, but the example doesn't mention other studies. 

I think I'll go with CoCoRes as the first, then maybe Neutral as the second and CoCoGM as the third, even if it's a stretch. But I'm not confident. The correct answer based on the example given is CoCoRes as the primary.
