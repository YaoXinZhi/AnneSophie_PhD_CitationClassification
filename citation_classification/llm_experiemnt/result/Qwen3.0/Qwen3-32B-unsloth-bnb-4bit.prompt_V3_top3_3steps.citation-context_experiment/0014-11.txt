Okay, let's tackle this classification task. First, I need to look at the context around the citation marked @@CITATION@@. The sentence says, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." 

Step 1 is to extract the relevant context. The key part here is comparing the results of the current work with those from the cited study. The phrase "substantially differ" indicates a direct comparison between the results.

Moving to Step 2, the general intent here seems to be comparative. The citation is used to highlight differences in results between the current study and the cited work. According to the definitions, this would fall under Comparative, which includes CoCoRes for comparing results.

In Step 3, the specific class should be CoCoRes since it's a direct comparison of results. Now, considering the other possible classes, maybe there's a mention of conflicting results, but the example given for CoCoXY involves comparing two cited studies with each other, not the citing paper. Here, the comparison is between the current work and the cited study, so CoCoRes is the primary class. 

Is there any other class that might apply? The example for CoCoXY mentions conflicting results between two cited studies, but in this case, the comparison is between the current work and the cited one. So CoCoRes is the top choice. 

Next, could there be a Neutral aspect? Neutral is when the citation is just descriptive without any specific argument. But here, the comparison is explicit, so Neutral is less likely. Support isn't fitting here either because it's not supporting the current work. 

So the top three classes would be CoCoRes as the primary, then maybe CoCoXY if there's a mention of conflicting results. Wait, the example for CoCoXY says comparing two cited studies. Here, the current work is compared with the cited study, so CoCoXY isn't applicable. The third might be Neutral if there's no further intent, but the main intent is clearly CoCoRes. Alternatively, maybe Future or Motivation, but the sentence isn't suggesting future work or motivating the research. 

Therefore, the top three are CoCoRes first, then perhaps Neutral if there's no other comparative intent, but since the example for Neutral is more descriptive without argument, maybe Neutral isn't the case here. Wait, the example given for Neutral is something like stating a fact without argument. In this case, the citation is directly comparing results, so Neutral isn't appropriate. 

So the top three should be CoCoRes as the primary, then maybe CoCoGM if there's a mention of goals or methods, but the sentence is about results. The example for CoCoRes is comparing results, so that's the main one. 

Therefore, the answer is CoCoRes first, then maybe CoCoXY if there's a mention of conflicting results between studies, but the example for CoCoXY involves comparing two cited studies. Here, it's the current work vs. cited, so CoCoRes is the only applicable. However, the example given for CoCoRes is similar to this case. 

Thus, the top three classes are CoCoRes, then perhaps Neutral if there's a descriptive element, but I don't think so. Maybe the next could be Support, but Support is when the citation supports the current work. Here, it's contrasting. So Neutral might be third. Wait, Neutral is when the citation is just descriptive without argument. In this case, the citation is being used to contrast results, which is an argumentative point, so Neutral isn't applicable. 

Hmm, perhaps the only applicable is CoCoRes. But the instructions say to list three. Maybe the example given for CoCoRes is the primary, then perhaps CoCoXY as a secondary if there's a mention of conflicting results between cited studies. Wait, the example for CoCoXY mentions conflicting results between two cited studies. In the given sentence, the current work's results differ from the cited study's. So CoCoXY isn't applicable here. 

Therefore, the top three would be CoCoRes as the primary, then maybe Basis if the cited work is foundational, but the example for Basis is about introducing a method. Here, the cited work is being compared in results, not foundational. 

So the answer is CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral as third if there's no other classes, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the next could be CoCoGM or CoCoXY, but they don't fit. 

Wait, the example for CoCoRes is exactly similar to the given sentence. The user's example says, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." Which matches the example given for CoCoRes. So the correct classification is CoCoRes as the primary. The next classes might be Neutral if there's a descriptive mention, but the sentence is clearly contrasting results, so Neutral isn't applicable. 

Therefore, the top three are CoCoRes, then maybe CoCoXY and Neutral, but they don't fit. Wait, maybe the user expects three classes even if only one is applicable. But according to the problem statement, I need to list three. Maybe the example given in the problem is CoCoRes as the primary, then perhaps CoCoXY if the cited work is part of a comparison between two studies. Wait, the example for CoCoXY says comparing two cited studies with each other. In the given sentence, it's comparing the current work with the cited study. So CoCoXY isn't applicable. 

Therefore, the correct answer is CoCoRes as the primary, then perhaps Neutral and Support as the next two, but they don't fit. Hmm. Maybe the user expects three classes even if only one is accurate. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the problem. 

The task says to assign three fined-grained rhetorical classes. The example given for CoCoRes is exactly matching the user's sentence. Therefore, CoCoRes is the primary. The next two could be CoCoXY and Neutral, but they don't fit. Alternatively, maybe the user expects three classes even if two are not applicable. But according to the instructions, I must list three. 

Wait, perhaps the citation is also being used to support the current work's findings by contrasting them. But Support is when the citation supports the citing authors. Here, the contrast is highlighting a difference, not supporting. So Support isn't applicable. 

Therefore, the only applicable class is CoCoRes, but the problem requires three. Maybe the example in the problem's instruction is CoCoRes as the primary, then perhaps CoCoXY and Neutral as the next two, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe there's another class. 

Wait, maybe the citation is also indicating that the results differ, which could imply a weakness in the cited work's results. But Weakness is when the citation criticizes the cited work. The sentence says the results differ substantially, which could indicate a problem, but the example for Weakness mentions problematic taxonomy. Here, it's just stating a difference, not necessarily a flaw. 

So Weakness isn't applicable. 

Therefore, the answer is CoCoRes as the primary, then maybe Neutral and Support as the next two, but they don't fit. This is confusing. Perhaps the user expects only CoCoRes and then Neutral and another class, but I'm not seeing it. Maybe the correct answer is CoCoRes first, then Neutral second, and then maybe CoCoXY third. 

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is CoCoRes, then CoCoXY, then Neutral. But I'm not confident. Given the example provided matches CoCoRes exactly, I'll go with CoCoRes as the primary, then Neutral and CoCoXY as the next two, even if they might not fit perfectly. 

Wait, the example for CoCoXY involves comparing two cited studies, not the current work and a cited study. So CoCoXY isn't applicable here. 

Therefore, the correct answer is CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral as second and Support as third, but they don't fit. 

Given the problem's instructions require three classes, and only CoCoRes is clearly applicable, perhaps the user expects the top three to be CoCoRes, then Neutral, then maybe Support. But I'm not sure. 

Given the example provided matches CoCoRes exactly, I'll proceed with CoCoRes as the primary, then Neutral and Support as the next two, even if they aren't the best fit. Alternatively, perhaps the user expects CoCoRes as the only correct class, but the instructions require three. 

In conclusion, based on the given example and the problem's instruction, the primary class is CoCoRes. The next two might be CoCoXY and Neutral, but I'm uncertain. However, given the example matches CoCoRes exactly, I'll proceed with CoCoRes as the first, then perhaps Neutral as the second and Support as the third.
