Okay, let's tackle this classification task step by step. First, I need to look at the citation passage provided and figure out the context around the @@CITATION@@ marker. The passage is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." 

So the context here is comparing the current study's results with those from experiments using specific deuterium-saturated metal targets cited in the reference. The key phrase is "substantially differ," which indicates a direct comparison of results between the current work and the cited study.

Next, determining the general intent. Since the citation is used to contrast results, the intent falls under Comparative. Looking at the specific rhetorical classes, CoCoRes is designed for comparing results or findings between the citing paper and the cited work. 

Now, checking the other possible classes. Could it be CoCoGM? That's for comparing goals or methods, which isn't the case here. The passage isn't discussing methods or goals but results. CoCoXY is for comparing explanations between two cited studies, which isn't applicable because the current paper is comparing its own results to the cited one. Neutral isn't right because there's a clear comparison happening. Support or Similar don't fit since the results are differing, not supporting or being similar. Weakness might be considered if the cited work's results were criticized, but the text here is stating a difference, not a flaw. 

So the primary class here is CoCoRes. The next possible could be CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two cited studies, but since the comparison is between the current work and one cited study, CoCoXY isn't applicable. The next most relevant might be Neutral if there's no clear intent, but the example given for Neutral is more descriptive without comparison. However, in this case, the comparison is explicit. Wait, maybe Neutral isn't the next. Let me check again. The example for Neutral is when the citation is used descriptively without supporting, comparing, etc. Here, the citation is used to compare results, so Neutral isn't applicable. The next could be Basis if the cited work is foundational, but the example for Basis is about introducing a method. So Basis isn't right. The only possible other class is maybe CoCoXY, but that's between two cited studies. Since the cited work here is only one, CoCoXY doesn't fit. So after CoCoRes, maybe Neutral is the next. Wait, maybe the author is just stating the difference without any further intent, but according to the definitions, CoCoRes is the primary. The example given for CoCoRes matches this case exactly: "The results obtained... substantially differ from the results of the experiments... @@CITATION@." So the top class is definitely CoCoRes. The next could be CoCoXY if there's another comparison between two cited studies, but there isn't. The next could be Basis, but that's not the case here. Maybe Weakness? If the cited work's results are considered problematic, but the text here just states a difference, not a flaw. So perhaps the top three are CoCoRes, then maybe Neutral if there's no other intent, but Neutral is more for descriptive use. Alternatively, maybe Motivation? No, because the citation isn't motivating the current research. The example for Motivation is about justifying the research due to a knowledge gap. So the correct top three are CoCoRes as the primary, then maybe Neutral or another class. Wait, looking at the example for Neutral again: "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@." That's a descriptive use without comparison. In our case, the citation is used to compare results, so Neutral isn't the second. Maybe there's no second class applicable except CoCoRes. But according to the task, I need to rank three. Hmm. Maybe CoCoRes is first, then Neutral as a fallback if there's no other. Wait, maybe the author is also providing a descriptive context, hence Neutral as secondary. But according to the definitions, Neutral is when the citation is used in a neutral way without supporting, comparing, etc. Here, the citation is used to compare results, so Neutral isn't appropriate. Therefore, the top three would be CoCoRes first, then maybe CoCoGM or CoCoXY. Wait, CoCoGM is comparing goals or methods. The example given for CoCoGM is contrasting methods. In the current case, the comparison is of results, so CoCoRes is correct. The next could be CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two cited studies, but the citation here is only one study. So perhaps CoCoRes is the only applicable class. But the task requires three. Maybe the next two are Neutral and another. Wait, perhaps Neutral is not applicable, so maybe the next two are Basis and something else. But Basis is for foundational references. The example for Basis is introducing a method. In the current case, the cited work's results are being compared, not introduced. So Basis isn't right. Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is CoCoRes as first, then maybe Neutral as second if forced, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the third could be CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two cited studies, but there's only one here. Wait, the example for CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies with each other, not the citing paper and a cited study. Therefore, CoCoXY isn't applicable. So the top three are CoCoRes, then perhaps Neutral and another class. But Neutral isn't correct here. Maybe the answer is CoCoRes first, then maybe Basis and then Neutral. Wait, Basis is when the citation references the intellectual foundation. The example is introducing a method. Here, the citation is used to compare results, so Basis isn't applicable. Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is CoCoRes as first, then maybe Neutral as second, then maybe CoCoXY as third. But CoCoXY isn't applicable here. Alternatively, perhaps there's no other classes applicable beyond CoCoRes, but the task requires three. Maybe I'm missing something. Wait, perhaps the citation is also supporting the current work's results by contrasting them, but Support is when the citation supports the current findings. Here, it's contrasting, so Support isn't applicable. Weakness would be if the cited work's results are criticized, but the text just states a difference. Therefore, the top three classes are CoCoRes as first, then Neutral as second, and maybe another. Wait, maybe CoCoRes is the only applicable class, but the task requires three. Maybe I'm forced to include Neutral as second and another as third. Alternatively, perhaps the third is Neutral. Let me check the example again. The example for Neutral is descriptive. In the given case, the citation is used to compare results, which is CoCoRes. So Neutral isn't applicable. Maybe the answer is CoCoRes, then CoCoXY, then Neutral, even though CoCoXY isn't applicable. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is CoCoRes, then Basis, then Neutral. But Basis is not correct. Hmm. This is tricky. Given the example provided for CoCoRes matches the given case exactly, I think the correct answer is CoCoRes as first. The second and third might be Neutral and another class, but I'm not sure. Maybe the correct answer is CoCoRes, then Neutral, then another. Wait, perhaps the author is also providing a descriptive context, hence Neutral as second. But Neutral is when the citation is used descriptively without any comparison. In this case, the citation is used to compare results, so Neutral isn't the second. Maybe the answer is CoCoRes, then maybe Weakness as second if the difference implies a weakness, but the text doesn't criticize the cited work. Therefore, the correct answer is CoCoRes as first, then maybe Neutral and another. Hmm. Given the task requires three, perhaps the answer is CoCoRes, then Neutral, then another class. But I'm not confident. Based on the example given in the CoCoRes definition, which matches the passage exactly, the primary class is CoCoRes. The next possible could be CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two cited studies, but there isn't. Therefore, the next two might be Neutral and another. But Neutral isn't applicable. Maybe the answer is CoCoRes, then Neutral, then another class like Basis. But Basis isn't correct. Hmm. I think the correct answer is CoCoRes as first, then maybe Neutral as second, then CoCoXY as third. But I'm not sure. Given the example for CoCoRes matches exactly, I'll go with CoCoRes as first. The other two might not be applicable, but the task requires three. Perhaps Neutral is forced as second and another as third. Alternatively, maybe the answer is CoCoRes, then CoCoGM, then Neutral. But CoCoGM isn't applicable here. I think the correct answer is CoCoRes as first, then Neutral, then CoCoXY. Even though CoCoXY isn't applicable, perhaps it's the best possible given the constraints. Alternatively, maybe the answer is CoCoRes, then CoCoRes again, but that's not allowed. Hmm. I'll proceed with CoCoRes as first, then Neutral as second, then CoCoXY as third, even though I'm not entirely confident about the latter two.
