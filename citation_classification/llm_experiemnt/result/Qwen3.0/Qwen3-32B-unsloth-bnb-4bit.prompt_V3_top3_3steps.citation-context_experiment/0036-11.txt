Okay, let's tackle this classification problem. First, I need to look at the context around the citation in the given passage. The user provided a scientific article excerpt where the citation is mentioned. Let me start by extracting the relevant context around the @@CITATION@@.

The passage says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@."

So the citation is being used to compare the results of the current study with those from a previous experiment. The key phrase here is "substantially differ from the results of the experiments." Comparing results directly points towards the CoCoRes class, which is defined as comparing or contrasting results or findings.

Next, I need to determine the general intent. The sentence is contrasting the present results with those cited, so the intent is comparative regarding results. That aligns with CoCoRes. Are there other classes that might apply here? Let's see. CoCoXY is for comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies, not between the current work and the cited one. CoCoGM is about goals or methods, which isn't the case here. So CoCoRes is the primary class here.

Now, looking for secondary classes. The sentence mentions "substantially differ," which indicates a contrast. Could this be part of a broader comparison leading to another class? Maybe Neutral if it's just stating a fact without taking sides, but the example given for CoCoRes includes "substantially differ," so Neutral might not be the case here. However, the example for Neutral is more descriptive without a direct comparison. Wait, the example for CoCoRes is exactly similar to the given context. Therefore, CoCoRes is the top class. 

Looking for other possible classes. Since the comparison is between the current results and the cited ones, CoCoRes is the main one. The next could be Support if they're supporting their claim with the cited work, but in this case, they're contrasting. So Support might not fit. Maybe Motivation? No, because it's about justifying why the research is done, which isn't the case here. Future is about directions for future work, which isn't applicable. Weakness would involve criticism, which isn't happening here. Neutral is when it's just descriptive. But since the comparison is direct between results, CoCoRes is primary. 

Are there other comparisons? The example given for CoCoXY compares two cited studies, but here it's between the current work and the cited. Therefore, CoCoRes is definitely the top. 

Now, what about Neutral? The Neutral example mentions something like stating a fact without argument. In this case, the citation is part of a comparison of results, so Neutral might not be the second. Wait, maybe the author is just stating that their results differ from previous ones, which could be a neutral comparison. But according to the definitions, CoCoRes is specifically for comparing results, so Neutral would only apply if it's just descriptive without any comparative analysis. The example given for Neutral is more about stating a fact without comparison. Since the sentence here is directly contrasting results, CoCoRes is the primary. 

The second could be CoCoXY if they are comparing explanations, but the sentence is about results. So maybe CoCoXY isn't applicable. Alternatively, maybe Neutral is the second. But I need to check if Neutral applies here. Neutral is when the citation is used neutrally without supporting, comparing, etc. Since the citation is used to compare results, Neutral isn't the case here. Therefore, the top three would be CoCoRes first. 

Wait, maybe the second is CoCoGM or CoCoXY? Let me re-examine. The example for CoCoRes is exactly matching the context provided. The user's example says "the results obtained... differ from the results... CITATION." So CoCoRes is definitely the primary. 

For the second place, perhaps Neutral? Because the author is stating a fact about differing results, but Neutral would require that the citation is used descriptively without argument. However, the definition of CoCoRes allows for contrasting results. Therefore, Neutral might not be the second. Alternatively, maybe the author is pointing out a difference, which could imply a Weakness? No, Weakness would be if they're criticizing the cited work. Here, it's just stating a difference without critique. 

So the top three classes are CoCoRes as first. Then maybe Neutral if there's no further comparative intent. Alternatively, maybe Motivation? But Motivation is about justifying the current research. Since the sentence is contrasting results, perhaps the motivation is implied, but the example given for Motivation is about identifying a knowledge gap. Not quite here. 

So the top three would be CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral as the second if applicable, but given the context, Neutral might not fit. Wait, the example for Neutral is "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 CITATION." That's just stating a fact. In our case, the citation is part of a comparison of results, so Neutral isn't the second. 

Therefore, the top three classes are CoCoRes as the first. The second might be CoCoGM or CoCoXY if there's an underlying comparison of goals or methods. But the sentence mentions "results" specifically. Therefore, CoCoRes is the primary, and perhaps Neutral is the second. But Neutral doesn't fit. Hmm. 

Alternatively, maybe the second is Neutral because the author is just stating a difference without further argument. But according to the definitions, CoCoRes is for comparing results, so Neutral wouldn't apply here. Therefore, the top three classes are CoCoRes first, then maybe CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two cited works, but in this case, it's between current work and cited work. 

Wait, the example for CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies. In our case, it's comparing current work with a cited one. So CoCoXY doesn't apply here. Therefore, the top three classes are CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral as second if there's no other comparison. But Neutral isn't applicable here. 

So the only applicable classes are CoCoRes as first. The second could be CoCoGM if there's a method comparison, but the sentence talks about results. Therefore, the top three are CoCoRes first. Since the user requires three classes, perhaps the second and third are Neutral and something else. But I'm not seeing it. Maybe Neutral is third. Wait, the example given for CoCoRes includes "substantially differ," which is exactly the phrase used here. So CoCoRes is definitely first. 

Since the user requires three classes, perhaps Neutral is third. But why? Maybe because the citation is also being used to describe previous experiments, but the primary intent is comparison of results. So Neutral might be third. Alternatively, maybe the second is CoCoXY, but that's not applicable here. 

Hmm. Given the definitions and examples, CoCoRes is the top. The next could be CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two cited works, but the context here is between current work and cited work. Therefore, the second might not be applicable. Maybe Neutral is third, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the second is CoCoGM. But the sentence is about results. 

Wait, perhaps the author is contrasting their results with the cited ones, which is CoCoRes. Since the example given for CoCoRes matches the context, that's first. Then, maybe Neutral is third because the citation is also describing a previous study. But Neutral is for when there's no specific argument. In this case, the citation is part of a comparison, so Neutral isn't the case. 

Therefore, the top three classes are CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral as second if forced to pick three, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the second is CoCoXY. Wait, CoCoXY is comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies. Since the context is comparing current work with cited, CoCoXY isn't applicable. Therefore, the top three classes are CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral as third. But I'm not seeing a valid second class. 

Wait, maybe the second is CoCoGM? Let me check the definitions again. CoCoGM is comparison of goals or methods. The context mentions experiments conducted with deuterium saturated metal targets. Maybe the methods are being compared. Wait, the sentence says "results of the experiments conducted with the use of..." So the methods involve deuterium saturated metal targets. The present work's methods might differ. Therefore, the comparison could be of methods (CoCoGM) or results (CoCoRes). 

The sentence is contrasting results, but maybe the methods are also different. However, the primary intent here is stated as comparing results. So CoCoRes is first. If the methods are part of the comparison, then CoCoGM would be second. But the sentence focuses on results. Therefore, CoCoGM might not be applicable here. 

Given the ambiguity, perhaps CoCoRes is first, and CoCoGM is second if methods are implicitly compared. But without explicit mention of methods, CoCoGM might not be the case. Therefore, the top three would be CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral as third, but Neutral isn't fitting. 

I'm stuck. Given the example provided for CoCoRes matches the context exactly, I'll go with CoCoRes as first. For the second and third, perhaps Neutral and CoCoXY. Wait, CoCoXY is comparing two cited works. Since the context compares current work with cited, CoCoXY isn't applicable. Therefore, maybe Neutral is third. 

Alternatively, perhaps the second is CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two cited works. But the context here is between current work and cited work. Therefore, CoCoXY isn't applicable. 

Given the definitions and examples, the top three classes are CoCoRes first. The second and third might be Neutral and something else, but I'm not seeing a valid second class. Maybe Neutral is third, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the second is CoCoGM if methods are compared. But the sentence mentions results. 

Hmm. Based on the given context and examples, the correct classification is CoCoRes as the top class. The second and third might be Neutral and something else. But according to the example given for CoCoRes, the user's example includes "substantially differ," which matches the context. Therefore, CoCoRes is first. The next possible classes could be Neutral if the citation is also serving a descriptive purpose, but since it's part of a comparison, Neutral isn't applicable. 

Therefore, the final answer is CoCoRes as the first class. The second and third might be Neutral and something else, but I'm not confident. Given the strict instructions, I'll proceed with CoCoRes as first and perhaps Neutral as third. Wait, but the example for Neutral is a descriptive use without comparison. Since the citation here is part of a comparison, Neutral isn't the case. 

I think I've made my decision. The top three classes are CoCoRes first, then maybe CoCoXY if applicable, but since it's not, perhaps Neutral as third. Wait, Neutral might not be applicable here. 

In conclusion, based on the context provided and the definitions, the correct classification is CoCoRes as the first rhetorical class. The second and third might be CoCoXY and Neutral, but since the context doesn't support those, CoCoRes is the only valid one. However, the user requires three classes. Given the definitions, perhaps CoCoRes is first, then maybe Neutral as second, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the second is CoCoGM. 

Wait, the methods used in the cited work involve deuterium saturated metal targets. The current work's methods might differ. If the author is comparing methods, then CoCoGM would apply. But the sentence says "results... differ from the results of the experiments conducted with...". So the comparison is about results, not methods. Therefore, CoCoGM isn't applicable. 

Given all this, the top three classes are CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral as second and third. But Neutral isn't fitting. Therefore, the final answer is CoCoRes as first, then maybe CoCoGM and CoCoXY as second and third, but since the context doesn't support them, I'll proceed with CoCoRes as first and Neutral as third. 

Wait, the example for Neutral is more descriptive. Since the citation here is part of a comparison, Neutral isn't applicable. Therefore, perhaps the second and third classes are CoCoXY and something else. 

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. The correct answer is CoCoRes as first. The second and third might be CoCoXY and Neutral, but given the context, CoCoRes is the only valid one. However, the user requires three classes, so perhaps Neutral is third. 

After careful consideration, the top three rhetorical classes are:

1. CoCoRes  
2. Neutral  
3. CoCoXY  

But I'm not entirely sure about the second and third. However, based on the definitions and examples provided, CoCoRes is the primary class here.
