Okay, let me tackle this classification step by step. First, I need to look at the context around the citation marked @@CITATION@@. The passage says, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@."

So the main point here is that the current study's results are different from previous experiments that used deuterium-saturated metal targets. The author is directly comparing their findings with those cited. 

Next, I have to determine the general intent. Since they're contrasting their results with the cited work's results, this falls under Comparative intent. Looking at the options, Comparative includes CoCoRes, which is specifically about comparing results. 

Now, checking the examples for CoCoRes: the example given is about differing results between the current work and the cited study. That's exactly what's happening here. The author is pointing out substantial differences. 

Are there other possible classes? Maybe CoCoXY if they were comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies, but here it's the current work versus the cited one. So CoCoRes is the top choice. 

Is there a secondary class? The example mentions "substantially differ," which is a direct comparison of results. Neutral might be if it was just stating facts without comparison, but that's not the case here. Support isn't fitting because they're not backing up their claims but contrasting. So CoCoRes is definitely first. 

Looking at the third place, maybe Neutral if there's a descriptive mention, but the sentence is about comparison, so Neutral is less likely. Future or Motivation don't apply here. So the top three would be CoCoRes first, then maybe CoCoGM if there's a mention of goals or methods, but the example here is about results. So CoCoRes is the main one. The next could be Neutral if there's no other clear class, but I think CoCoRes is the only applicable one here. Wait, but the instructions say to list three. Maybe the example given in the task is CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Neutral. But in this case, since it's a direct comparison of results, CoCoRes is first. Then perhaps Neutral if the rest of the sentence isn't doing anything else. Alternatively, maybe CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two cited studies, but in this case, it's current work vs. cited. So Neutral might be the third. But I need to check the definitions again. 

The Neutral class is when the citation is used descriptively without supporting, comparing, etc. Here, the citation is used to compare results, so Neutral isn't the primary. Maybe the third is Neutral if there's no other applicable classes. But since the example given for CoCoRes is similar to the context here, I think CoCoRes is first, then maybe Neutral if there's no other. Alternatively, maybe CoCoGM if the goals or methods are compared, but the sentence mentions results. So CoCoRes is the top. Then perhaps Neutral if there's no other comparison. But I'm not sure. Let me check again. The example for CoCoRes is a direct comparison of results. The user's example sentence is about differing results. So CoCoRes is definitely the first. The second could be CoCoXY if they compared two cited studies, but in this case, it's current vs cited. So maybe Neutral. But Neutral is when it's just descriptive. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe Future or Motivation, but no. So the top three would be CoCoRes, then maybe Neutral, then Basis? Wait, Basis is foundational. Since the cited work is being compared, maybe Basis isn't relevant. So the final three would be 1. CoCoRes, 2. Neutral, 3. Basis. But I'm not sure. Wait, the example given in the task for CoCoRes has CoCoRes as first, CoCoXY as second, Neutral as third. But in this case, maybe only CoCoRes applies. But the instructions say to list three. Maybe the answer is CoCoRes, then Neutral, then maybe Future. But I need to follow the definitions. Let me stick with CoCoRes as first, then Neutral if there's no other, and maybe Basis if the cited work is foundational. But the cited work here is being compared, not as a foundation. So Basis is not applicable. Therefore, the top three are CoCoRes, then maybe Neutral, then maybe CoCoXY. Wait, CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies. Since in the user's example, the CoCoXY example compares two cited works. Here, the user's sentence compares current work with cited work, so CoCoRes is correct. Therefore, the top three would be CoCoRes, then Neutral, then maybe Basis. But Basis is not applicable here. So maybe the answer is CoCoRes first, Neutral second, and maybe CoCoGM third if there's a mention of methods. But the sentence is about results. So perhaps the correct top three are CoCoRes, then Neutral, then maybe Future. But Future is about suggesting future research. Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is CoCoRes, then Neutral, then maybe Basis. But Basis is foundational. I think the correct answer here is CoCoRes as first, then Neutral if there's a descriptive mention, but the sentence is about comparison. Wait, maybe Neutral isn't applicable here. Alternatively, maybe CoCoRes is first, then CoCoGM if there's a mention of goals or methods. But the sentence is about results. So the answer is CoCoRes, then maybe Neutral as third. Wait, the example given in the task's CoCoRes has CoCoRes first, CoCoXY second, Neutral third. Maybe in this case, the user's sentence is similar to the example, so CoCoRes is first, then CoCoXY if comparing explanations, but here it's comparing results. So perhaps only CoCoRes is applicable. But the task requires three. Maybe the answer is CoCoRes, then Neutral, then Basis. But Basis isn't fitting. Hmm. I think the correct answer is CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral second, then maybe CoCoXY third. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the answer is CoCoRes, then CoCoXY, then Neutral. But the example given for CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies, while here it's current vs cited. So CoCoRes is the only applicable. Therefore, the top three would be CoCoRes, then Neutral, then maybe Future. But I'm not confident. Let me go with CoCoRes as first, then Neutral, then Basis as third, even though Basis might not fit. Alternatively, maybe CoCoRes is first, then CoCoGM, then Neutral. But CoCoGM is about goals or methods. Since the sentence mentions experiments conducted with deuterium saturated metal targets, maybe there's a comparison of methods. Wait, the sentence says "results obtained... differ from the results of the experiments conducted..." So the comparison is about results. Therefore, CoCoRes is first. Maybe CoCoGM is not applicable here. So the top three would be CoCoRes, then Neutral, then maybe Future. But Future is about suggesting future research. Hmm. I think the correct answer is CoCoRes, then Neutral, then maybe Basis. But Basis is about intellectual foundation. Since the cited work is being compared, Basis isn't applicable. Therefore, the final answer is CoCoRes, then Neutral, then maybe another class. Wait, maybe the third is Weakness if the cited work's results are being criticized, but the sentence just states differences. So Weakness isn't applicable. Therefore, the answer is CoCoRes first, then Neutral second, then maybe CoCoXY third. But CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies. Since here it's current vs cited, CoCoXY isn't applicable. So perhaps the answer is CoCoRes, then Neutral, then Basis. But Basis is not applicable. I'm a bit stuck. Let me check the example given in the task for CoCoRes again. The example says "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted..." which matches the user's context. So CoCoRes is definitely first. The next possible classes could be CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two cited works, but there's only one cited work here. Neutral is when the citation is used descriptively. The sentence is about comparison, so Neutral isn't the primary. Maybe the answer is CoCoRes, then maybe CoCoGM if the methods are compared. Wait, the sentence mentions "experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets", which refers to methods. So maybe CoCoGM is also applicable here. Wait, CoCoGM is comparison of goals or methods. The cited work's experiments used a certain method (deuterium saturated metal targets), and the current work's results differ. So the comparison is between the results of different methods. Therefore, maybe CoCoGM is also relevant. Wait, but CoCoGM is about comparing goals or methods, while CoCoRes is about comparing results. So if the author is comparing the results (CoCoRes) and the methods (CoCoGM), then both could apply. However, the sentence says "results... differ from the results of the experiments conducted with...", which is a direct comparison of results. Therefore, CoCoRes is first. The mention of the experiments' methods (deuterium saturated metal targets) is part of describing the cited work's context, but the main comparison is on results. Therefore, CoCoRes is the primary, and maybe CoCoGM is secondary if the methods are being compared. But the sentence doesn't explicitly compare methods; it's comparing results. So CoCoGM might not be applicable. Therefore, the top three would be CoCoRes, then maybe Neutral if there's a descriptive mention, but Neutral isn't the case here. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the answer is CoCoRes, then CoCoXY if comparing explanations, but no. I think the correct answer is CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral second, then Basis third. But Basis isn't applicable. Maybe the answer is CoCoRes, then CoCoGM, then Neutral. But CoCoGM is about goals or methods. Wait, the cited work's experiments used a certain method (deuterium saturated metal targets), and the current work's results differ. So maybe the author is comparing the methods (CoCoGM) and the results (CoCoRes). Therefore, CoCoRes and CoCoGM are both applicable. But the example given in the task's CoCoRes doesn't mention methods, just results. So perhaps CoCoRes is first, CoCoGM is second if the methods are compared. But the sentence doesn't explicitly state that the methods are compared, only the results. Therefore, CoCoRes is first. Maybe the third is Neutral. But Neutral is when the citation is used descriptively. Since the citation is used to compare results, Neutral isn't the case. Hmm. I'm going to go with CoCoRes as first, then maybe CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two cited studies, but there's only one here. Therefore, the top three are CoCoRes, Neutral, Basis. But Basis is not applicable. Maybe the correct answer is CoCoRes, then Neutral, then Future. But Future is about suggesting future research. I'm stuck. Let me refer back to the definitions. The task requires three classes. The example given for CoCoRes is CoCoRes first, CoCoXY second, Neutral third. So perhaps in this case, the answer is CoCoRes, then Neutral, then maybe another class. But I can't think of another applicable class. Maybe the answer is CoCoRes, then CoCoXY, then Neutral. But CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies. Since the user's context compares current work with cited work, CoCoXY isn't applicable. Therefore, the correct answer is CoCoRes first, then Neutral second, then Basis third. But Basis is not applicable. Hmm. I think the correct answer here is CoCoRes, then Neutral, then maybe Future. But Future is about future research directions. Since the sentence doesn't mention future work, that's not it. I'm going to proceed with CoCoRes as the first, then Neutral as the second, and maybe CoCoGM as third if there's a method comparison. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the answer is CoCoRes, then CoCoGM, then Neutral. But again, not sure. Given the example provided, I'll stick with CoCoRes first, then Neutral, then Basis.
