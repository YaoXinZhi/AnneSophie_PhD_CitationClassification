Okay, let me try to figure out the correct rhetorical classes for the given citation. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage says, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." The citation here is used to compare the results of the current study with those from a previous experiment using different metal targets.

Next, determining the general intent. The key phrase is "substantially differ," which indicates a direct comparison of results between the current work and the cited study. That points towards a comparative intent, specifically comparing findings or outcomes.

Now, looking at the specific classes, CoCoRes is for comparing results, which fits perfectly here. The example given in the instructions for CoCoRes is almost identical to this case. 

Are there other possible classes? Maybe Neutral if it's just stating facts without comparison, but the wording here is clearly contrasting results. CoCoGM or CoCoXY don't fit because it's about results, not goals/methods or explanations between studies. 

So the top class is definitely CoCoRes. For the second and third, maybe Neutral if there's no other intent, but the example for Neutral is more about stating a fact without comparison. Since the citation is directly contrasting results, CoCoRes is the main one. The next possible could be Basis if the cited work is foundational, but the context here is about differing results, not establishing a foundation. Motivation or Future might not apply here. 

So the top three would be CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral if there's no other intent, but I think CoCoRes is the only strong one here. Wait, the example for CoCoRes is similar, so maybe Neutral isn't needed. Hmm, perhaps Neutral is a lower-ranked possibility if the citation is just mentioned without any strong comparison. But the example given in the instructions for CoCoRes uses similar wording. So I'll stick with CoCoRes as the top, then maybe Neutral or Basis. Wait, Basis is when the citation is foundational. Since the cited work's results are being compared, maybe Basis isn't right. So the top three would be CoCoRes, then maybe Neutral and then Basis? Wait, no. Let me check again. 

The example for CoCoRes says "substantially differ from the results of... @@CITATION@." So that's a direct comparison of results. So CoCoRes is definitely first. The next could be CoCoXY if comparing explanations between two studies, but in this case, it's comparing the current study's results with the cited study's, not two cited studies. So CoCoXY isn't right. Then maybe Neutral? If there's no other intent. But the citation is being used to highlight a difference, which is a form of comparison, so Neutral might not fit. Alternatively, maybe Weakness if the cited work's results are being criticized, but the passage doesn't say the cited work is flawed, just that results differ. So Weakness isn't right. 

Therefore, the top three are CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral and Basis. Wait, Basis is foundational. Since the cited work is being compared in results, perhaps Basis isn't appropriate. Unless the cited work is the basis for the current study's comparison. But the example for Basis is about introducing a method, not comparing results. So Basis isn't the right class here. 

So the top three would be CoCoRes first, then Neutral, then maybe Support or Similar. Wait, Support is when the citation supports the current work. Here, the citation is contrasting results, so Support isn't right. Similar is when results are similar. The passage says "substantially differ," so Similar isn't right. 

Therefore, the correct top three are CoCoRes first, then Neutral, then maybe CoCoGM. Wait, CoCoGM is comparing goals or methods. The passage is comparing results, not goals or methods. So CoCoGM isn't right. 

So the only valid classes here are CoCoRes first, then Neutral, then maybe Future or Motivation. But there's no indication of future work or motivation here. 

Wait, maybe the citation is just being used to state that there are differing results, which could be Neutral. But Neutral is when the citation is used descriptively without argument. However, in this case, the comparison is part of the argument that the current results differ. So CoCoRes is the main class, Neutral might not apply. Hmm. 

I'm a bit confused here. Let me recheck the definitions. CoCoRes is for direct comparison of results. Neutral is when it's descriptive without supporting, comparing, etc. Since the citation is used to compare results, CoCoRes is the primary class. The example given in the instructions is almost identical. Therefore, CoCoRes is the top. The other two would be Neutral and maybe Basis. But Basis is when the citation is foundational. Since the cited work's results are being contrasted, Basis isn't appropriate. 

Therefore, the top three classes are CoCoRes, then maybe Neutral, then Basis. Wait, but Basis is not fitting here. Maybe Neutral is the second? But Neutral would require the citation to be neutral. Since the citation is being used to contrast results, Neutral isn't the right class. So perhaps CoCoRes is the only valid class here, but the task asks for top three. Hmm. Maybe the other two are Neutral and CoCoXY. But CoCoXY is comparing explanations between two studies, which isn't the case here. 

I think the correct answer is CoCoRes as the first, then maybe Neutral and then Basis, even though Basis isn't perfect. Alternatively, maybe Neutral isn't appropriate. Wait, Neutral example is stating a fact without argument. Here, the citation is part of an argument about differing results, so Neutral isn't right. 

In that case, maybe the only correct class is CoCoRes, but the task requires three. Since the example in CoCoRes has the same structure, maybe CoCoRes is first, then Neutral (if possible), then Basis. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is CoCoRes, then Basis, then Neutral. But I'm not confident. 

Wait, the Basis example is about introducing a method. Here, the cited work's results are being compared, not introducing a method. So Basis isn't right. 

Therefore, the top three are CoCoRes, then maybe CoCoXY and Neutral. But CoCoXY isn't applicable. 

Hmm. Maybe the answer is CoCoRes, then Neutral, then maybe Support. But Support isn't right here. 

I think the correct answer is CoCoRes as the first class, then Neutral and Basis as the next two, even though Basis isn't perfect. Alternatively, maybe Neutral isn't right. 

This is tricky. Given the example provided in the instructions for CoCoRes matches the passage, I'll go with CoCoRes as the first class. The other two might be Neutral and Basis, but I'm not certain. Wait, maybe the citation is used to highlight a difference, which is a form of comparison, so CoCoRes is the only valid class here. The task requires three, but perhaps the other two are Neutral and CoCoGM. 

But given the passage doesn't mention goals or methods, CoCoGM isn't applicable. Therefore, the answer should be CoCoRes first, then Neutral, then Basis. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe Neutral isn't right. 

After re-reading, I think the correct answer is CoCoRes first. The other two might be Basis and Neutral, but I'll proceed with CoCoRes as the top class and the other two as Neutral and Basis, even if Basis isn't the best fit.
