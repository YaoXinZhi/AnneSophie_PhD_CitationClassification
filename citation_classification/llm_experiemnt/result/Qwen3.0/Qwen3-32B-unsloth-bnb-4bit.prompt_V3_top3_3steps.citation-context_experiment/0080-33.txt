Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the task is to determine the top three rhetorical classes for the given citation in the scientific passage. First, I need to look at the context around the citation. 

The passage mentions that the current research compared the results of their experiments with those conducted using deuterium saturated metal targets, and they reference the citation here. The example given for CoCoRes is about comparing results of the cited work with the current paper's results. That seems similar because the example sentence directly contrasts their results with the cited experiments.

So step one is extracting the context. The relevant part is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@".

Next, identifying the general intent. The citation here is being used to compare results. The words "substantially differ" indicate a direct comparison of findings between the current work and the cited study. That points towards CoCoRes as the primary class. 

Looking at other possible classes: Is there a comparison of goals or methods? The example for CoCoGM involves comparing methods or goals, but in this case, the focus is on results, not methods or objectives. So CoCoGM is less likely. 

Is there a mention of similar findings? The example for Similar points out a similarity, but here it's a difference, so Similar isn't applicable. 

Could it be Support? The Support class is when the citation backs up the current work's findings. However, here they're contrasting results, not supporting. 

Neutral would be if it's just a factual mention without any comparison or support. But since they're explicitly stating a difference, Neutral is not the case. 

Weakness or Criticism? The citation isn't being used to point out flaws in the cited work, just that the results differ. So Weakness is probably not right. 

Future or Motivation? No indication of future work or why the current research is done here. 

So the primary class is CoCoRes. Now, what about secondary classes? The example for CoCoXY involves comparing two cited studies with each other, not the current paper. The current context is comparing the current work with the cited study, so CoCoXY isn't applicable here. 

What about Basis? Basis is foundational, but this is a comparison of results, not establishing a foundation. 

So the top three would be CoCoRes as first. Then, maybe Neutral? Wait, Neutral is when it's just descriptive. But the example given for Neutral is more about stating facts without argument. In this case, the citation is part of a comparison, so Neutral might not fit. However, if there's no further analysis, maybe Neutral is secondary. Alternatively, maybe there's a Basis here. Wait, Basis is when the citation is the foundation. Since this is comparing results, not establishing a basis, Basis is not applicable. 

Wait, maybe there's another class. Let me check again. The example for CoCoRes is exactly matching the structure here. The citation is used to compare results directly. So CoCoRes is definitely first. 

What about CoCoGM? The example for CoCoGM is comparing goals or methods. The current context mentions experiments conducted with deuterium targets, but the comparison is on results. So CoCoGM is not applicable here. 

Is there any other possible class? Maybe Future or Motivation? No, the citation is not suggesting future work. 

So the top three are CoCoRes as first. Then maybe Neutral? Or perhaps there's another comparison. Wait, maybe CoCoXY? But CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies with each other, not the current paper. The example given for CoCoXY mentions conflicting results between two cited studies. In the current context, it's comparing the current work's results with a cited study. So CoCoXY doesn't fit here. 

So the only applicable class is CoCoRes. But the task asks for the top three. Maybe Neutral is the second? Let me think again. Neutral is when the citation is used in a neutral way. In the example given for Neutral, it's just stating a fact. Here, the citation is part of a comparison of results, so Neutral might not be appropriate. Unless the comparison is just stating a difference without any further argument. 

Alternatively, maybe Support is considered. But Support is when the citation supports the current work's findings. Here, the results are different, so Support isn't applicable. 

Hmm. Maybe the top three are CoCoRes, then Neutral, then maybe Basis? Wait, Basis is when the citation is foundational. The example for Basis is introducing a method. Here, the citation is about comparing results, so Basis isn't right. 

Wait, maybe Neutral is the second. Let's see. If the citation is just stating that their results differ, but the way it's phrased is neutral in describing the comparison. Maybe Neutral is the second class. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the second class is CoCoRes again, but that's not possible. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a Basis if the cited work is foundational for the comparison. But the example for Basis is when the cited work introduced a method. Here, the cited work's results are being compared, so Basis isn't applicable. 

So perhaps the top three are CoCoRes, Neutral, and maybe CoCoGM? Wait, no. 

Wait, perhaps the answer is CoCoRes first, then maybe Weakness? But the citation isn't criticizing the cited work. It's just stating that the results are different. So Weakness is not applicable. 

Hmm. Maybe the answer is CoCoRes as first, then Neutral as second, and maybe Basis as third. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, maybe Neutral isn't applicable here. 

Wait, let me re-examine the example for Neutral. The example is "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@" â€“ this is just a factual statement. In the current context, the citation is used to state that their results differ from experiments conducted with deuterium targets. That's a direct comparison of results, so CoCoRes is first. The other possible classes might be Neutral if there's no further analysis, but in this case, the comparison is explicit. 

Wait, maybe there's another angle. Since the citation is part of a comparison of results, maybe CoCoRes is first, and then maybe CoCoGM or CoCoXY as secondary? No, because the comparison is between the current work and the cited study's results. 

I think the correct top three here is CoCoRes as first, and perhaps Neutral as second if there's a neutral description. Alternatively, maybe Neutral isn't applicable. Maybe the second is nothing else, so perhaps Neutral is forced as third. 

But according to the instructions, I need to list three classes even if some are not strongly applicable. So perhaps CoCoRes is first, then maybe Basis, then Neutral. But Basis doesn't fit. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is CoCoRes, then maybe CoCoXY? Wait, CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies. The example mentions conflicting results between two cited works. In the current context, the citation is comparing the current work's results with a cited study. So CoCoXY is not applicable here. 

So the only possible class is CoCoRes as first. For the second and third, perhaps Neutral and Basis, but neither seems right. Maybe Neutral is second because the citation is used to state a fact (that experiments were conducted with deuterium targets), but the main intent is the comparison of results. 

Alternatively, maybe the second class is Support. Wait, Support is when the citation supports the current findings. Here, the results are different, so Support isn't applicable. 

Hmm. Maybe the answer is CoCoRes as first, Neutral as second, and maybe Basis as third. But I'm not sure. Let me go back to the example given for CoCoRes. The example is exactly matching the structure here. So CoCoRes is definitely first. 

For the second and third, perhaps there are no other applicable classes. But according to the task, I need to list three. Maybe Neutral is the second, and maybe Weakness is third? But Weakness doesn't fit. 

Alternatively, maybe there's no other classes applicable, so Neutral and Basis are forced. But I'm not confident. 

Given the example, the correct answer is CoCoRes as first. The second could be Neutral if the citation is just stating the existence of the experiments, but the main intent is the comparison. Alternatively, maybe there's no second class. But the task requires three. 

I think the answer is CoCoRes, then maybe Neutral, then maybe Basis. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe Neutral is not applicable here. 

Wait, perhaps the citation is used to compare results, so CoCoRes is first. Then, maybe the context is also using the citation to establish the basis for the comparison, which could be Basis. But Basis is when the cited work is foundational. 

Alternatively, maybe the citation is used to support the claim that their results differ, so Support? But Support is when the cited work supports the current findings. Here, the cited work's results are different, so Support isn't applicable. 

Hmm. Given the strict definitions, I think the correct answer is CoCoRes as first, and the other two classes might not be applicable. But since the task requires three, maybe Neutral is second and Basis third. 

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is CoCoRes, Neutral, and then maybe CoCoGM. But that doesn't fit. 

I think the best I can do here is CoCoRes as first, then Neutral as second, and maybe Basis as third. But I'm not confident about the latter two. However, given the example provided in the task, the primary class is CoCoRes.
