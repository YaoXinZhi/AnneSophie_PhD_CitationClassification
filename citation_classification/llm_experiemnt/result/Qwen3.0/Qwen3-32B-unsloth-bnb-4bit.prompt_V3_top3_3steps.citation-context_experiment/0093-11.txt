Okay, let's start by looking at the given passage. The citation is mentioned in the sentence: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The key part here is that the authors are comparing their results with those from previous experiments. The phrase "substantially differ" indicates a direct comparison of findings between the current study and the cited work.

Next, determining the general intent. Since the sentence is contrasting results, this points towards a comparative intent. The predefined classes related to comparison are CoCoGM, CoCoRes, and CoCoXY. 

Looking at the examples, CoCoRes is used when comparing results directly. The example given is similar to the current case where results are compared. The other options like CoCoGM involve methods or goals, which isn't the focus here. CoCoXY compares two cited studies, which isn't the case here either. 

So the primary class here is CoCoRes. Then, considering secondary classes, maybe Neutral if there's no strong support or criticism, but since there's a direct comparison, Neutral might not be the best. However, the example for CoCoRes fits well. The next possible could be Basis if the cited work is foundational, but the context is about differing results, not establishing a foundation. Maybe Future if suggesting further research, but the sentence is about existing results. 

Wait, the example for CoCoRes uses phrases like "substantially differ," which matches the current sentence. Therefore, CoCoRes is the top class. The next could be Neutral if there's no other intent, but since the comparison is direct, perhaps CoCoXY isn't applicable here. Alternatively, maybe Support if they are contrasting to support their own findings. But the example for Support involves confirming results, not contrasting. 

So the top three would be CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral as the comparison is direct but not necessarily supporting or motivating. Alternatively, maybe Weakness if they are pointing out flaws, but the sentence doesn't criticize the cited work, just states differences. Therefore, Weakness isn't appropriate. 

Thus, the top three classes are CoCoRes (1), then perhaps Neutral (2), and maybe Similar (3) if there's a similarity mentioned, but the example here is about differences. Wait, Similar is for pointing out similarities. Since this is a difference, Similar isn't right. Maybe Future isn't applicable either. 

So the final ranking would be CoCoRes first, then Neutral as the context is descriptive but comparative. Alternatively, maybe CoCoXY isn't relevant here. Wait, CoCoXY is when comparing two cited studies, not the current with a cited one. Therefore, CoCoRes is the primary, Neutral if there's no other intent, but maybe there's another. Hmm. Let me check the definitions again. 

CoCoRes is comparing the citing paper's results with the cited work's results. The example given matches this. Therefore, CoCoRes is definitely first. The second could be Neutral if there's no further intent. The sentence is just stating a difference without supporting or motivating. But maybe there's a Motivation to do further research because of the differences. Wait, the example for Motivation uses phrases like "justify why the current research is being conducted," but in this case, the sentence is about differing results, not motivating the current study. 

So Neutral might be the second class if the citation is just stating a fact without further argument. The third could be Basis if the cited work is foundational, but it's about differing results. Alternatively, maybe Future isn't applicable. 

So the final ranking would be CoCoRes (1), Neutral (2), and maybe Basis (3) if the cited work is part of the foundation. Wait, the example for Basis involves introducing a method. Here, the cited work's results are being compared, not introducing a method. So Basis is less likely. 

Therefore, the top three are CoCoRes, then Neutral, and perhaps Similar isn't applicable here. Wait, Similar is for pointing out similarities. Since this is a difference, maybe Weakness isn't right either. 

So the top three are CoCoRes (1), Neutral (2), and maybe Future (3) if the differences suggest future research, but the example for Future is about suggesting directions. Since the current sentence doesn't mention future work, Future might not be right. 

Hmm, maybe the third is Basis, but that's not fitting. Alternatively, maybe the third is Support, but Support is for confirming results. 

I think the correct ranking is CoCoRes as the primary, then Neutral as the context is descriptive, and maybe Similar is not applicable. Wait, Neutral is when the citation is used neutrally without supporting or comparing. In this case, the citation is used to compare results, so Neutral might not be correct. Wait, the example for Neutral is when it's descriptive without argument. 

Wait, the example for CoCoRes is "substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted... @@CITATION@@", which matches the given sentence. Therefore, CoCoRes is definitely first. 

For the second and third, maybe Neutral isn't appropriate. Let me check the definitions again. Neutral is when the citation is used in a neutral way without supporting, comparing, etc. In this case, the citation is used to compare results, so it's CoCoRes. Therefore, maybe there are no other classes applicable. But the task requires three. Hmm. 

Wait, maybe there's another intent. If the authors are contrasting their results with previous ones to show a new finding, maybe that's part of supporting their own work. But the Support class is when the citation confirms the citing authors' work. In this case, they're stating differences, so Support isn't applicable. 

Alternatively, maybe the citation is part of the foundation (Basis), but Basis is for introducing methods or foundational work. Since this is comparing results, Basis isn't the right class. 

Hmm, perhaps the top three are CoCoRes, then maybe Motivation (if the differences motivate their current work), but the example for Motivation uses phrases like "justify why the current research is being conducted." In the given sentence, the authors are stating differences but not necessarily motivating their current study. 

Alternatively, maybe Future isn't applicable. 

This is tricky. Maybe the correct answer is CoCoRes as the primary, then Neutral as the second, and maybe Basis as the third if the cited work is part of the foundation. But the cited work here is being compared, not as a foundation. 

Wait, the example for Basis is when the cited work introduced a method. Here, the cited work's results are being compared. So Basis is not applicable. 

Therefore, the top three classes are CoCoRes (1), then maybe Neutral (2), and perhaps Similar (3) is not applicable. 

But the task requires three classes. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. 

The sentence is comparing results, so CoCoRes is definitely first. Then, maybe there's a secondary intent. Since the authors are contrasting their results with previous ones, maybe this is part of their argument to show novelty, which could be part of Motivation (if the previous results motivate their study) or Future. But the example for Motivation is about justifying the current research. 

Alternatively, maybe the citation is used to support their claim of differing results. Wait, Support is when the citation confirms the citing authors' work. In this case, the citation supports the statement that their results differ from previous ones, but the cited work's results are the ones being compared. So maybe Support isn't applicable here. 

Hmm. Given the definitions, the only applicable class is CoCoRes. But the task requires three classes. Maybe the second is Neutral because the citation is used in a neutral comparative way, and the third could be Basis if the cited work is foundational. But that's a stretch. 

Alternatively, maybe the third class is Similar if there's any similarity mentioned. But the example here is about differences. 

I think the correct answer is CoCoRes as the primary, then maybe Neutral as the second (since the citation is used to state a fact without further argument), and perhaps Basis as the third if the cited work is part of the foundation. But I'm not sure. Given the example provided in the task, the answer would be CoCoRes first. The other two might be Neutral and something else, but I'm not certain. Maybe Neutral is the second and Future is the third if the differences suggest future work. 

But the example for Future is about suggesting directions. Since the given sentence doesn't mention future work, Future isn't applicable. 

In conclusion, the top three classes are CoCoRes (1), Neutral (2), and Basis (3), even though Basis might not fit perfectly. Alternatively, maybe the third is another class. Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is CoCoRes (1), then maybe CoCoXY isn't applicable. 

Wait, CoCoXY is when comparing two cited studies. Here, it's comparing the current study with a cited one. Therefore, CoCoXY isn't applicable. 

So the final answer is CoCoRes as the primary, then maybe Neutral as the second, and perhaps another class. But I'm stuck. Given the definitions, I'll go with CoCoRes first, then Neutral second, and maybe Basis third if forced to pick three.
