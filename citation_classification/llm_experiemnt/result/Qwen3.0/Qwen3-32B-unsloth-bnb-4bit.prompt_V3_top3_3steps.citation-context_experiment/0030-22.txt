Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage says, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." So the key part here is comparing their results to those from previous experiments mentioned in the citation.

Next, identifying the general intent. The phrase "substantially differ" indicates a comparison of results between the current study and the cited work. That points towards the Comparative category, specifically CoCoRes since it's about comparing findings.

Now, ranking the rhetorical classes. The primary class here is definitely CoCoRes because the citation is directly contrasting results. Then, maybe CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two studies, but in this case, it's the current work versus the cited one, not two cited studies. So CoCoXY might not apply. The next possible could be Neutral if there's no strong intent beyond comparison, but since the comparison is explicit, Neutral might not fit. Maybe Support if they're using the citation to back up their claim, but the wording here is about differing results, which is more of a contrast than support. So the top three would be CoCoRes first, then perhaps CoCoGM if they're comparing methods or goals, but the example given in CoCoRes fits better. Wait, the example for CoCoRes is similar to this case. So the top class is CoCoRes. Then, maybe Neutral if there's no further intent, but the example for Neutral is more descriptive. Alternatively, maybe Weakness if they're pointing out a flaw, but here it's about differing results, not criticizing. So the top three would be CoCoRes, then maybe CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two cited studies, but the example here is between current and cited. So perhaps Neutral as the third, but the example for Neutral is more like stating a fact without argument. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe Motivation isn't right here. Let me check the example again. The example for CoCoRes is comparing results of present work with cited experiments. So the correct classes here are CoCoRes as primary. The second might be CoCoGM if they're comparing methods, but the text mentions results. So maybe Neutral as the third if there's no other intent. Wait, the example for Neutral is more like stating a fact without argument. So perhaps CoCoRes is first, then maybe Neutral or CoCoXY. Wait, CoCoXY is comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies. Since the example here is comparing current work to cited, CoCoXY isn't applicable. So the top three would be CoCoRes, then maybe CoCoGM if there's a mention of goals or methods, but the text here is about results. So the second might be CoCoGM, but the example here is about results. Wait, the example for CoCoGM is comparing goals or methods. The example given here is comparing results. So the correct first class is CoCoRes. Then maybe Neutral if there's no further intent. So the top three would be CoCoRes, then perhaps Neutral or Support. Wait, Support is when the citation supports the current work. Here it's contrasting, so Support isn't right. So Neutral might be third. But the example for Neutral is more descriptive. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe Weakness if the cited work's results are being contrasted as a problem, but the text says "substantially differ," which is neutral. So Weakness might not apply. Therefore, the top three classes are CoCoRes, then maybe Neutral, then perhaps CoCoGM if there's any method comparison. But the text doesn't mention methods. So the answer would be CoCoRes first, then Neutral, then maybe CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two cited studies. But in this case, it's current vs cited. So maybe Neutral is third. Wait, but the example for Neutral is a descriptive citation without argument. So perhaps CoCoRes is first, then Neutral, then maybe CoCoGM. But I'm not sure. Let me check again. The example for CoCoRes is exactly matching the given case. So the first is CoCoRes. The second could be CoCoGM if there's a comparison of goals or methods. The text here mentions experiments with deuterium saturated metal targets, which is a method. So maybe CoCoGM is second. The third could be Neutral. So the top three would be CoCoRes, CoCoGM, Neutral. Wait, but the example for CoCoGM is comparing goals or methods. The text here says "experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets," which refers to methods. So comparing methods between current and cited work. So CoCoGM would be second. Neutral is third if there's no other intent. Therefore, the final answer would be CoCoRes, CoCoGM, Neutral.
