Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." So the citation here is being used to compare the results of the current study with those from a previous experiment.

Next, identifying the general intent. The phrase "substantially differ" indicates a comparison of results. According to the definitions, when comparing results directly, the class should be CoCoRes. That's the primary class here. 

Looking for secondary classes, the citation isn't contrasting methods or goals, nor is it pointing out weaknesses or similarities beyond the result comparison. The context is straightforwardly contrasting findings, so CoCoRes is the top. There's no mention of future work or support, so the next classes might be Neutral or maybe CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two cited studies. But in this case, the citation is only comparing the cited work's results with the current one, not multiple cited studies with each other. So CoCoXY isn't applicable here. Neutral might come into play if the citation was just stated factually without comparison, but here it's a direct contrast. 

Therefore, the primary is CoCoRes. The next could be Neutral if there's any neutral mention, but the example given for Neutral is more about stating facts without comparison. Since the example here is a direct comparison of results, CoCoRes is first. The second might be CoCoGM if there's a method or goal comparison, but the example here is about results. Maybe Neutral is third if there's any neutral part, but the passage is focused on the result comparison. So the top three would be CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral if there's any neutral aspect, but I think CoCoRes is the only one here. Wait, the example given for CoCoRes is exactly similar to the passage. So the top is CoCoRes. The next could be Neutral if the rest of the sentence is neutral, but the sentence is all about comparison. Maybe Neutral isn't applicable here. Alternatively, perhaps the citation is used to support the current finding by contrasting, but Support is different. Hmm. Maybe the second is CoCoXY if comparing explanations, but the example for CoCoXY involves comparing two cited studies. Since here it's comparing cited with current, CoCoRes is correct. The third might be Neutral if there's any other part, but the context is focused on the comparison. So the top three would be CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral if there's any neutral mention, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the third is Basis if the cited work is foundational, but the example here isn't about foundation. So perhaps Neutral is third as the citation is just stating the previous result without further analysis. So the final ranking would be CoCoRes, then Neutral, then maybe CoCoGM as a lower priority.
