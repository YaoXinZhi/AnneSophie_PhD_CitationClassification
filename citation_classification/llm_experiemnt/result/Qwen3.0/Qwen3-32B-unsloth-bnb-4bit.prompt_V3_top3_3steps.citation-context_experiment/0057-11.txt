Okay, let's start by looking at the context around the citation. The sentence says, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." 

First, I need to extract the relevant part. The key part here is comparing the results of the current work with those from the cited study. The phrase "substantially differ" indicates a direct comparison of results. 

Looking at the general intent, this is clearly a comparison of findings between the two studies. According to the definitions, CoCoRes is when the citation is used to compare results. That's the primary class here.

Next, are there other possible classes? The comparison is between the current work and the cited paper, not between two cited studies, so CoCoXY isn't applicable. There's no mention of future work or motivation here. The citation isn't supporting the current work but contrasting it. So the main classes would be CoCoRes first. 

Is there a secondary intent? Maybe Neutral if it's just stating a fact, but since it's a direct comparison of results, CoCoRes is more specific. The third class might be Neutral if there's no other intent, but the primary is definitely CoCoRes. The example given for CoCoRes matches this scenario exactly. So the top three would be CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral as a lower priority, but I need to check if there's another possible class. Since the comparison is direct and specific to results, CoCoRes is the main one. The other possible could be CoCoGM if it's about methods or goals, but the sentence mentions "results" explicitly. So CoCoRes is the primary, then maybe Neutral if there's no other intent. But the example given for CoCoRes is almost identical to this case. So the top three would be CoCoRes, then perhaps Neutral if there's no other, but since the comparison is clear, maybe only CoCoRes is needed. Wait, the user wants three classes. Let me check again. The example for CoCoRes is when the results are directly compared. The sentence here does that. So the first class is CoCoRes. Are there others? Maybe Neutral if it's just stating a fact without further implication, but the act of comparing results is already CoCoRes. Maybe the third is Neutral if there's no other intent. Alternatively, perhaps Support if they're using the cited work to support their own, but in this case, they're contrasting. So the top three would be CoCoRes, then maybe CoCoGM or CoCoXY if applicable. But the example for CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies, not the current work. Here, the comparison is between current and cited, so CoCoRes is correct. Therefore, the top three would be CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral as the third. Wait, but Neutral is when the citation is neutral. The example for Neutral is when it's just stating a fact without supporting or comparing. But here, the citation is used to compare results. So Neutral is not applicable here. Maybe the other classes are CoCoGM or CoCoXY, but since it's about results, CoCoRes is the only one. So perhaps the top three are CoCoRes, then Neutral, then maybe Basis? Wait, Basis is foundational. The example for Basis is when the cited work is the foundation. Here, it's a comparison of results, so Basis isn't applicable. Hmm. Maybe the top three are CoCoRes, then Neutral, then maybe CoCoGM if there's a mention of methods, but the sentence mentions "results". So perhaps CoCoRes is the only applicable class, but the user wants three. Maybe Neutral is the second if there's no other intent. Alternatively, maybe CoCoRes is first, then CoCoXY if it's comparing two cited works, but in this case, it's comparing current work with cited. So CoCoXY is not applicable. Therefore, the top three would be CoCoRes, then maybe Neutral, then Basis. Wait, Basis is when the cited work is foundational. Since the current work is contrasting results, not building on it, Basis isn't right. So maybe the top three are CoCoRes, then Neutral, then CoCoGM. But CoCoGM is comparison of goals or methods. The sentence mentions results, so CoCoGM isn't the right fit. Therefore, the correct classes are CoCoRes as first, then maybe Neutral as second if there's no other, but Neutral isn't really applicable here. Wait, perhaps the third could be CoCoXY if there's a mention of two studies, but in this case, it's only comparing current work and one cited study. So CoCoXY is not applicable. Maybe the third is Weakness, but the sentence isn't criticizing the cited work. So Weakness isn't right. Hmm. Maybe the top three are CoCoRes, then Neutral, then Support. But Support is when the cited work supports the current one. Here, it's contrasting, so Support isn't correct. Therefore, the only applicable class is CoCoRes. But the user wants three. Maybe Neutral is the second if the citation is neutral in some way, but the act of comparing results is not neutral. Wait, Neutral is when the citation is used descriptively without supporting, comparing, etc. But here, the citation is used to compare results, so Neutral isn't applicable. Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me recheck the example for CoCoRes: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@" â€“ this exactly matches the example given for CoCoRes. So CoCoRes is the primary class. Since the user requires three classes, perhaps the next two are Neutral and then maybe Basis. But Basis isn't applicable here. Alternatively, maybe Neutral is the second, but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe the third is CoCoGM if there's an implication about methods. The sentence mentions "experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets", which refers to methods. So maybe CoCoGM is also applicable here because it's comparing methods. Wait, the example for CoCoGM is comparing goals or methods. The sentence here is comparing results, but the method is mentioned. So perhaps CoCoGM is also a possible class here. Wait, the user's example for CoCoRes is about comparing results, and the sentence here is about comparing results. But the method is part of the cited study's setup. However, the comparison is between results, not methods. So CoCoGM might not be applicable. Hmm. Maybe the top three are CoCoRes, then CoCoXY, but CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies. Since this is comparing current work with cited, CoCoXY isn't applicable. Therefore, the correct answer is CoCoRes as the first, then maybe Neutral as the second and third. But Neutral isn't really applicable here. Wait, perhaps the user expects three classes even if some are less fitting. Maybe Neutral is the third. So the final answer would be CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral and then Basis. But Basis is not correct. Alternatively, maybe CoCoRes is first, then CoCoGM and then CoCoXY. But I'm not sure. Given the example matches CoCoRes exactly, I think the first is CoCoRes. The other two might be Neutral and then maybe Basis. But I'm not certain. Since the task requires three, perhaps the answer is CoCoRes, then Neutral, then Basis. But Basis isn't correct. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the user expects only CoCoRes and then two others that are less relevant. Maybe Neutral and then CoCoGM. But I'm not confident. Based on the example given, CoCoRes is definitely the first. The other two might be Neutral and then CoCoXY. But again, CoCoXY is not applicable here. So perhaps the correct answer is CoCoRes, then Neutral, then CoCoGM. But I'm not sure. Maybe the answer is CoCoRes, then Neutral, then CoCoXY. But given the example, I think CoCoRes is the only correct class. However, since the user requires three, I'll proceed with CoCoRes as the first, then Neutral as the second, and then maybe CoCoGM as the third, even if it's a stretch.
