Okay, let me try to figure this out. The task is to determine the top three rhetorical classes for the given citation in the scientific passage. First, I need to extract the context around the citation. Let me look at the passage again.

The citation is mentioned in the sentence: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@."

So the context is comparing the results of the current study with those from previous experiments using specific metal targets. The key words here are "substantially differ from the results," which indicates a direct comparison between the findings of the current work and the cited study. 

According to the definitions, CoCoRes is when the citation is used to compare or contrast results. That seems to fit perfectly here because the sentence is directly contrasting the results. 

Next, looking at other possible classes. The example for CoCoRes matches this scenario exactly. There's no mention of comparing methods or goals, so CoCoGM isn't likely. Also, there's no indication that this is part of a broader comparison between two other studies (which would be CoCoXY), so that's probably not it. 

Is there any other intent? The sentence isn't supporting the current work's findings with previous research (Support), nor is it motivating the research by pointing out a gap (Motivation). It's a direct contrast of results, so CoCoRes is the primary class. 

For the second and third places, maybe Neutral? But the sentence is making a specific comparison, so Neutral might not be right. Maybe there's a Basis here? No, because the citation isn't providing the foundational basis but is being contrasted. 

Looking at the example for CoCoRes again, it's exactly about differing results. So CoCoRes is definitely first. 

Could there be a CoCoXY? The example for CoCoXY involves comparing two cited studies with each other, not the current paper. In this case, the comparison is between the current work and the cited study, so CoCoXY isn't applicable. 

What about Future or Weakness? The sentence isn't suggesting future work or criticizing the cited study. So those are out. 

Therefore, the top three would be CoCoRes as the primary class. Then maybe Neutral if there's no other intent, but since it's a direct comparison, Neutral might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps Support isn't applicable here. Wait, Support is when the citation supports the current work. Here, the results differ, so it's contrasting, not supporting. 

So the top three classes here would be CoCoRes first. Then maybe Neutral if there's no other intent. But maybe there's another class. Let me check again. 

Wait, the example for CoCoRes is when results differ. So that's the main class. The second could be Basis? No, because Basis is foundational. Third might be Neutral. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the citation isn't supporting anything else. 

Alternatively, maybe the citation is being used to highlight a difference, which is CoCoRes, and there's no other clear secondary classes. Since the example given in CoCoRes is similar, I think CoCoRes is the only applicable class here. But the task asks for three classes. 

Hmm, perhaps the second could be Neutral if the citation is just stating a fact without further implication. But the sentence is making a contrast, so Neutral might not fit. Maybe the third is Neutral. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's another class. Let me check the definitions again. 

CoCoRes is definitely first. Second might be CoCoXY if it's comparing two cited studies, but here it's comparing cited study with current work. So CoCoXY is out. 

Maybe the third is Basis? Not really. Or maybe Support isn't applicable. 

Wait, the example for Support says "support, confirm the work, result or finding of the citing authors." Here, the results differ, so Support is the opposite. 

Therefore, the top three classes would be CoCoRes (1), then maybe Neutral (2), then maybe Basis (3)? But Basis is when the citation is the foundation. 

Alternatively, maybe the citation is not supporting, motivating, or anything else. So Neutral could be third. 

But I'm not certain. Since the example given in CoCoRes matches exactly, I'll stick with CoCoRes as first. The second and third might be Neutral and something else, but perhaps Neutral is the only other possible. 

So the final answer would be CoCoRes as first, then Neutral as second, then maybe Basis as third? Not sure. Wait, the task says to rank three. Maybe the second is Neutral and third is something else. But I'm not sure. Maybe the second is Neutral because the citation is just stating a fact without further intent beyond comparison. 

So the top three would be CoCoRes, then Neutral, then maybe CoCoGM if there's any mention of methods, but there isn't. 

Therefore, the answer is CoCoRes first, Neutral second, and maybe Basis third. But Basis is about foundational, which isn't the case here. 

Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is CoCoRes first, then Neutral second, and Basis third. But I'm not confident about Basis. Alternatively, maybe Weakness isn't applicable here. 

Given the strict definitions, the only applicable class is CoCoRes. But the task requires three classes. Maybe Neutral is second and something else third. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in my analysis. Let me re-read the example for CoCoRes. The example says "substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted..." which matches the given sentence. So CoCoRes is definitely first. 

For the second and third, maybe there's no other applicable classes, so Neutral might be forced as the second and third. But Neutral is when the citation is neutral. Since the citation is being used to contrast results, maybe Neutral isn't appropriate. 

Wait, Neutral is when the citation is used in a neutral, descriptive way without supporting, comparing, criticizing, etc. In this case, the citation is being used to compare results, so Neutral isn't correct. Therefore, maybe the second and third classes are not applicable. But the task requires three classes. 

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again. The example given in CoCoRes is a direct comparison of results. So CoCoRes is first. The other two classes might not be present. Maybe the answer is CoCoRes, then Basis, then Neutral. But why Basis? 

Alternatively, maybe the citation is providing a basis for the current work's comparison. Wait, Basis is when the citation is the intellectual foundation. Here, the citation is being contrasted, not serving as a foundation. 

I'm stuck. The example given in CoCoRes matches exactly, so that's first. The other two classes might not be applicable. But since the task requires three, perhaps Neutral is forced as the second and third. 

Alternatively, maybe the citation is also providing a Support in some way. But the results differ, so Support isn't applicable. 

Given the strict definitions, the only applicable class is CoCoRes. But the task requires three, so maybe Neutral and Basis are forced. 

But I think the correct answer is CoCoRes as first, then Neutral as second, then maybe CoCoXY as third. But CoCoXY is for comparing two cited studies, which isn't the case here. 

I think the correct answer is CoCoRes as first, then maybe Neutral as second, then Basis as third. But I'm not confident. However, according to the definitions, CoCoRes is the only clear one. The other two might not be applicable. 

But the task requires three classes, so perhaps Neutral is forced. Maybe the citation is being used neutrally in some way. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is CoCoRes, then CoCoXY, then Neutral. But that doesn't fit. 

Given the example provided in the user's instructions, the correct answer is CoCoRes first. The second and third might be Neutral and something else, but since there's no other clear class, I'll proceed with CoCoRes as first, then Neutral as second, then maybe Basis as third. 

But I'm not sure. Maybe the answer is CoCoRes first, then Neutral second, then Basis third. Even though Basis isn't accurate here, it's the best I can do given the task's requirement for three classes.
