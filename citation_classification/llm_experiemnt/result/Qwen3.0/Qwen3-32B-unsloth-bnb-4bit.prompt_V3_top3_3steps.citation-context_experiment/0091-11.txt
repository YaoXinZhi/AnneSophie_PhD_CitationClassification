Okay, let's tackle this classification problem step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the citation marked @@CITATION@@. The passage provided is:

"The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@."

So the context here is about comparing the current study's results with those from experiments using specific metal targets cited. The key phrase here is "substantially differ," which indicates a direct comparison of results.

Next, I need to determine the general intent. Since the sentence is contrasting the results of the current work with those cited, this points towards a Comparative intent. According to the guidelines, Comparative corresponds to CoCoRes, CoCoGM, or CoCoXY. The example given for CoCoRes is similar to this case, where results are directly compared. 

Looking at the definitions again: CoCoRes is when the citation is used to compare or contrast results or findings. The example provided in the instructions is almost identical to the current case. So CoCoRes is the primary class here. 

Now, are there other possible classes? The next step is to check for secondary classes. The sentence doesn't mention comparing goals or methods (CoCoGM), nor is it comparing two cited studies with each other (CoCoXY). There's no indication of future work, motivation, support, or weakness. The context is straightforwardly contrasting results, so CoCoRes is the top class. 

The Neutral class is for citations used descriptively without any comparison or argument. Here, the citation is actively being used to contrast results, so Neutral isn't appropriate. 

For the second and third classes, perhaps there's a slight hint of Basis if the cited work is foundational, but the example given for Basis involves foundational references, which doesn't fit here. Alternatively, maybe Weakness if the cited work's results are being criticized, but the sentence states "substantially differ" without implying criticism, just a factual difference. So Weakness isn't fitting. 

Thus, the top three classes would be CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral if forced, but since the comparison is direct, Neutral might not be appropriate. However, looking back, the example for CoCoRes is very similar, so CoCoRes is definitely first. For the next two, perhaps CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two cited studies, but there's only one citation here. So Neutral might come in third if there's any neutral mention, but the context is about comparison. Wait, the example for Neutral is when the citation is used descriptively. In this case, the citation is part of a comparison, so Neutral isn't applicable. Maybe there's no second or third class here, but according to the task, we need three. Perhaps CoCoXY is possible if comparing explanations, but the example for CoCoXY involves comparing two cited studies. Since this is comparing the current work to the cited work, CoCoRes is the only relevant class here. However, the task requires three, so maybe Neutral is forced as third. Alternatively, maybe Basis if the cited work is foundational, but the example for Basis is different. Hmm. Maybe CoCoRes is first, Neutral second, and then perhaps Weakness third? But there's no indication of weakness. I'm a bit stuck here. Given the strict instructions, the primary is CoCoRes. The next could be Neutral if the citation is also providing background, but the example for Neutral is more like stating a fact without argument. Since the citation here is part of a comparison, maybe Neutral isn't right. Alternatively, maybe Support if the cited work's results are being contrasted, but Support is when the citation supports the current work. Since it's a difference, Support isn't applicable. So perhaps the top three are CoCoRes, then Neutral, then Basis? But Basis is for foundational references. Maybe Neutral is forced as the third. Alternatively, maybe there's no second or third, but the task requires three. Given the example provided in the instructions for CoCoRes matches this case exactly, I'll stick with CoCoRes as first. The next could be CoCoXY if comparing explanations, but since it's a direct comparison of results, CoCoRes is the only relevant. Maybe Neutral is third, even if not perfectly fitting. Alternatively, maybe the third is nothing, but the task requires three. So the answer would be CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral second, then Basis third. But Basis doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe CoCoRes, then CoCoXY, then Neutral. Wait, CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies. Since there's only one citation here, CoCoXY isn't applicable. So the top three would be CoCoRes, then maybe Neutral, then maybe Weakness. But Weakness isn't indicated. Hmm. Given the strict instructions, I'll proceed with CoCoRes as first, then Neutral as second, then maybe CoCoXY as third even if it's not perfect. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe there's only one class and the others are not applicable. But the task requires three. This is tricky. Based on the example given, CoCoRes is the primary class. Since the example matches exactly, I'll go with CoCoRes first. The next two might be Neutral and Basis, but Basis is foundational. Since the citation is about results comparison, Basis isn't right. Neutral would be if the citation is just stating a fact without argument, but here it's part of a comparison. So perhaps Neutral isn't applicable. Maybe the task expects CoCoRes as first, then CoCoXY as second, then Neutral as third. But the example for CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies, not the current work. Therefore, CoCoXY isn't applicable here. Given all that, the top three are CoCoRes, then maybe Basis (if forced), then Neutral. But Basis doesn't fit. I think the correct answer is CoCoRes first, then Neutral second, then Basis third, even though Basis might not be the best fit. Alternatively, maybe there's only one valid class. But the task requires three. I'll proceed with CoCoRes as first, then Neutral as second, then maybe CoCoGM as third, even though the comparison is of results, not goals or methods. This is challenging, but based on the strict example provided, CoCoRes is the primary class.
