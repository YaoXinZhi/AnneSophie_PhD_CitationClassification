Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the rhetorical classes for the given citation in the passage. First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage says, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." 

So the citation here is being used to compare the results of the current study with those from previous experiments. The key phrase is "substantially differ," which indicates a direct comparison of results. Looking at the predefined classes, CoCoRes is specifically for comparing results. That's probably the main class here.

Next, I need to check if there are other possible classes. The comparison is between the present work and the cited work, not between two cited studies, so CoCoXY isn't applicable. There's no mention of methods or goals, so CoCoGM is out. The citation isn't supporting the current work or pointing out weaknesses, so Support and Weakness don't fit. The context is straightforward comparison of results, so CoCoRes is first. 

For the second and third classes, maybe Neutral could be a fallback if there's no other intent, but the example for Neutral is more descriptive without comparison. Since the main intent is CoCoRes, the others would be less relevant. Maybe Basis or Motivation? But the citation isn't establishing a foundation or motivating the research. So Neutral might be the next. But the example for Neutral is more about stating facts without argument. The given example for CoCoRes is very similar to the passage here. So the top three would be CoCoRes, then maybe Neutral, then perhaps Basis if there's any foundational aspect. But in this case, the citation is purely for comparison, so Neutral and maybe Future? Wait, Future is about suggesting future work. No, the passage isn't doing that. So Neutral might be second. Then maybe Basis as third if there's any foundation, but I don't see that here. Alternatively, maybe Similar? But the results are different, not similar. So Neutral is the third. So the top three are CoCoRes, Neutral, and maybe CoCoXY? Wait, CoCoXY is for comparing two cited studies. The example given for CoCoXY mentions conflicting results between two studies. Here, the comparison is between the current work and the cited study. So CoCoXY isn't applicable. Therefore, the top three are CoCoRes, Neutral, and maybe Basis if there's a foundational aspect. But the citation isn't establishing a foundation; it's contrasting results. So Neutral is the third. So the final list is CoCoRes first, Neutral second, and maybe CoCoGM or CoCoRes again? Wait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The passage is comparing results of present work with cited work, so CoCoRes is first. The other options are Neutral and maybe Future or Weakness. But the example for Neutral is more about stating facts. Here, the comparison is direct, so Neutral might not be the best second. Maybe there's no second class, but since we need three, perhaps Neutral is the best fit. Alternatively, maybe Motivation. But the citation isn't motivating the research; it's contrasting results. So Neutral is the second. Then maybe Basis as third if there's a foundational aspect, but I don't see it. So the top three are CoCoRes, Neutral, Basis? Or maybe Neutral is second and then something else. Hmm. I think the correct answer is CoCoRes first, then Neutral second, and maybe CoCoXY third if applicable, but it's not. So Neutral is third. Wait, maybe Weakness? No, the citation isn't criticizing the cited work. So Neutral is the third.
