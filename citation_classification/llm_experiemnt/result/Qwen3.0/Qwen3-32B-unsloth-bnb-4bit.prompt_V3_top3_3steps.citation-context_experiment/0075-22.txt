Okay, let's tackle this classification task. First, I need to look at the context around the citation. The passage mentions, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets... @@CITATION@@." 

So the main point here is comparing the current results with those from a previous study. The example given for CoCoRes is exactly this kind of comparison where results are contrasted. That makes me think CoCoRes is the primary class here.

Next, the citation is being used to highlight differences in outcomes between two studies. There's no mention of comparing explanations or claims between two cited works (which would be CoCoXY), nor is it about goals or methods (CoCoGM). The context is straightforwardly about contrasting results, so CoCoRes is definitely first.

Looking for secondary classes, maybe Neutral could come into play if the citation is just stated without much elaboration, but the sentence is clearly contrasting results, so Neutral isn't the best fit. Perhaps Support if they were backing up their claim, but here it's the oppositeâ€”they're showing a difference. 

Wait, maybe there's another layer. If the authors are contrasting their results with prior work, that's CoCoRes as primary. The Neutral class would be if they just mentioned the citation without a specific comparison, but since they're directly contrasting, Neutral isn't right. Maybe Future or Motivation? No, the context isn't about future work or motivating their study. 

So the top three would be CoCoRes first. Then, maybe Neutral as a secondary if there's a neutral mention elsewhere, but in this case, the sentence is focused on comparison. Hmm. The example given for CoCoRes is similar, so I think CoCoRes is first. Then perhaps Neutral if there's no other comparison, but I don't see another class here. Wait, maybe Weakness? If they're pointing out flaws in the cited work, but the example here is about differing results, not necessarily flaws. 

So the top three would be CoCoRes as first, then maybe Neutral if there's a neutral mention elsewhere, but the sentence is about comparison. Alternatively, maybe CoCoXY if comparing explanations, but the example given for CoCoXY involves comparing two studies with each other, not the current paper and a cited one. So CoCoRes is definitely first. The second could be Neutral if the citation is also being used in a descriptive way elsewhere, but the given context is specific to comparing results. Therefore, the top three are CoCoRes, then maybe Neutral as a lower priority if there's no other intent. Wait, the example for Neutral is just stating a fact without argument. Since the citation here is part of a comparison, Neutral might not fit. Maybe Weakness? No, unless they're criticizing the cited work. 

So the primary is CoCoRes. Then, perhaps Neutral if there's no other intent. But maybe the second is CoCoXY? No, CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies with each other, not the current one. So the only applicable here is CoCoRes. Then maybe Neutral as a secondary if there's a neutral mention elsewhere in the paragraph, but the sentence is focused on comparison. Hmm. The example given for CoCoRes is exactly matching this scenario. So the top three would be CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral if there's a neutral aspect, but I'm not seeing it. Alternatively, maybe the second is CoCoGM or CoCoRes again. Wait, the instructions say three classes, but the example only has CoCoRes. So perhaps the top three are CoCoRes, Neutral, and then maybe Support? Wait, no. Let me re-express: the citation is used to compare results, so CoCoRes is first. The other possible classes could be Neutral if the citation is also being used descriptively elsewhere. But the given sentence is only about the comparison. So maybe CoCoRes is first, Neutral second if there's no other intent, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe Weakness if they're pointing out a limitation. But the example here says "substantially differ", which isn't necessarily a weakness. So the top three would be CoCoRes, then maybe Neutral, then perhaps CoCoXY as a lower priority. But I think CoCoRes is the only applicable here. Maybe the user expects three classes, so perhaps Neutral and CoCoXY as the others. Wait, looking at the example for Neutral, it's a simple statement without argument. Since the given citation is part of a comparison, Neutral isn't the case here. Hmm. Maybe the second is CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two cited works, but the example here is between current and cited. So perhaps the top three are CoCoRes, then Neutral, then maybe CoCoGM. But I'm not sure. Given the example provided, CoCoRes is the primary. The second could be Neutral if there's no other intent, but the sentence is clearly contrasting results. Therefore, the top three would be CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral as a secondary, but I'm not certain. Wait, perhaps the second is Weakness if the cited work's results are considered flawed. But the example says "substantially differ", not necessarily flawed. So maybe Weakness isn't appropriate. Therefore, the top three would be CoCoRes, then maybe Neutral and then another. But I'm struggling here. The example given in the task is CoCoRes as the primary. Let me stick with CoCoRes first, then Neutral as a secondary if possible, but I'm not seeing it. Maybe the answer is CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral and then another. Wait, perhaps the second is CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two cited works, but the context is between current and cited. So the correct answer is CoCoRes first, then Neutral if there's a neutral mention elsewhere. But the sentence is focused on comparison. Hmm. Maybe the answer is CoCoRes first, then CoCoXY second if there's an implicit comparison between two cited works, but the example here doesn't mention another study. Therefore, the top three are CoCoRes, then Neutral, then maybe CoCoGM. But I'm not confident. Let's go with CoCoRes first, then Neutral and CoCoXY as the others, but I'm not sure. Wait, the example given for CoCoRes is exactly matching the scenario here. So the primary is CoCoRes. The second could be Neutral if the citation is also used descriptively elsewhere. But the sentence is about comparison. Maybe Neutral isn't applicable here. So perhaps CoCoRes is first, then maybe Weakness and then Neutral. But again, the context doesn't indicate weakness. Hmm. I think the correct answer is CoCoRes first, then Neutral and CoCoXY as the others, but I'm not certain. Wait, the example given in the task's instructions for CoCoRes is the same as the context here. Therefore, the top three should be CoCoRes, then maybe Neutral and CoCoXY. Wait, but the example given for CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies with each other, not the current one. So CoCoXY isn't applicable here. Therefore, the top three are CoCoRes, then maybe Neutral and then another. But Neutral isn't fitting here. Hmm. Maybe the answer is CoCoRes first, then Neutral second, then maybe CoCoGM third. But I'm not sure. Given the context, the most accurate classification is CoCoRes first. The other two might not be applicable, but since the task requires three, perhaps Neutral is listed second and third. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, maybe the answer is CoCoRes first, then Neutral, then CoCoXY. But again, CoCoXY isn't applicable here. I think the correct answer is CoCoRes first, then Neutral and CoCoXY as the others, but I'm not certain. Given the example provided, CoCoRes is the primary class here.
