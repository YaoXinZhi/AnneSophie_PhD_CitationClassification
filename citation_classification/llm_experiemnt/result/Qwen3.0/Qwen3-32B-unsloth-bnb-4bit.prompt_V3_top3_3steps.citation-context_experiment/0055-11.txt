Okay, let's tackle this classification problem step by step. 

First, I need to extract the context around the @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. The passage mentions that the authors used a method described in a previous study (the citation) to analyze the data. The specific sentence is: "We employed the qPCR technique as outlined by @@CITATION@@ to quantify the pathogen load in the samples."

Next, identifying the general intent. The citation here is referencing a method that the current study uses. According to the definitions, if the citation is about a method directly used in the current work, the intent is technical, which maps to the "Usage" class.

Now, looking at the top three rhetorical classes. The primary class here is clearly "Usage" because the method from the cited work is being applied. The next possible classes might be "Support" if they're confirming the method's validity, but the passage doesn't state that they're supporting the previous findings, just using the method. There's no comparison or motivation mentioned either. The most neutral use would be if they're just mentioning it factually without any specific intent beyond usage. However, since the example for "Usage" includes using a method, this is the primary class. The next could be "Support" if they're endorsing the method, but without explicit confirmation, maybe "Neutral" is secondary. Wait, the example for "Usage" is about an experimental setup being described in a previous paper. Here, it's a method (qPCR) being used. So "Usage" is definitely first. Then, perhaps "Support" if they're confirming the method's effectiveness, but the text doesn't say that. The third could be "Neutral" if it's just a factual mention. So the top three would be Usage, then maybe Support if there's confirmation, but since the example for Support mentions "confirm the work, result or finding," and here it's just using the method, maybe Support isn't applicable. Alternatively, maybe "Basis" if the method is foundational. Wait, "Basis" is when the citation is the intellectual foundation. But in this case, it's a specific method used, so "Usage" is more accurate. The secondary could be "Support" if they're using the method to support their own results, but again, the example for Support is about confirming previous results. Here, they're using the method, not confirming results. So perhaps the next classes are Neutral and then maybe Basis. But Basis is more about the foundation of the research. If the method is foundational, maybe Basis could be second. However, the primary is Usage. The third might be Neutral. Let me check the definitions again. "Neutral" is when the citation is used descriptively without supporting, comparing, etc. In this case, the citation is directly about a method used, which is a technical aspect, so "Usage" is first. The next could be "Support" if they're using the method to support their approach, but the example for Support is about confirming results. Maybe "Neutral" is third here. So the top three would be Usage, then maybe Basis if the method is foundational, but I think Usage is the main one. Alternatively, maybe "Support" isn't applicable. So the final ranking would be 1. Usage, 2. Support, 3. Neutral. Wait, but in the example for Support, they mention "support, confirm the work, result or finding." Here, they're using the method, not confirming a result. So maybe Support isn't the right second class. Maybe Neutral is second. Hmm. Let me re-examine. The citation is used to reference a method that's directly applied. So Usage is first. Then, perhaps Neutral if it's just a factual mention. But the example for Neutral includes a citation that's descriptive without supporting or comparing. In this case, the citation is directly about a method used, so Usage is primary. The second could be Basis if the method is the foundation, but Basis is more about intellectual foundation, like introducing a concept. If the method is foundational to the study's approach, Basis could be second. However, if the method is just a tool used, then Usage is first, and maybe Neutral is second. Wait, the example for Usage is about an experimental setup described in a previous paper. Here, it's a method (qPCR technique) being used. So Usage is first. The second could be Support if they're using the method to support their analysis, but again, Support is about confirming results. Maybe Neutral is third. Alternatively, maybe there's no second class besides Usage, but the task requires three. So perhaps Usage is first, then maybe Neutral as the second, and then maybe Basis as third. Wait, but Basis is about intellectual foundation. If the cited work introduced the qPCR method, then Basis could be second. However, if the cited work just described the method's application in a different context, then Basis might not apply. Without more context, it's hard, but given the example for Usage is about using a method, I think Usage is first. The next could be Support if they're using the method to support their own findings, but again, that's not clear. Maybe Neutral is second. So the top three would be Usage, Neutral, Basis. But I need to check the definitions again. Let me think: the example for Support is "support, confirm the work, result or finding." Here, they're using the method, not confirming a result, so Support isn't applicable. Neutral is when it's descriptive. Since the citation is about a method used, which is technical, Usage is first. Then maybe Neutral as the second if it's just a factual mention. But maybe there's no second class besides Usage. Wait, the task requires three classes. So perhaps Usage is first, then maybe Neutral as second, and then maybe Basis as third. Alternatively, maybe there's no other applicable classes. Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is Usage as first, then maybe Support isn't applicable, Neutral as second, and then maybe Basis as third. But I need to ensure that these are the top three from the list. Let me check again. The citation is used to reference the method employed. So Usage is first. Then, perhaps Neutral if it's just a factual mention. But Neutral's example is about a descriptive citation without supporting, comparing, etc. In this case, the citation is directly about a method used, which is technical, so Usage is first. There's no comparison or support mentioned. So the next could be Neutral, as it's a neutral mention. The third might be Basis if the method is foundational. But again, Basis is when the citation is the intellectual foundation. If the cited work introduced the qPCR method, then Basis would apply. Otherwise, if it's just applying the method, maybe Basis isn't. Without knowing if the cited work introduced the method, it's hard to say. But given the example for Basis is about introducing and validating a concept, maybe Basis isn't applicable here. So perhaps the top three are Usage, Neutral, then maybe Support if there's any support. Wait, the example for Support is when the current work's results align with previous ones. Here, they're using the method, not supporting results. So Support isn't applicable. Therefore, the top three would be Usage, then Neutral, then maybe Basis. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe Neutral isn't the second class. Maybe the correct answer is Usage as first, then maybe Support isn't applicable, Neutral as second, and then Basis as third. Given the ambiguity, I'll go with Usage as first, then maybe Neutral as second, and then Basis as third. But I'm not entirely confident. Let me check the definitions again. The example for Usage is "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@." Here, the method is being used, so Usage is correct. The second could be Support if they're confirming the method's validity, but the text doesn't state that. Neutral is when it's descriptive. Since the citation is directly about a method used, Neutral might not be the second class. Wait, maybe there's no second class besides Usage. But the task requires three. Maybe the correct answer is Usage, then maybe Neutral, then Basis. Alternatively, maybe the second is Support if they're using the method to support their analysis. But again, Support is about confirming results. Hmm. I think the correct answer is 1. Usage, 2. Neutral, 3. Basis. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe there's no second class besides Usage. Maybe the correct answer is Usage, then Neutral, then Basis. Let me proceed with that.
