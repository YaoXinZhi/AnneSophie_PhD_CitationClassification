Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the top three rhetorical classes for the citation tagged in this passage. First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage says, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." So the context is about comparing the current results with those from another study using different metal targets.

Next, identifying the general intent. The key phrase here is "substantially differ from the results of..." which indicates a comparison of results between the current study and the cited work. That points towards the Comparative category, specifically CoCoRes. 

Now, looking at the specific classes. CoCoRes is definitely the primary one here because they are directly contrasting their results with the cited experiments. Then, maybe CoCoXY if there's a comparison between explanations or claims of two studies, but in this case, it's more about the results themselves rather than explanations. The example given for CoCoRes matches this scenario closely. 

Is there any other class? The passage doesn't mention supporting their own findings with the cited work, so Support isn't applicable. There's no indication of future work or motivation here. Neutral is unlikely because they are making a direct comparison. Weakness would be if they were criticizing the cited study, but they're just stating a difference. 

So the top three would be CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral if there's any neutral mention, but the example for Neutral is more about stating facts without argument. However, the main action here is the comparison of results. Perhaps CoCoXY is a stretch unless they are comparing two cited studies. Wait, the example for CoCoXY is when comparing two cited studies with each other, not with the current paper. Here, the comparison is between the current work and the cited work, so CoCoRes is correct. 

So the top three are CoCoRes, then maybe Neutral if there's a secondary neutral mention, but the example given for Neutral is more about stating facts. Since the passage is directly contrasting results, CoCoRes is first. There's no other clear secondary class here. Maybe Neutral isn't applicable. Wait, maybe Basis isn't relevant here. So the top three would be CoCoRes, then perhaps Neutral if there's a neutral part, but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe there's no Neutral here. The example given for CoCoRes is exactly matching this scenario. So the top three would be CoCoRes first, then maybe CoCoGM if there's a mention of methods, but the passage mentions results. So CoCoRes is the primary, then maybe Neutral if the rest of the sentence is neutral. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe CoCoRes is the only one, and the other two classes are less relevant. Wait, the user wants three classes. So perhaps CoCoRes, then Neutral, then maybe Basis if there's any foundation mentioned. But the example for Basis is about introducing a method, which isn't the case here. So the top three would be CoCoRes, Neutral, and maybe CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two studies. Wait, in the example for CoCoXY, they compare two cited studies. Here, it's comparing current work with cited work. So CoCoRes is the main one. The next could be Neutral if the rest of the sentence is neutral. Let me check the Neutral example: "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@." That's a factual statement without argument. In our case, the sentence is stating a difference in results, which is a comparison, so Neutral might not apply. Wait, maybe the Neutral here is if there's a neutral mention, but the sentence is making a direct comparison. Hmm. Maybe the correct classes are CoCoRes, then maybe Basis if the cited work is foundational, but the example for Basis is about introducing a method. So perhaps CoCoRes is first, then Neutral if the rest is neutral. Alternatively, maybe CoCoRes is the only relevant one. Wait, the user wants three classes. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me stick with CoCoRes as first, then maybe Neutral as second if there's a neutral part, and then Basis as third if applicable. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe CoCoRes is first, then CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two studies. Wait, the example for CoCoXY is when comparing two cited studies. Here, it's comparing current work with cited work, so CoCoRes is correct. The other classes might not fit. Maybe the top three are CoCoRes, then Neutral, then Basis. But I'm not confident. Let me check again. The sentence is about comparing results between current and cited work, so CoCoRes is first. Then maybe Neutral if the rest of the sentence is neutral. The Neutral example is a factual statement without argument. Here, stating a difference is a comparison, so maybe Neutral isn't the right second class. Perhaps there's no second class. Wait, the user requires three classes. Maybe CoCoRes, then Basis if the cited work is foundational, but the example for Basis is introducing a method. In this case, the cited work is providing results to compare with, not introducing a method. So Basis isn't applicable. Then maybe Neutral as second, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe CoCoRes is first, then CoCoGM if there's a comparison of goals or methods. Wait, the cited work's methods are mentioned (using deuterium saturated metal targets), but the comparison here is about results. So CoCoGM would be if they compared methods. Since they mention the methods used in the cited work but the comparison is about results, maybe CoCoRes is first, CoCoGM second. But the example for CoCoGM is comparing goals or methods. The passage says the experiments were conducted with deuterium saturated metal targets, which refers to methods. So maybe CoCoGM is also applicable here. Wait, the example for CoCoGM is comparing goals or methods between the cited work and the citing paper. In our case, the citing paper is comparing their results with the cited work's results, but they mention the methods used by the cited work. So maybe CoCoGM is not the main intent here. The main intent is comparing results. So CoCoRes is first. Then maybe Neutral if there's a neutral part. Hmm. This is tricky. Let me go back to the example given in the problem. The example for CoCoRes is exactly matching the scenario in the passage. So CoCoRes is definitely first. The other classes might not fit. Maybe the second is Neutral, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe CoCoRes is first, then maybe CoCoXY if comparing two cited studies, but the passage only cites one study. So CoCoXY isn't applicable. Therefore, the top three would be CoCoRes, then maybe Neutral, then Basis. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps CoCoRes is the only relevant one, and the other two are less so. But the user requires three. Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is CoCoRes, then Neutral, then maybe Basis. But I'm not confident. Let me proceed with CoCoRes as first, then Neutral as second, and maybe Basis as third if applicable. Wait, Basis is when the citation is the foundation. In this case, the citation provides results to compare with, not the foundation. So Basis isn't applicable. Therefore, perhaps the top three are CoCoRes, Neutral, and maybe another. Wait, maybe the correct answer is CoCoRes, then CoCoXY, but I don't see a comparison between two cited studies here. Hmm. Alright, I'll go with CoCoRes as the first, then Neutral as second, and maybe another class like CoCoGM if there's a method comparison. Wait, the cited work's methods are mentioned, but the comparison is about results. So CoCoGM would be if the citing paper compared their methods with the cited work's methods. Since they mention the methods used in the cited work but compare results, maybe CoCoGM isn't applicable. So perhaps the top three are CoCoRes, then Neutral, then maybe Basis. But Basis isn't applicable. I think the correct answer is CoCoRes, then maybe Neutral, then another class that's not fitting. Given the example, the correct answer is CoCoRes first. For the other two, maybe Neutral if the rest of the sentence is neutral. Alternatively, maybe there's no other classes. Since the user requires three, perhaps I need to include Neutral and another. Maybe the correct answer is CoCoRes, Neutral, and then Basis. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe CoCoRes is first, then CoCoGM, then Neutral. Given the uncertainty, I'll proceed with CoCoRes as first, then Neutral, then maybe Basis.
