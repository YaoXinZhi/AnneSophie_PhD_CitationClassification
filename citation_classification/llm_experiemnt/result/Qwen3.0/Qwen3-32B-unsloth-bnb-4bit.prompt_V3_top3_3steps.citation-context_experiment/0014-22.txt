Okay, let's tackle this classification problem step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. The passage mentions that the results of the present work substantially differ from experiments conducted with deuterium saturated metal targets as cited by @@CITATION@@. 

Next, I identify the general intent. The phrase "substantially differ" indicates a comparison of results between the current study and the cited work. That points towards the Comparative category. Looking at the subcategories, CoCoRes is for comparing results or findings directly. 

Now, checking for other possible classes. The citation isn't introducing foundational work, so Basis isn't likely. It's not motivating the current research either, so Motivation is out. The main comparison here is of results, making CoCoRes the top choice. 

For the second and third classes, maybe CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two cited studies, but the example given here is a direct comparison with the citing paper's results. Neutral might be there if the citation is just descriptive, but the context is clearly contrasting results. So Neutral could be third. CoCoGM or CoCoXY might not fit here since it's about results, not methods or goals. 

So the top three would be CoCoRes first, then maybe CoCoXY if there's an indirect comparison between two studies, but the example provided doesn't mention two cited works. Wait, the example for CoCoXY compares two cited studies with each other, not with the citing paper. In our case, the citation is comparing the cited work's results with the current paper's, so CoCoRes is primary. The second could be Neutral if there's no other clear subcategory, but maybe there's another. Let me check again.

Wait, the example for CoCoRes says comparing the cited work's results with the citing paper's. Our case fits that exactly. The third might be Neutral if the citation isn't doing anything else. Alternatively, if there's a mention of conflicting results, maybe Weakness? But the example for Weakness involves criticizing the cited work. Here, the difference in results is presented as a comparison, not a criticism. So Neutral would be third. So the ranking is CoCoRes, then Neutral, then maybe CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two cited works, but in this case, there isn't. So Neutral is third.
