Okay, let's tackle this classification task step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the citation marked @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. The passage says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." So the context is about comparing the current results with those from previous experiments using specific metal targets.

Next, identifying the general intent. The key phrase here is "substantially differ from the results of the experiments," which indicates a direct comparison of results between the current study and the cited work. According to the definitions, this falls under Comparative, specifically CoCoRes since it's comparing results. 

Now, looking at the fine-grained classes. The example provided for CoCoRes matches this scenario where the results are compared directly. There's no mention of contrasting methods or goals (which would be CoCoGM) or comparing explanations between two cited studies (CoCoXY). The citation isn't supporting the current work's findings (Support) or pointing out weaknesses. The intent is purely to highlight differences in results. 

For the top three classes, CoCoRes is the primary one. Then, maybe Neutral if there's any descriptive aspect, but the comparison is explicit, so Neutral might not be the second. Wait, the example for CoCoRes doesn't include Neutral as a secondary. Since the context is strictly about comparing results, the other classes like CoCoXY or CoCoGM aren't applicable here. However, perhaps there's a slight descriptive element if the citation is just stating the existence of prior results, but the main intent is comparison. 

So the top three would be CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral as a secondary if the citation is also referencing prior work descriptively, but given the example, CoCoRes is the only relevant one. However, the user might expect three classes. Wait, the example given for CoCoRes doesn't mention other classes, but maybe in some cases, the citation could also have a Basis or Support aspect. But in this case, the citation is not foundational (Basis) nor supporting the current work. It's contrasting results. So perhaps the next could be CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two studies, but the example for CoCoXY involves comparing two cited studies with each other, not with the current paper. Here, the comparison is between the current work and the cited work. So CoCoRes is the main one. Then, maybe Neutral if the citation is just stating prior results without further analysis. But Neutral is for when the citation is used in a neutral descriptive way without supporting, comparing, etc. Since the citation is actively comparing results, Neutral might not be appropriate. Hmm, perhaps the second could be CoCoGM if there's any mention of methods, but the example here is about results. So maybe CoCoRes is the only applicable one. However, the user requires three classes. Maybe the next ones are Neutral and Support. Wait, the example for Neutral is when the citation is used descriptively. In this case, the citation is used to compare results, which is not Neutral. Therefore, perhaps CoCoRes is first, then maybe Weakness if there's any criticism, but the passage states "substantially differ," which isn't necessarily a weakness. So maybe the next classes are Neutral and Support. But I'm not sure. Given the strict definitions, CoCoRes is the primary, then perhaps Neutral and Support are less likely. Maybe the top three are CoCoRes, then CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two cited studies, but in this case, it's between current and cited. So perhaps CoCoRes is the only one, but the user wants three. Maybe Neutral is included as a fallback. Alternatively, maybe there's a slight Basis aspect if the cited work is foundational for the comparison. But the example for Basis is when the cited work is the foundation. Since the citation here is for comparison of results, Basis isn't the case. Therefore, the top three would be CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral and then Support, but I'm not certain. Given the strict example, CoCoRes is the primary, and perhaps Neutral and Support are lower. However, based on the given definitions and examples, CoCoRes is the most accurate, followed by Neutral if applicable. But the example for Neutral is more about stating facts without comparison. Since the citation here is actively comparing results, Neutral might not be appropriate. Maybe the next classes are CoCoGM or CoCoXY, but those don't fit. Therefore, the final answer would be CoCoRes as first, then perhaps Neutral and then Basis. But I'm not confident. Let me recheck the example for CoCoRes: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." This matches the example given for CoCoRes exactly. So the primary class is CoCoRes. The other classes would be Neutral if there's any neutral mention, but since the comparison is explicit, Neutral isn't applicable. Maybe the next could be CoCoXY if comparing two cited studies, but here it's between current and cited. So perhaps CoCoRes is the only one. But the user requires three. Maybe Neutral is included as a fallback. Alternatively, maybe the second is Basis if the cited work is foundational for the comparison. However, the example for Basis is about introducing a method, not comparing results. So Basis is not applicable. Therefore, the top three would be CoCoRes, then Neutral, then maybe Support. But I'm not sure. Given the strict definitions, CoCoRes is the primary, Neutral might not be applicable, but perhaps the user expects three classes. Maybe the answer is CoCoRes, then Neutral, then Basis. Alternatively, perhaps there's no second or third. Given the instructions, I'll proceed with CoCoRes as first, then Neutral as second, then Basis as third, even if uncertain.
