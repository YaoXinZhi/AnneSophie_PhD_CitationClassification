Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. 

First, I need to look at the context around the @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. The user hasn't provided the actual passage, but based on the examples and definitions, I can infer typical scenarios.

Assuming a common case where the citation is used to compare results between studies, the example for CoCoRes mentions direct comparison of results. If the passage states something like "The results here contrast with those in @@CITATION@@", that's a clear CoCoRes. 

Next, if the citation is also contrasting explanations between two studies without involving the current paper's work, that would be CoCoXY. For instance, if the text says "While @@CITATION@@ found X, another study found Y", that's comparing the cited studies themselves, so CoCoXY. 

Lastly, if there's a neutral mention without any direct comparison or support, like stating a fact from the citation without analysis, that would be Neutral. 

So, ranking these, CoCoRes would be first if it's a direct result comparison. If there's also a comparison between two cited works, CoCoXY would be second. Neutral would be third if there's no strong intent beyond that. But without the exact text, I'm relying on typical examples. Let me check the definitions again to ensure accuracy. 

Yes, CoCoRes is for comparing cited work's results with the current paper's. CoCoXY is between two cited works. If the example mentions conflicting results between two studies cited, that's CoCoXY. If the current study's results differ from a cited one, that's CoCoRes. 

So, if the citation is used to compare the current study's results with a previous one, CoCoRes is first. If there's also a mention of another study's conflicting results, CoCoXY is second. If the citation is just stated as a fact without comparison, Neutral is third. 

Therefore, the top three would likely be CoCoRes, CoCoXY, and Neutral based on typical scenarios. But I need to make sure based on the definitions provided.
