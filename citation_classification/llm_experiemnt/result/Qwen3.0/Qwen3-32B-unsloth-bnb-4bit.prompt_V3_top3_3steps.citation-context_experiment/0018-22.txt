Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. The passage mentions that the authors used a method described in previous work by @@CITATION@@. The specific sentence is: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@."

Next, I need to determine the general intent of this citation. The phrase "described in detail previously" suggests that the cited work is providing the methodological foundation for the current study. The authors are referencing a prior paper to indicate that their experimental setup isn't new but follows an established method. This points towards a foundational intent, which would fall under the "Basis" class.

Looking at the specific rhetorical classes, "Usage" could also be relevant because they are directly using the method from the cited work. However, since the primary purpose here is to establish the basis of their experimental setup rather than to use a tool or dataset, "Basis" is more accurate. 

Additionally, there's no comparison with other works or motivation for future research here. The citation is straightforwardly referencing prior work as the foundation. Therefore, the top three classes would be Basis first, then Usage, and Neutral as the third since there's no explicit support, comparison, or criticism.

1. Basis  
2. Usage  
3. Neutral
