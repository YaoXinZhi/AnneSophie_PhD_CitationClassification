Okay, let's start by looking at the given passage and the citation marked @@CITATION@@. The task is to determine the top three rhetorical classes from the predefined list. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." 

So the key part here is that the authors are comparing their results to those from previous experiments using specific metal targets. The phrase "substantially differ" indicates a direct comparison of results. 

Next, I need to identify the general intent. Since they're contrasting their findings with prior results, this falls under Comparative intent, which relates to CoCoRes (Comparison of Results). 

Looking at the definitions, CoCoRes is when the citation is used to compare or contrast results. The example given in the instructions matches this scenario exactly. 

Are there other possible classes? Maybe CoCoXY if they were comparing explanations between two studies, but here it's the citing paper's results versus the cited work's results. Also, Neutral might be considered if it were just a descriptive mention, but the strong contrast suggests a direct comparison. 

Support is less likely because they're not supporting their findings with the cited work but rather showing a difference. Motivation or Future don't fit here either. 

So the top class is CoCoRes. The next possible could be CoCoXY if there's an indirect comparison between two cited studies, but in this case, it's the current work versus the cited work. Neutral might be the second if there's no strong argument, but the wording is assertive. However, since the primary intent is CoCoRes, maybe Neutral isn't the second. Wait, maybe there's a mention of previous results but the main action is contrasting results. 

Wait, the example given for CoCoRes is similar to this passage. The example says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." So the example provided in the instructions is almost identical to the given passage. Therefore, the correct class here is definitely CoCoRes. 

Are there other classes? Maybe Neutral if it's just stating facts, but the comparison is direct. So Neutral would be if they were just mentioning the study without comparing. But here, they're contrasting their results, so CoCoRes is primary. 

Then, perhaps CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two cited studies, but the passage only mentions one study. So CoCoXY is not applicable. 

What about Basis? Basis is when the citation is foundational. Here, it's not foundational but comparative. 

Support is when the citation supports the current work. Here, they're showing a difference, so Support isn't right. 

Motivation would be if the citation is explaining why the research was done, but this is about results contrast. 

So the top three would be CoCoRes as first. Then maybe Neutral as second if there's any neutral mention, but the passage is actively contrasting results. Alternatively, maybe there's no second class here. Wait, perhaps the example in the instructions for CoCoRes is the primary one, so the answer is CoCoRes as first. 

But the task asks for top three. If the passage is only comparing results, then CoCoRes is first, and maybe Neutral as second if the rest is neutral. However, the entire sentence is about comparison. Maybe the other classes aren't applicable. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mention of previous work's results, so CoCoRes is first. Then, maybe the citation is also providing context, which could be Basis. Wait, Basis is foundational. If the cited work is foundational for the current study, but here it's contrasting results, so Basis isn't right. 

So the top three would be CoCoRes first. Then maybe Neutral as second if the rest is neutral, but I don't think so. Alternatively, maybe there's a mention of the cited work's results, so CoCoRes is first. The second could be CoCoXY if comparing two cited studies, but the example given in the instructions for CoCoXY involves comparing two cited works. Here, the cited work is only one. 

Therefore, CoCoRes is the primary class. The other classes might be Neutral or CoCoXY, but since there's only one cited work, CoCoXY isn't applicable. Neutral would be if the citation is just mentioned without any comparison. But the sentence is a direct comparison. 

So maybe the top three are CoCoRes, then maybe Weakness if the cited work's results are being criticized. Wait, Weakness is when the citation is used to criticize or point out limitations. Here, the authors are stating that their results differ substantially, which could imply that the cited work's results are different, but not necessarily flawed. So Weakness might not apply unless they're pointing out flaws. 

In the example given for Weakness, the cited work's results are described as problematic. Here, the cited work's results are just different, not necessarily wrong. So Weakness isn't appropriate. 

Therefore, the top three classes are CoCoRes first. Since the task requires three, maybe Neutral is the second if there's any neutral mention, but the entire sentence is comparative. Alternatively, maybe CoCoRes is first, and the other two are Neutral and CoCoXY, but CoCoXY isn't applicable here. 

Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is CoCoRes as first, then maybe Neutral as second if the citation is used descriptively in part. Wait, the example given for Neutral is when the citation is used descriptively without supporting or comparing. In the given passage, the citation is part of a comparison, so Neutral isn't the second. 

Therefore, perhaps the only applicable class is CoCoRes, and the other two are Neutral and something else. But since the instructions require three, maybe the top three are CoCoRes, then maybe CoCoGM or CoCoXY, but those aren't applicable here. 

Wait, maybe the answer is CoCoRes as first, then Neutral as second if the citation is mentioned in a descriptive way. But the sentence is contrasting results, so Neutral isn't correct. 

This is confusing. Let me re-express the passage: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." 

This is a direct comparison between the current results and those from the cited work. So CoCoRes is definitely the primary class. 

Are there any other classes? Maybe the citation is also providing context for the current study, but that would be Basis. However, Basis is when the cited work is foundational. Here, it's contrasting results, so Basis isn't right. 

Another possibility is Support, but Support is when the citation supports the current work. Here, they're showing a difference, so Support isn't applicable. 

Motivation would be if the cited work's results motivated the current study, but the sentence is about differing results. 

Therefore, the top three classes are CoCoRes as first, and perhaps Neutral and CoCoXY as second and third, but neither seem to fit. Maybe the example given in the instructions for CoCoRes is the only applicable one, so the top three would be CoCoRes first, Neutral second, and CoCoXY third. But why Neutral? 

Wait, maybe the citation is used descriptively here. For example, mentioning the cited work's results without directly comparing. But the sentence explicitly says "substantially differ," which is a direct comparison. 

Therefore, the correct answer should be CoCoRes as first. The other two classes might not be applicable, but since the task requires three, perhaps Neutral is the second and CoCoXY is third. However, CoCoXY is for comparing two cited studies. 

Alternatively, maybe the citation is used to compare the cited work's results with the current work's results, which is CoCoRes. There's no other comparison here. So perhaps the top three are CoCoRes, Neutral, and something else. 

But Neutral would be if the citation is just mentioned without any comparison. Since the citation is part of a comparison, Neutral isn't correct. 

This is challenging. Given the example provided in the instructions matches the given passage exactly, the correct class is CoCoRes. The other two might be Neutral and CoCoXY, but I'm not sure. Maybe the correct answer is CoCoRes as first, then maybe CoCoXY if there's an indirect comparison between two studies mentioned, but the passage only mentions one. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is CoCoRes first, then Neutral second, and Weakness third. But Weakness isn't applicable here. 

I think the correct answer is CoCoRes as the primary class. The other two classes might not be applicable, but the task requires three. Perhaps Neutral is the second if the citation is mentioned in a neutral way, but the sentence is comparative. 

Given the example in the instructions, the answer is CoCoRes first. For the other two, maybe Neutral and CoCoXY, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the answer is CoCoRes, then Basis if the cited work is foundational. But Basis is when the cited work is foundational, which isn't the case here. 

Hmm. Given the strict instructions and the example provided, the correct answer is CoCoRes as the top class. The other two classes might be Neutral and CoCoXY, but since the passage doesn't compare two cited studies, CoCoXY isn't applicable. Therefore, perhaps Neutral is the second class. 

But Neutral is when the citation is used descriptively. Since the citation is part of a comparison, Neutral isn't correct. 

I'm stuck. Maybe the correct answer is CoCoRes first, then maybe Basis and then something else. But Basis isn't correct here. 

Given the example in the instructions matches the passage exactly, the correct answer is CoCoRes as first. The other two classes might not be applicable, but since the task requires three, perhaps Neutral and CoCoXY are forced in as second and third. But I'm not confident. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is CoCoRes first, then maybe Support and then Neutral. But Support isn't correct here. 

I think the correct answer is CoCoRes as the primary class. The other two classes might not be applicable, but since the task requires three, perhaps Neutral and CoCoXY are included. 

Final answer: 

1. CoCoRes  
2. Neutral  
3. CoCoXY
