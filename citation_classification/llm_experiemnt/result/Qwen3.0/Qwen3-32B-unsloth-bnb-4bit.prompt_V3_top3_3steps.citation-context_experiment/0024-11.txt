Okay, let's start by looking at the citation passage provided. The user wants me to classify the rhetorical class of the citation marked @@CITATION@@.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The sentence is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@."

The key part here is that the authors are comparing their results with those from the cited work. The phrase "substantially differ" indicates a direct comparison of results. According to the definitions, CoCoRes is used when the citation is comparing or contrasting results or findings. That seems like the primary class here.

Next, I should check if there's any secondary classification. The comparison is between the current work and the cited study, not between two cited studies. So CoCoXY isn't applicable here. There's no mention of goals or methods, so CoCoGM is out. The citation isn't supporting the current work's claims, so Support isn't right either. The context isn't neutral because it's actively contrasting results. 

Looking at the other options, there's no motivation or future work mentioned. The citation isn't used to justify the current research or suggest future directions. It's purely about contrasting results. 

So the top class is definitely CoCoRes. For the second and third, maybe Neutral if there's any descriptive aspect, but the sentence is more about comparison. Wait, the example for CoCoRes includes a direct comparison of results, which matches here. The third class could be Neutral if there's a neutral mention elsewhere, but in this case, the entire sentence is about the comparison. Maybe there's no other class applicable. Let me check the example again. The example given for CoCoRes is similar: comparing results. So the primary is CoCoRes, then perhaps Neutral if there's any descriptive part. Wait, the sentence itself is a direct comparison, so Neutral isn't the case. Maybe the third could be something else. Wait, maybe the citation is being used in a neutral way here? No, because Neutral is when it's descriptive without supporting, comparing, etc. But here, it's a comparison. Hmm. Maybe the third is Neutral if there's a neutral part elsewhere. Wait, the example provided for Neutral is when it's just stating facts without argument. Since this is a comparison, Neutral isn't applicable. So the top three would be CoCoRes, then maybe CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two cited studies, but in this case, the comparison is between the current work and the cited study. Therefore, CoCoRes is first, then maybe Neutral isn't right. Wait, maybe there's no third class applicable here beyond CoCoRes. But the task requires three classes. Hmm. Maybe the second could be Neutral if the citation is also being used descriptively. Wait, the sentence is stating that their results differ from the cited work's results. That's a direct comparison, so CoCoRes is first. The third might be Neutral if there's any other neutral mention, but perhaps there isn't. Alternatively, maybe the third is Basis if the cited work is foundational. But the example for Basis is when the cited work introduces a method. Here, the cited work's results are being compared, so Basis isn't applicable. Therefore, the top three would be CoCoRes as first, then maybe Neutral as second if there's a neutral part, but I don't see it. Alternatively, maybe Weakness if the cited work's results are considered flawed. But the sentence says "substantially differ," not necessarily that the cited work is wrong. So Weakness isn't right. Hmm. Maybe the third is Neutral. Wait, the example for Neutral is when it's just stating a fact without argument. In this case, the citation is part of a comparison, so Neutral isn't the right class. Maybe the third is Basis if the cited work is foundational, but that's not the case here. Alternatively, maybe the third is CoCoXY if it's comparing two cited studies, but here it's the current work and the cited study. So perhaps CoCoRes is the only applicable class, but the task requires three. Wait, maybe I missed something. Let me recheck the definitions. The example for CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies with each other, not with the citing paper. In the given example, the sentence compares the current work's results with the cited study's results. So CoCoRes is correct. The third could be Neutral if the citation is used in a neutral way elsewhere, but in this case, the entire sentence is about comparison. Maybe the third is CoCoGM if there's a mention of goals or methods. Wait, the example for CoCoGM is comparing goals or methods. The given sentence is about results, so CoCoRes is correct. Therefore, the top three are CoCoRes as first. For the second and third, perhaps Neutral if there's a neutral part. Wait, maybe the third is Neutral because the citation is just being referenced without any argument beyond the comparison. But Neutral is when it's descriptive without supporting, comparing, etc. Since the citation is used to compare results, Neutral isn't applicable. Hmm. Maybe the third is CoCoXY if there's another comparison, but there isn't. I think the correct answer is CoCoRes as the first class, then maybe Neutral as second if forced, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the third is Basis if the cited work is foundational. Wait, the example for Basis is when the cited work introduced a method. Here, the cited work's results are being compared, so Basis isn't right. Therefore, the top three classes are CoCoRes, then maybe Neutral and then something else. Wait, perhaps the third is CoCoGM if there's an implicit comparison of methods. But the sentence doesn't mention methods, only results. Therefore, the correct answer is CoCoRes as first, then maybe Neutral as second and Basis as third if forced, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the third is CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two cited studies. Wait, the example for CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies with each other. In the given example, the comparison is between the current work and the cited study, so CoCoXY isn't applicable. Therefore, the only applicable class is CoCoRes, but the task requires three. Maybe the third is Neutral. Wait, maybe the citation is being used descriptively in a neutral way elsewhere. Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here, but based on the definitions, CoCoRes is definitely first. For the second and third, perhaps Neutral and then something else. Alternatively, maybe the third is CoCoGM or CoCoXY if there's an implicit comparison, but I don't see it. Given the information, I'll go with CoCoRes as first, then maybe Neutral as second and then something else like Basis as third if forced.
