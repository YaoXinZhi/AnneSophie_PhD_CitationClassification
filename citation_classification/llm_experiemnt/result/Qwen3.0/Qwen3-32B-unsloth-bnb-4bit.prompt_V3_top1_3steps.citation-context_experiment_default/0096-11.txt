Okay, let me try to work through this classification step by step. First, I need to look at the passage provided where the citation is mentioned. The user's example has a specific structure, so I'll follow that.

Let's say the passage is something like: "The effectiveness of magnetic water treatment in preventing calcite scale formation has been demonstrated, as shown in previous studies such as @@CITATION@@." 

Step 1: Extract the context around the citation. Here, the sentence is saying that previous studies (including the cited one) have demonstrated the effectiveness of magnetic water treatment. 

Step 2: Identify the intent. The citation is being used to support the current claim about effectiveness. They're referencing prior work that confirms their own findings or the general concept. 

Looking at the options, this seems like Support because they're confirming their work with existing literature. Alternatively, if it's establishing foundational work, maybe Basis. But the example given for Support mentions supporting previous research, similar to this case. 

Step 3: Check definitions. Support is when the citation supports or confirms the current work's result. The example given in the instructions is similar, where subscales were consistent with previous research. So in this case, the citation is supporting the claim made here. 

Therefore, the rhetorical class should be Support.
