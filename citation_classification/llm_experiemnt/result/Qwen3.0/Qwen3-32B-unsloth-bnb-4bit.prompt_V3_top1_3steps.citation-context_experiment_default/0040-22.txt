Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user provided a context where they need to classify a citation in a scientific article about plant health. The task is to assign the citation to one of the predefined rhetorical classes based on the given definitions and examples.

First, I need to extract the context discussing the @@CITATION@@. The citation is mentioned in the passage: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." So the context here is comparing the results of the current study with those from a previous experiment using deuterium targets.

Next, identifying the general intent. The key phrase is "substantially differ from the results," indicating a direct comparison of findings between the current work and the cited study. According to the guidelines, this falls under Comparative, specifically looking at results comparison.

Now, selecting the specific rhetorical class. The example for CoCoRes states it's when results are directly compared. The example given is very similar to the context provided here, both mentioning differing results between present work and the cited paper. Therefore, the correct class here should be CoCoRes.
