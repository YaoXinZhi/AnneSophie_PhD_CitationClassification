Okay, let's start by looking at the user's query and the citation passage provided. My task is to classify the role of the '@@CITATION@@' in the given passage according to the predefined rhetorical classes.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions comparing different studies: "However, other studies reported opposite findings in various fungal species using different experimental approaches@@CITATION@@" and "These contradictory results were also observed in other fungal pathosystems@@CITATION@@".

Next, I identify the general intent. The citation here seems to be part of a comparison between studies that have conflicting results. The authors are pointing out that different studies have found opposite outcomes, and the citation is used to highlight this contradiction. The key term here is "contradictory results," which points towards a comparative analysis between studies.

Looking at the categories, CoCoXY is defined as comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies, not necessarily with the citing paper. Here, the authors mention "contradictory results" across different studies and use the citation to reference one of those studies in the context of comparison with others. This fits CoCoXY as the authors are contrasting the cited work's findings with others mentioned (e.g., "different fungal species", "other fungal pathosystems") to show conflicting results, even though the current paper isn't directly compared here. Thus, the most appropriate label is CoCoXY.
