Okay, let's tackle this classification problem step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the @@CITATION@@ in the provided passage. The passage is talking about a study that describes the transmission of a plant disease caused by bacteria in certain plants. The specific part with the citation mentions conflicting results related to a phytoplasma strain in a different plant species. 

So, the context is comparing findings between two studies: Wei et al., 2004; Saracco et al., 2006, which reported high concentrations of phytoplasma strains in some plants, versus the cited work (@@CITATION@@) which reported conflicting results in another plant species. The key here is that the citation is being used to highlight a difference in results between two studies.

Next, I need to determine the general intent. Since the example given under CoCoRes involves comparing experimental results and pointing out discrepancies, this seems similar. The cited work is contrasted with previous studies, indicating that their results are conflicting.

Looking at the definitions again, CoCoRes is when the citation is comparing the cited work's results with those of the citing paper or other studies. In this case, the citation is comparing results of the cited study (which found conflicting results) with the previous studies. Therefore, the rhetorical class here is CoCoRes.
