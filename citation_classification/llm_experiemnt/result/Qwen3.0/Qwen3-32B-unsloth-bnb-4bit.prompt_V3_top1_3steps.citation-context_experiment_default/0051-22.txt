Okay, let's tackle this classification task step by step. The user provided a scientific passage with a citation and wants me to determine its rhetorical class from the given list.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage is: “@@CITATION@@ developed a method to identify pathogen resistance genes through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in crop species.” The context here is that the cited work created a method for finding resistance genes using GWAS in crops.

Next, figure out the general intent. The current research mentions that they are using this method. The key phrase here is “developed a method,” which suggests that the cited work's method is being referenced. The citing paper isn't comparing results or critiquing the method but is likely referencing it as a tool they are using. 

Looking at the options, "Usage" refers to citing a method, tool, etc., used in the current study. The example given for Usage mentions an experimental setup described in a previous study. The example aligns because here they mention a method developed by the cited work (GWAS method) which the current study might be employing. 

So, the specific class here would be "Usage" since the citation is directly referencing a method used in their research.
