Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to look at the given passage and identify the context around the @@CITATION@@. The passage is:

"The use of systemic acquired resistance (SAR) inducers such as acibenzolar-S-methyl (ASM) has been shown to effectively manage plant diseases caused by various pathogens @@CITATION@@."

Step 1: Extracting the context. The sentence is stating that SAR inducers like ASM manage plant diseases caused by various pathogens, and then cites a source. The citation here is directly supporting the claim made in the preceding text. The authors are using the citation to back up their assertion about the effectiveness of SAR inducers.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation isn't introducing a new method or comparing with another study's results. Instead, it's being used to confirm that the use of SAR inducers is effective against plant pathogens. That makes me think the intent here is to support their statement with existing research.

Step 3: Assigning the specific rhetorical class. Looking at the definitions, 'Support' is where the citation is used to support or confirm the work, result, or finding. The example given under Support is when the subscales are consistent with previous research, similar to how the citation here is confirming the effectiveness of SAR inducers. So the label should be 'Support'.
