Okay, let me try to figure this out. The input is a scientific article passage where I need to classify a citation. The passage mentions a study by @@CITATION@@ reporting that the transcript levels of a certain gene were similar in leaves with and without phytoplasma infection. Let's go through the steps.

First, extract the context around the citation. The full sentence is: "In contrast, transcript levels of a gene showed similar gene expression levels in leaves with and without infection (Figure 4), a result not reported previously (Kubes et al., ...). Therefore, the regulation mechanism... may have differences." The citation here is Kubes et al., which is mentioned as not having reported this result before.

Next, identify the intent. The current paper's authors note that their result (similar transcript levels in infected vs non-infected leaves) hasn't been previously reported. The citation to Kubes et al. is used to show contrast or highlight a novelty in their findings. But wait, the cited work says they didn't report it. So the citation is pointing out that prior studies (like Kubes) didn't find this, so the current study's finding is new. 

Looking at the categories, this could fall under 'Support' or 'Similar'? Wait, the citation is contrasting with the current result. The current study's result wasn't reported in Kubes, so it's a comparison of results, maybe CoCoRes? Because they are comparing findings. The example given for CoCoRes is when results are compared between works. Here, the cited study (Kubes) did not report this specific result, so the authors are contrasting their findings. That seems similar to CoCoRes, where findings are compared. Let me check the CoCoRes example again: "results obtained... differ from..." In this case, the difference is that Kubes didn't find the result, but the current study did. So that's a comparison of results. Hence, CoCoRes.

Alternatively, could it be 'Support'? But Support is when the citation backs up the current findings. Here, the citation is contrasting because it's saying others didn't find it. So Support is less likely. Neutral? Not really, since it's using the citation to highlight a difference. Weakness? They might not be criticizing the cited work but just stating a contrast in results, which is more neutral comparison. So CoCoRes fits best as comparing their results to Kubes'.
