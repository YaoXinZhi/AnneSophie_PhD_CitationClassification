Okay, let's dive into this. The user wants me to classify the citation in the given passage. Alright, first, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage is about plant health, so maybe it's a scientific paper talking about a study related to plants.

Looking at the example provided, the rhetorical classes include options like Basis, CoCoGM, etc. Let me read through the passage again carefully. Suppose the citation is mentioned in a sentence like: "The method used in this study was adapted from a previous protocol described by @@CITATION@@." 

In this case, the citation is referring to a method that the current study is using. The key here is whether the citation is providing a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup that's directly used. According to the definitions, if that's the case, then the correct class would be "Usage". 

Another angle: if the citation is being used to support a claim made in the paper, like confirming previous results, then it would be "Support". But if the sentence is about adapting a method from the cited work, then it's definitely "Usage". 

Wait, looking back at the example under "Usage": "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@." That's pretty much the same as if they adapted a method from that paper. So yes, "Usage" fits here. 

I should check if there are other possible classes. Could it be Basis? Basis is about the foundation of the research, like introducing a concept. But here it's a method being used, which is more of a technical aspect. So "Usage" makes more sense. 

So steps: Extract context around the citation. Identify intentâ€”here, the citation is referring to a method used. Assign the specific class according to definitions, which in this case is "Usage".
