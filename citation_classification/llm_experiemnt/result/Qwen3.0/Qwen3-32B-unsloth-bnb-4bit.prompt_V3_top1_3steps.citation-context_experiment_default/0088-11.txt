Okay, let's see. I need to determine the rhetorical class for the given citation in the context provided. The context is: "The first report of leafspot on red raspberry caused by Diaporthe gulyae was found in the Pacific Northwest regions of Washington State in 2007. @@CITATION@@ is cited as the first report of the pathogen on the crop in other regions." 

First, step 1 is to extract the context discussing the citation. So the sentence here mentions that the citation is about the first report of the pathogen on the crop in other regions. The citation follows a statement about the initial report in 2007 in Washington State.

Step 2 is to identify the general intent. Here, the citation is being used to provide support that the pathogen was reported in other regions after its initial discovery. They're citing another's work to confirm or support their own assertion. The example given under 'Support' says the citation supports the authors' findings. In this case, the citing authors are stating that the pathogen was found elsewhere, and the citation serves to back up that claim. 

Looking at the definitions, 'Support' is when the citation is used to support the citing authors' work, result, or finding. This seems to fit because the citation is referenced as a source supporting the claim that it's the first report in other regions. There's no comparison, criticism, motivation, etc., here. 

Step 3 would then select 'Support' as the rhetorical class because the citation is cited to support the assertion made by the authors about subsequent reports in other areas.
