Okay, let me try to work through this step by step. The user provided a citation in a scientific article passage and wants me to assign the correct rhetorical class.

First, the context around the citation mentions "Our results align with previous findings on the impact of climate change in agricultural systems (Gibson et al., @@CITATION@@)." So the key part here is "align with previous findings," which suggests that the citation is being used to support the current study's results by reference to prior work.

Looking at the task breakdown, Step 2 involves determining the general intent. The phrase "align with" implies a supportive relationship between the cited work and the current one. Comparing to the definitions, "Support" is used when the citation confirms the work, results, or findings of the citing authors. The example given under "Support" mentions consistency with previous research using a U.S. sample, which mirrors this alignment scenario here.

Now, Step 3 requires choosing the specific label. The options here include "Support" and possibly others like "Similar" or "CoCoRes." "Similar" would indicate pointing out similarities between cited work and the current paper. However, in this case, the authors are saying their results align with previous findings without necessarily stating similarity in terms of phenomena or observations. Instead, they're confirming that their findings are consistent with existing research, which fits better under "Support."

Also, "CoCoRes" (Comparison of Results) might seem plausible, but that's when there's a direct comparison or contrast between the results of cited work and the current paper. Here, the focus is on alignment rather than a direct comparison, so it's more about supporting the current findings with prior ones. 

Therefore, the correct classification here should be "Support."
