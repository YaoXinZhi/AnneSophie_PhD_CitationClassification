Okay, I need to figure out the rhetorical class for this citation. Let's look at the example provided for each class to match the context.

The given example is for 'Usage': “The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@.” The context here indicates that the method or setup from the cited work is being reused.

Now considering the definitions, 'Usage' refers to when the cited work's method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup is directly used. In the example, the setup is used as a reference, so the label is 'Usage'.

Therefore, the correct label here is 'Usage'.
