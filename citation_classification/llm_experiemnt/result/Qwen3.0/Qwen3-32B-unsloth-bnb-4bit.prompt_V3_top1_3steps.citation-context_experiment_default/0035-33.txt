Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the task is to determine the rhetorical class for a citation in a scientific article about plant health. The citation is marked as @@CITATION@@ here.

First, I need to look at the context around the citation. The passage provided is:

"We evaluated the effect of different fungicides on disease incidence and severity in a greenhouse experiment. Disease symptoms were scored according to the method described by @@CITATION@@."

Step 1: Extracting the relevant context. The citation is mentioned in the context of describing how disease symptoms were scored. The key here is that the cited work's method is being referenced for scoring symptoms.

Step 2: General intent. The authors are using the citation to indicate that they followed a specific method described by another study. This seems like they're supporting their methodology by referencing an existing method. According to the definitions, Support is when the citation supports or confirms the work, result, or finding of the citing authors. Alternatively, Usage would be if they're directly using a method, tool, etc. from the cited work. 

In the example provided under "Support," they mention that a subscale was consistent with previous research, referencing the cited work. In this case, the authors are using the method from @@CITATION@@ to score symptoms, which aligns with supporting their approach by confirming it's a standard or previously used method. So maybe it's Support. 

But "Usage" refers to directly using a method, tool, etc. The example under "Usage" says: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously [citation]." Here, the authors describe their scoring method as following [citation], so they are using the method from the cited work. That seems like Usage. Wait, but the example under Support mentions consistency with previous research, using the cited work to back up their findings. The difference between Support and Usage can be tricky. 

Support is when they use the citation to support their claim or confirm their findings. Usage is when they actually use the method or tool from the cited work. In this case, the citation is referencing the method they used for scoring symptoms. So if they are applying that method in their study, that would fall under Usage because they are employing the method from the cited work. 

Looking back at the example under Usage: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously [citation]." Here, the setup is from the cited work. Similarly, in our case, the scoring method is from the cited work. So the rhetorical class should be "Usage."
