Okay, let's see. I need to determine the rhetorical class of the citation in this plant health article passage. The task is to look at the context around the @@CITATION@@ and figure out why it's there. First step is extracting the relevant context.

The passage says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." So the key part here is "substantially differ from the results" followed by a citation. 

Now, moving to step two, identifying the general intent. The paper is comparing their results to previous experiments. The difference is highlighted, so this is a comparison of results. Looking at the definitions, CoCoRes is when the citation is used to compare or contrast results or findings. 

The example given for CoCoRes is similar: comparing results from their work with cited experiments. The example mentions substantial differences, just like the current case. So the intent here is clearly a comparison of results. 

Step three is selecting the specific class. Since it's a direct comparison of results between the current work and the cited paper, the correct label should be CoCoRes.
