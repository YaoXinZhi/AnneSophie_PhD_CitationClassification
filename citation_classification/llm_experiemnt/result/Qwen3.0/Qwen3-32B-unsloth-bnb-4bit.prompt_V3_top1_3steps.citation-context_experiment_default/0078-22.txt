Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to look at the citation context provided. The passage mentions that the results of a new method are compared to those obtained with an older method. The specific part with the citation is talking about "results obtained with another method described previously (Ref. 1) were lower than..." which contrasts the current findings with those from the cited reference.

So, step one is to extract the relevant context. The key part is the comparison between the results of the current study and the previous method's results. 

Next, identifying the intent. The authors are directly comparing their results with another study's results to highlight differences. From the step-by-step guide, this falls under comparative intent, specifically about comparing results. 

Now, the rhetorical classes for comparative intent are CoCoGM, CoCoRes, or CoCoXY. Since the comparison here is between the cited work's results and the current paper's results, that points to CoCoRes, which isComparison of Results. The example given in CoCoRes mentions contrasting results, which aligns with the citation usage here. Therefore, the correct class should be CoCoRes.
