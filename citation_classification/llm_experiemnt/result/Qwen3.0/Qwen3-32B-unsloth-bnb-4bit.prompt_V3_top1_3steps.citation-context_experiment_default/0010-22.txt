Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in the given passage. First, I should extract the context around the citation. The citation here is from Ritz et al., 2011. The surrounding text says, "The effect ... was confirmed by studies on the uptake of different nutrients into root cells of different plants, which also showed no correlation between uptake and the magnetic water treatment applied @@CITATION@."

So, the authors are talking about their own findings confirming that magnetic water treatment doesn't correlate with nutrient uptake. Then they mention that another study also found the same thing. The citation is used to back up their claim with someone else's research. 

Looking at the rhetorical classes: Support is for when the citation supports the work or findings of the citing authors. The example given for Support is when they say something like "consistent with previous research" and cite someone. In this case, the authors are confirming their results (no correlation) and citing Ritz et al., so they're supporting their own conclusion with another study's result. 

Other possibilities might be Similar, but the example there is more about findings matching across studies. Wait, the example for Similar is "our finding..." is supported by another study's results. Hmm, but the example for Support is when the citing paper's results are consistent with previous research. 

Wait, in the example for Support: "All subscales were consistent with previous research..." So Support is when the citation is used to support the authors' own work, maybe by showing previous research aligns with them. In this case, the authors are confirming their findings (no correlation between magnetic treatment and uptake) with the cited study. That sounds like Support because they're using the citation to back up their own conclusion. 

So I think the correct class here is Support.
