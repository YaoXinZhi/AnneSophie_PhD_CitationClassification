Okay, I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation here. Let me look at the passage again. The user pasted a citation, and I need to determine the class based on the context around it.

First, I'll step back and read through the passage to understand the context. The sentence mentions that the @@CITATION@@ described conflicting results for a phytoplasma strain in Euphorlia pulcherrima versus two other strains. The authors are comparing these two studies. 

So, looking at Step 1: Extract the context discussing the citation. The key part is "conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima @@CITATION@@." 

Step 2: Identify the intent. Here, they're pointing out conflicting findings between two studies. That sounds like a comparison of results or explanations. The example given for CoCoRes mentions comparing results of cited work with the current paper, but here it seems like they're comparing multiple cited studies against each other. The example for CoCoXY mentions comparing two cited studies. 

In the example for CoCoXY, they cited Wei et al. and Saracco et al., then referenced another citation for conflicting results in Euphorbia. The current example is similar. So the citation here is used to contrast two phytoplasma studies. 

Therefore, Step 3: The correct class should be CoCoXY because it's comparing explanations or claims between the cited works (CoCoXY is comparison of explanations or claims, not with the current paper but between two cited studies). 

Checking the definitions again: CoCoXY is when comparing two cited studies. The example given in CoCoXY is conflicting results between two phytoplasma strains. So yes, this matches CoCoXY.
