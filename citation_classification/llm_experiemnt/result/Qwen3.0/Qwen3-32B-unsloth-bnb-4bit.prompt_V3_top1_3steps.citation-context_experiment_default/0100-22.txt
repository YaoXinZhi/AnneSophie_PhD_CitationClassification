Okay, let's see. The task is to classify the citation in the given passage into one of the specified rhetorical classes. First, I need to understand the context where the citation is placed.

Looking at the example provided, the relevant sentence is: "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly (Table 3, Figure 4) is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@."

Wait, the actual citation passage provided is:

```
The application of RNA-Seq technology allows the identification and characterization of full-length transcripts of both coding and non-coding RNAs in species where genome sequences are not available or incomplete @@CITATION@@. The present study applied this method to investigate the transcriptomes of roots, shoots and nematodes isolated from the roots of two ecologically diverse strains of Rhizomyces diapensii, a root endophyte originally isolated from high alpine and arctic habitats which produces secondary metabolites with bioactive properties against human pathogens.
```

Wait, the citation is placed at the end of the first sentence. The first sentence says that RNA-Seq technology allows identification of full-length transcripts, which is supported by the cited work. The authors are using the cited work as an example of how RNA-Seq is beneficial, which supports their decision to use it in their own study. 

So, the context is that the cited work introduced or demonstrated the use of RNA-Seq technology in certain contexts. The authors of the current paper are stating that they use RNA-Seq because of its advantages highlighted in the cited work. This seems like a Motivation because they're justifying why they're using the method. 

Looking back at the Motivation example: "Our previous research @@CITATION@@ has shown that... The explanation of the phenomena is not yet offered and the purpose of this work is to try to understand..." So, the citation is used to justify why the current research is done. 

In the given case, the citation is used to justify their use of RNA-Seq by highlighting its advantages. Therefore, Motivation seems correct. Alternatively, it could be Basis if it's the foundation, but Basis refers to more foundational theories. 

Wait, Basis is when the cited work is the intellectual foundation. For example, introducing a method. If the cited work introduced RNA-Seq, but the current study is replicating or building on it. However, in the given passage, it's more about supporting the rationale for using RNA-Seq, which would be Motivation. Let me check the example again. The Motivation example's citation is the previous research that shows a phenomenon not fully explained, motivating their study. Similarly, the given citation is showing the benefits of RNA-Seq, motivating their application of it. So Motivation is appropriate.
