Okay, let me tackle this citation classification step by step. 

First, I need to extract the context around the @@CITATION@@. The passage says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." So the key part here is comparing the current study's results to those of the cited work's experiments. 

Next, identifying the general intent. The phrase "substantially differ from the results" indicates a direct comparison of findings between the current paper and the cited one. According to the definitions, this falls under comparative intent when referring to results.

Now, narrowing down to the specific rhetorical class. The example under CoCoRes mentions a comparison of results, which matches this scenario. The example given contrasts results between experiments, similar to our case where the current results differ substantially from those of the cited study. 

I should check if there's a better fit. CoCoGM is about goals or methods, which isn't the case here. CoCoXY compares explanations between cited studies, not relevant since it's the citing paper's results versus the cited ones. Support or Similar wouldn't involve differing results. Weakness would involve criticism, which isn't stated. Neutral is too vague and doesn't involve comparing results. 

Therefore, the correct label should be CoCoRes.
