Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The given passage is: "The impact of magnetic treatment on hard water scaling is a topic of interest in industrial water treatment. Previous studies have shown conflicting results regarding the effectiveness of magnetic water treatment devices. @@CITATION@@ reported a significant reduction in scale formation when magnetic fields were applied to hard water, while another study @@CITATION@@ found no such effect." 

The citation in question is the first one, labeled @@CITATION@@, which reports a significant reduction in scale formation.

Next, identify the general intent. The sentence mentions conflicting results between two studies. The first citation is presented as one study that found a reduction, the other citation found no effect. The author is pointing out a disagreement between these two sets of results. This fits the general intent of Comparative, specifically comparing results. 

Now, looking at the fined-grained classes, CoCoRes is for direct comparison of results. The example given involves contrasting experimental results with those from another study. In this case, the author contrasts their result (no effect) with the cited study's finding (reduction). Thus, this falls under CoCoRes.
