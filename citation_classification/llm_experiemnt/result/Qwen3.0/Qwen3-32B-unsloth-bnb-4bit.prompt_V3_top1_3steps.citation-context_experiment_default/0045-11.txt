Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. The citation is in the passage: `The results from the present study are consistent with those reported by @@CITATION@@, who observed high levels of infection in similar environmental conditions.` 

First, extract the context around the citation. The key part is "consistent with those reported by @@CITATION@@, who observed high levels of infection in similar environmental conditions." The authors are saying their results align with the cited work's findings under similar conditions.

Next, identify the general intent. Since they're stating their results are consistent, this is a supportive intent. Supportive citations either support their own findings or confirm previous results.

Now, determine the specific rhetorical class. The example given for 'Support' mentions confirming the work of others. Here, the current study's results are consistent with the cited work, which matches the 'Support' class definition. They're using the citation to back up their own findings by showing alignment with prior research. 

It's not 'Similar' because the example for 'Similar' talks about pointing out similarities in phenomena, but here they are aligning their results directly with the cited results. Also, no criticism or comparison with methods or goals, so 'CoCoRes' isn't fitting either. 'Support' is the best fit here.
