Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to classify the citation in the given passage based on the predefined rhetorical classes. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage is about identifying the causal agent of an oak yellows-like disease in apricot trees. The citation is introduced as having described phytoplasma in the same trees and providing serological characterization. The authors state they conducted PCR amplification and sequencing, comparing their results with the cited work's findings.

Next, determine the intent. The citation here is to compare resultsâ€”specifically, the PCR and sequencing outcomes with the previous serological characterization. They're contrasting their findings with what was previously established by the cited authors. The example given in CoCoRes is about comparing results between a current study and a cited one, which aligns with this scenario. 

The comparison here isn't between two cited studies (CoCoXY) nor methods or goals (CoCoGM). It's direct results comparison. Also, it's not supporting the current work's validity but showing consistency. Therefore, the most fitting class is CoCoRes.
