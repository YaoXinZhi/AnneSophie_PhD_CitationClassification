Okay, let's tackle this citation classification step by step. The given passage is: 

"The experimental setup used 16 individuals from the lab-cultured reference strain, N. bicaudus B3, as described elsewhere @@CITATION@@."

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The key part here is that they're referencing where the experimental setup for the lab-cultured strain was described. The authors are pointing to another source for the setup details.

Next, determining the intent. Since they're directing readers to a previous description of the setup, it's about the method or procedure used. The citation is providing the source of the experimental setup, which is a technical reference. 

Looking at the classes, "Usage" refers to when a method, tool, or setup from the cited work is directly used. Here, the setup was described in the cited paper, so the authors are using that existing setup in their current study. That fits "Usage".

No comparison or support is happening here; it's just referencing where the setup was detailed. So the correct class is Usage.
