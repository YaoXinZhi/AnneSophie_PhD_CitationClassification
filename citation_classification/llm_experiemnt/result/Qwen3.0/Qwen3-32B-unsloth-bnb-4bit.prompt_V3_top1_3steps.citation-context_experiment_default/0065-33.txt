Okay, let's see. I need to classify the citation in the given passage. The user provided the context and instructions on how to approach this. The citation is enclosed in @@CITATION@@, so I first need to look at the surrounding text to understand how it's used.

Looking at the passage: "The use of @@CITATION@@ allowed the authors to identify the pathogen with high accuracy."

Hmm. The phrase "allowed the authors to identify" suggests that the cited work provided a method or tool that was utilized. The key here is the action of allowing something, which is facilitated by the cited study. According to the definitions, 'Usage' is when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup directly used in the current study. The example given for 'Usage' says, “The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@.” So here, the method or setup from the cited paper was used.

In the context provided, the citation is about something that allowed identification with high accuracy, implying they used the method from that citation. Therefore, the rhetorical class should be 'Usage'.
