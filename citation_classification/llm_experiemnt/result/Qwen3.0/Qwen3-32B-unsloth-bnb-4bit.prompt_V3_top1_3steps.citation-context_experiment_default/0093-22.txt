Okay, let's start with the given context. The passage mentions, "[...] the resistance conferred by the transgenic lines overexpressing WRKY3 was lower than those of plants transformed with the corresponding constructs in the wild-type background [...] this is consistent with previous reports of WRKY-type transcription factors in plants @@CITATION@." 

In step one, I extract the relevant context around the citation. The key part is "this is consistent with previous reports of WRKY-type transcription factors in plants @@CITATION@". So, the authors are stating that their observation aligns with what was previously found in other studies regarding WRKY-type transcription factors.

Moving to step two, identifying the general intent. Since they mention consistency with previous reports, the citation is reinforcing their findings with prior research. That sounds like a supportive intent, where they back up their conclusion using another source.

Step three involves choosing the specific rhetorical class. The definition of 'Support' includes using a citation to confirm the work's findings. The example given in the instructions matches closely: confirming subscales with prior research using a U.S. sample. In this case, the cited work supports the current authors' finding about WRKY-type transcription factors.

Therefore, the rhetorical class here should be 'Support'.
