Okay, let's see. The user provided a passage with a citation marked as @@CITATION@@. I need to figure out the rhetorical class for this citation. 

First, I'll start by looking at the exact sentence around the citation. The passage is: "The role of biological control agents in managing plant pathogens has been increasingly recognized. For example, @@CITATION@@ demonstrated the effectiveness of Trichoderma species in suppressing soilborne diseases in greenhouse conditions." 

So the citation here is used to provide an example of a study that showed Trichoderma species effectiveness. Let me break this down. The first part talks about the recognition of biological control agents. Then the citation is given as an example demonstrating effectiveness. 

Now, applying the step-by-step guidelines. 

Step 1: Extract the context around the citation. The context here is the sentence stating that the cited work demonstrated effectiveness. 

Step 2: Identify the intent. The intent seems to be supporting the general statement about the role of biological control agents by providing evidence. The citation is used to support the claim made in the sentence. The example provided by the citation backs up the assertion that biological control agents are effective. 

Looking at the options, Support is when the citation is used to support or confirm the citing paper's work or results. In this case, the authors are supporting their statement with the cited study's results. 

Is there any other possible class? Could it be Similar? But "Similar" refers to similarity between the cited work and the citing paper's findings. Here, it's more about providing an example as evidence, hence Support fits better. 

Also, not Comparative or Motivation. Future doesn't fit. Usage isn't relevant here. Weakness or CoCoXY also don't apply. Neutral would be if it's just stating facts, but the intent is to support their argument. 

So the correct label is Support.
