Okay, let's tackle this. The task is to classify the rhetorical class of the citation in the given passage. First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage provided is:

"@@CITATION@@ developed a rapid detection method for Phytophthora lateralis using real-time PCR. This approach was chosen over traditional methods due to its higher sensitivity and specificity, which are critical for early pathogen detection."

Step 1: Extract the useful context. The key part is that the authors reference a method developed by @@CITATION@@ using real-time PCR and state why they chose this methodâ€”higher sensitivity and specificity for early detection.

Step 2: Determine the general intent. The citation here is explaining why they used this particular method over traditional ones, highlighting the cited work's contributions as foundational in their choice. It seems like they're establishing the basis of their methodology on previous work.

Step 3: Assigning the class. The example for Basis mentions introducing a method. Here, the citation is about the intellectual foundation they're building upon, which fits Basis. It's not comparing results or methods directly but justifying their approach by referring to existing validated work. So Basis seems right.
