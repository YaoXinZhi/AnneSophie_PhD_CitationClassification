Okay, let's see what I need to do here. The task is to classify the rhetorical class of a citation in a scientific article passage related to plant health. The user has provided a passage with a citation marker @@CITATION@@, and I need to determine the correct class from the given list.

First, I'll start by step 1, which is extracting the context around the citation. Let me look at the example passage again:

```
The presence of Ca. Phytoplasma mali has been reported in multiple plant species associated with pear decline and related diseases worldwide @@CITATION@@.
```

The context here is about reporting the presence of Ca. Phytoplasma mali in various plants linked to pear decline and related diseases globally. The citation is used to support this statement.

Moving to step 2, identifying the general intent. The surrounding text is stating a fact and citing a source that provides evidence or reports this presence. The sentence isn't comparing methods, results, or explanationsâ€”it's simply confirming or citing where the information comes from. The example given for Support mentions supporting or confirming the work of the authors through cited sources. In this case, the citation is used to back up the claim made in the sentence about the presence of the pathogen. 

Looking at the possible classes, the Support category fits here because the citation is supporting the claim. The example given under Support says when the cited work supports or confirms the citing authors' findings. Here, the authors are stating a fact and using the citation to confirm it. 

I should check if any other classes might fit. For instance, Basis would be if the citation is foundational for the research, but the example there refers to introducing a method or concept. Motivation might be if the citation is used to justify why the research is done, but the passage is more about existing findings rather than motivating new research. Similarly, Basis, CoCo types, Future, or Weakness don't seem to apply here. Neutral would be if it's just a neutral description, but here the citation is actively supporting the statement. 

Therefore, step 3 would select Support as the class.
