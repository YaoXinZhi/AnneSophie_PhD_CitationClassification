Okay, let's start by looking at the given passage. The user wants me to classify the rhetorical class of the citation marked as @@CITATION@@. 

First step is to extract the context around the citation. The passage says: “The use of biological control agents has been widely tested for the management of plant pathogenic nematodes. For example, the application of Pasteuria species as biocontrol agents is discussed in @@CITATION@@.”

So the context mentions that the paper discusses the application of Pasteuria species as biocontrol agents. The surrounding sentence is a general statement about biological control agents being widely tested, and the citation is providing an example of a specific study on that topic.

Next, I need to identify the general intent. The citation is used here to exemplify the use of a specific biological control agent. It's supporting the claim that such agents have been widely tested by citing a specific case (Pasteuria species). 

Looking at the classification options, Support seems like a good fit because the citation is used to support or confirm the work's claims in the citing paper. In the definition examples, a supportive citation is one that supports or confirms the work of the authors. Here, the citation is backing up the statement that the use is being tested by referencing a study where it was discussed.

I should check if any other class might also fit. Could it be Basis? Basis is about the intellectual foundation. But here, it's more of an example supporting the general statement. CoCo classes involve comparing results, methods, explanations. The passage isn't comparing but giving an example. Motivation or Future aren't there. Usage isn't relevant here either. Weakness and Neutral also don't fit because there's a clear supportive intent. So Support is the most accurate label.
