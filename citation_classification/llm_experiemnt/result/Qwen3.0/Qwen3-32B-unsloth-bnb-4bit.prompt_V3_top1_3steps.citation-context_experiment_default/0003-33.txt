Okay, let me start by looking at the given passage and the citation mention. The passage says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The key part here is comparing the results from the present study with those from the cited experiments using deuterium-saturated targets.

Next, identifying the general intent. The phrase "substantially differ" indicates a comparison of results between the current work and the cited study. From the task definitions, comparing results falls under the Comparative category, and the specific class here would be CoCoRes since it's directly contrasting the findings.

Now, checking the examples given for each class. CoCoRes examples involve direct comparison of results, which matches this case. The Basis class is about foundational work, which isn't the case here. Motivation would be about justifying the study, which is not happening here. Support would be confirming results, but here it's contrasting. So the correct label should be CoCoRes.
