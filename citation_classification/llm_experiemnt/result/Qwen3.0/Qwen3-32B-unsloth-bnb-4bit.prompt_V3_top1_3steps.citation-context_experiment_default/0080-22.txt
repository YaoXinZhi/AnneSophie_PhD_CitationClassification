Okay, let me try to figure out this classification. The user provided a context where a scientific article is citing a reference using @@CITATION@@. My job is to determine the correct rhetorical class based on the surrounding text.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. Let's imagine the passage is something like: "Previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of this method in plant disease resistance. For example, @@CITATION@@ showed that plants treated with this approach exhibited significantly reduced symptoms, similar to our findings here."

In Step 1, I focus on the part mentioning the citation. The key part is "showed that plants treated with this approach exhibited significantly reduced symptoms, similar to our findings here." This indicates that the cited work's results are similar to what the current study observed.

Moving to Step 2, the general intent here seems to be supportive. The authors are pointing out a similarity between their results and the cited work's findings. Comparing results to show they align would fall under the Supportive category. Looking at the options, Support or Similar might apply. However, since they specifically reference findings similar to theirs, the Similar class might be more accurate. 

Step 3 requires selecting the specific label. The example for Similar mentions findings being similar between the cited work and the citing paper. The example given is about bacterial community assembly being supported by another study's similar results. The current context also relates findings in a similar manner. Thus, the correct label should be Similar.
