Okay, let me try to work through this step by step. The passage given is:

"To detect pathogen-specific DNA molecules, the authors utilized nested PCR with two different primer sets, one specific for Xf and one universal bacterial primer set targeting the conserved 16S rRNA gene region of Bacteria as previously described by @@CITATION@@."

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The key part is that they're talking about using nested PCR with specific and universal primers. The citation here is referenced as "previously described by @@CITATION@@", which points to where the method was originally detailed.

Next, the general intent of citing this work seems to be to indicate that the method they're using was established by a previous study. Since they're not comparing results, contrasting methods with their own study directly, or supporting their findings with it, it's more about referencing the origin of the method.

Looking at the classifications, the options like Usage might fit if they're applying the method from the cited work. The Usage definition involves referring to a method, tool, etc., which is directly used. Here, they're using a method that was described previously, so the citation's role is to direct readers to where the method was first detailed. 

Wait, but let me check other possibilities. Could it be Basis? Basis is intellectual foundation for the research. But here it's more about a specific method used rather than foundational basis. Support is for confirming findings, which isn't the case here. CoCo classes usually involve comparing with the current paper's goals or results, which isn't happening here either. Neutral is when the citation is mentioned neutrally without specific support or comparison. But the mention is specifically referring to the method being based on previous work. 

Wait, the example for Usage is when a method setup is cited. The example given is "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@." Which is exactly what's happening here. The authors utilized a method described previously, so the citation is pointing to the source of the method they used. So, this would fall under Usage because they are using a method from the cited paper. Therefore, the correct rhetorical class should be Usage.
