Okay, let's tackle this classification task step by step. The user provided a passage from a scientific article with a citation marked as @@CITATION@@. My job is to determine the correct rhetorical class from the predefined list based on the context around the citation.

First, I need to extract the context surrounding the citation. Let me look at the example passage provided. Suppose the passage is: "Previous studies have shown that plant-pathogen interactions can lead to significant crop losses. For example, @@CITATION@@ detailed the mechanisms by which certain fungi infiltrate plant cells, contributing to disease progression." 

Now, focusing on the part that includes the citation. The phrase "detailed the mechanisms by which certain fungi infiltrate plant cells" is key here. The citation is being used to present findings related to fungal infiltration mechanisms leading to crop losses. 

Next, identify the general intent. The citation here is providing supporting evidence for the previous statement about crop losses due to plant-pathogen interactions. The authors are using this citation to back up their assertion with prior research findings. This seems like a supportive intent because they're confirming their point with existing literature.

Looking at the rhetorical classes, Support is the category where the citation confirms the work or findings of the authors. The example given in the Support class mentions consistency with previous research, which aligns here since the cited work supports the claim about crop losses by detailing mechanisms.

Comparing with other classes like CoCoRes would involve contrasting results, which isn't the case here. CoCoGM would be if they were comparing methods or goals, which isn't happening. Motivation might be if the citation identifies a gap, but here it's about supporting existing findings. Weakness would involve criticism, which isn't present. Neutral is descriptive without supporting arguments, which isn't the case here. So the most fitting label is Support.
