Okay, let me see. So the task is to classify the citation in the given passage into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. First, I need to understand the context of the citation.

Looking at the example provided in the instructions and the user's example, let's take the query from Wei et al., where they mention 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' in young leaves and roots of infected daisy plants, comparing conflicting results described by Saracco et al. in a different plant, Euphorbia pulcherrima. The citation is placed where Saracco et al. is referenced alongside Wei et al. 

The user's example describes situations where two studies are cited together, and the citation is used to compare conflicting results between them. The definition given for CoCoXY mentions that it's about comparing or contrasting two cited studies with each other, not the citing paper. In this case, Wei et al. and Saracco et al. are being compared because one reports fast multiplication rates in young parts, while the other describes conflicting results in a different plant species. 

So the intent here isn't about supporting the current study's claims or motivating their research, but rather pointing out a discrepancy between two existing studies. That aligns with CoCoXY because it's contrasting explanations or findings of two cited works themselves. The key here is the "conflicting results" part mentioned in the example. Therefore, the citation to Saracco et al. is part of explaining conflicting findings between their study and another one (Wei et al.). 

This isn't a comparison of methods or goals (CoCoGM), nor is it contrasting results directly with the current study (CoCoRes). It's contrasting between Wei et al. and Saracco et al., which fits CoCoXY.
