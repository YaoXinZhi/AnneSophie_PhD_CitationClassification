Okay, let's start by looking at the passage provided. The citation is placed in the sentence: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The key part here is that the authors are comparing their results with those of another study that used different materials (deuterium saturated metal targets). The phrase "substantially differ" indicates a direct comparison between their findings and the cited work's results.

Next, identifying the general intent. Since the focus is on comparing results between two studies, this falls under a comparative intent. Specifically, the rhetorical class should be CoCoRes because the citation is used to contrast the results of the present work with the cited experiments. The example given for CoCoRes includes comparing results of experiments, which matches this scenario perfectly.

The final step is to assign the specific label. The other classes like CoCoGM or CoCoXY don't fit here because it's about results, not goals/methods or explanations. There's no support, motivation, or criticism involved either. Therefore, the correct label is CoCoRes.
