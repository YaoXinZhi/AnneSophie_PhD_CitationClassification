Okay, let me tackle this classification step by step. The citation is in the passage about controlling pear psyllids using a combination of a synthetic lure and mating disruption pheromone.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The authors mention they tested this combination and found that the synthetic lure alone didn't work, but when combined with the pheromone, it was effective. They reference @@CITATION@@ to note that other studies have also reported the effectiveness of integrating mating disruption with other attractants, specifically mentioning mating disruption systems in cottony cushion scale.

Next, I need to figure out the intent of citing this work. The purpose here seems to be supporting their own findings by showing that other research backs up the integration approach they used. They're not contrasting methods or results here but rather confirming that their method aligns with previous successful approaches.

Looking at the rhetorical classes, Support fits because they're using the citation to confirm their results with existing literature. The example given for Support mentions consistency with previous research, which aligns with this case. Theyâ€™re showing that their findings are in line with what others have found when combining methods. 

So the correct class should be Support.
