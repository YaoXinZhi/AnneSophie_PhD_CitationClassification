Okay, let's start by looking at the passage provided. The citation is placed in the sentence: "In some cases, the disease was identified by symptoms similar to those described by @@CITATION@@." 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The key part here is "symptoms similar to those described by @@CITATION@@". The author is pointing out that their observed disease symptoms resemble those reported in the cited work. 

Next, the intent of the citation seems to be highlighting a similarity between the two sets of symptoms. The word "similar" directly suggests that the cited work's findings are being referenced to show a parallel result. Comparing results is a common reason for citing, so this might be in the Supportive or Similar category.

Looking at the definition of Support, it's when the citation supports or confirms the authors' work. However, in the example given for Similar, the authors point out a similarity in findings. Here, they mention that their findings show similar symptoms as the cited work, which aligns more with the Similar category because the focus is on the similarity rather than supporting their own results through confirmation. 

The example provided for Similar mentions a similarity between bacterial assemblages in different insect hosts, citing another study. In the given sentence, the similarity is about disease symptoms. The rhetorical purpose is to indicate that the cited work observed similar symptoms to what's described here, which fits the Similar class.
