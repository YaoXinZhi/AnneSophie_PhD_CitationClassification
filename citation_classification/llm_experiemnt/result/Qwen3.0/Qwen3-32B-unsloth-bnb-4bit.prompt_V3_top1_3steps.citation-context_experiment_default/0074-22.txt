Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage given is:

"@@CITATION@@ demonstrated the use of magnetic treatment to prevent calcite scale formation on surfaces exposed to hard water."

So the semantic context here is that the cited work showed that magnetic treatment can prevent scale formation. The intent seems to be supportive because the current research is building on or confirming previous findings.

Now, moving to step two: identifying the general intent. The words used are "demonstrated the use," which suggests they're confirming or supporting a result from prior work. That points towards 'Support' since the citation is backing up the authors' work or a known finding.

Next, step three is to select the specific class. Looking at the examples for Support: the example mentions that subscales were consistent with previous research, which is the case here. The cited work's method is being referenced as a basis for confirmation. 

So the most appropriate label here is Support.
