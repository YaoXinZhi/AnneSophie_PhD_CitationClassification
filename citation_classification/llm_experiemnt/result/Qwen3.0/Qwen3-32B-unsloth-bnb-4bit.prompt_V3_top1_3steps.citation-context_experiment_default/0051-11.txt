Okay, let's start by looking at the citation passage provided: 

"To assess the effectiveness of these methods in practice, the proposed methods were compared against those of @@CITATION@@ using the same datasets as those mentioned in section 2. The comparison focuses on precision, recall, and processing speed across five benchmark datasets."

First, I need to extract the context that's relevant for understanding the citation's intent. The key part here is that the authors are comparing their proposed methods against those cited. The comparison is done on specific metrics (precision, recall, processing speed) using the same datasets. This clearly indicates that the purpose is to contrast the methods or their outcomes.

Now, identifying the general intent. Comparing methods falls under the comparative category. According to the definitions given, CoCoGM is for comparing goals or methods, and CoCoRes is for comparing results. Here, the authors mention comparing "the proposed methods" with those of the citation, focusing on metrics. Since they're comparing methods (the approaches) rather than just their results, this seems more aligned with CoCoGM (Comparison of Goals or Methods). 

However, let me double-check. If the comparison was purely about results (like different findings), it would be CoCoRes. But here, it's about the methods themselves being compared with others, possibly to show how their goals or methods differ. Therefore, it's CoCoGM.
