Okay, so I need to classify the citation in the given passage. Let's start by looking at the passage provided. The user mentioned that the citation is at the spot marked with @@CITATION@@. Let me focus on the context around that citation.

The passage says: “Recent studies on the pathogenicity of Puccinia psidii in Brazil showed high virulence in various acacia species @@CITATION@@. In contrast, a different strain in Florida showed lower virulence levels, suggesting regional adaptation.”

First, the key sentence is comparing two studies: one from recent research in Brazil which found high virulence in acacia species, and another from a study in Florida where a different strain showed lower virulence. The citation here is likely referencing the Brazilian study. 

Now, applying the step-by-step guide. Step 1 is extracting the context discussing the citation. The context is about comparing the findings of two regions. The citation's intent is part of a contrast between the Brazilian results and the Florida results. 

Step 2 involves identifying the general intent. The comparison here is between the results of the cited work (Brazil's high virulence) with another study's results (Florida's lower virulence). According to the definitions, CoCoRes is when the citation compares results. The example given under CoCoRes talks about differing results in experiments versus cited work. Here, the author is contrasting their findings with the cited study's results, indicating they used CoCoRes.

In Step 3, selecting the specific rhetorical class. Since it's a comparison of results between the cited paper and the citing paper, CoCoRes is the correct label. Even though the example mentions experiments conducted by others, in this case, the author is contrasting their findings (Florida) with the cited study's (Brazil), which falls under CoCoRes.
