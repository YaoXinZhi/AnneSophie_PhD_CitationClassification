Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user provided a citation passage in the context of a scientific article about plant health. My job is to determine the appropriate rhetorical class for the citation. 

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage says, "The detection of grapevine yellows phytoplasma has been reported using PCR techniques (Smith et al., 2020). @@CITATION@@ further demonstrated the presence of these phytoplasma in adjacent vineyards." 

Looking at the context before the citation: Smith et al. reported detection using PCR. Then, @@CITATION@@ is used to say "further demonstrated presence in adjacent vineyards." So, the citation here is adding more evidence or confirmation about the presence of phytoplasma in other areas.

Next step is identifying the general intent. The phrase "further demonstrated" suggests that the cited work supports the previous finding or adds to it. The intent here seems supportive because the authors are using the citation to back up their point about the spread or presence of phytoplasma beyond what Smith et al. found.

Then, applying the classification definitions. Support is used when the citation confirms the work of the citing authors. In the example given, "All subscales were consistent with previous research... participants did not distinguish..." So here, the citation supports the current findings by confirming them with prior research.

Comparing that example to the given passage, the cited work further demonstrates presence elsewhere, which supports the current study's claims, perhaps by showing consistency or additional evidence. 

So the general intent is Supportive. Then the specific rhetorical class would be Support, as it supports the work of the citing authors by confirming or adding to their findings.
