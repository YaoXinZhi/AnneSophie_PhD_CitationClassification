Okay, let's tackle this. The task is to classify the citation into one of the rhetorical classes. First, I need to look at the passage where the citation is mentioned. The user hasn't provided the actual text yet, but based on the example given in the instructions, I can infer the process.

The user mentioned a plant health domain scientific article. Suppose the passage around @@CITATION@@ is discussing a study's findings related to phytoplasma in plants. For instance, maybe the citation is used to compare conflicting results between two studies. For example, "Conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima @@CITATION@@".

Step 1: Extract context. The key part here is comparing conflicting results between two studies mentioned. 

Step 2: Determine intent. Comparing explanations or claims between cited studies rather than contrasting with the current paper's work. 

Step 3: Referring to CoCoXY as the example given in the user's instructions shows CoCoXY being used when two cited studies are compared against each other. Therefore, the correct classification would be CoCoXY.
