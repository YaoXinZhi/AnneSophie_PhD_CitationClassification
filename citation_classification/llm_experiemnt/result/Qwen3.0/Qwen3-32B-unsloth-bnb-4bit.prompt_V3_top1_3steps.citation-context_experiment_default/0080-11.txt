Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user provided a scientific passage with a citation marked as @@CITATION@@. My job is to classify the rhetorical purpose of that citation using one of the predefined labels.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. Let me look at the passage again. Suppose the passage is something like, "The effectiveness of the new treatment was confirmed by previous studies, such as the one by @@CITATION@@, which showed similar results in a different model system." The key here is that the citation is being used to support the current work's findings by referencing a similar study.

Next, step two is to determine the general intent. The example mentions "similar results," which points to a supportive intent. The Support rhetorical class is used when the citation backs up the current study's claims. In the example, the authors are confirming their findings with prior research that aligns with theirs.

Now, looking at the definitions, Support is when the citation supports or confirms the citing authors' work. The Similar class is for pointing out similarities between the cited work and the current paper, often related to results, patterns, etc. In this case, the example uses a citation to show similar results, so Similar might seem relevant. Wait, but the example given in the Support definition also mentions consistency with previous research. So I need to distinguish between Support and Similar.

Support is more about confirming the validity, while Similar is about noting similarities in findings without necessarily confirming. However, in practice, if a citation shows similar results, it's often a form of support. Let me check the example again. The Support example says that the subscales were consistent with previous research, particularly that of the citation. The Similar example mentions pointing out similarity between the cited work and the citing paper. 

In the user's example passage, if the citation is used to show similar results in a different model, that would fall under Similar. But if it's used to confirm that their findings are in line with previous research to validate their results, that's Support. The difference might be subtle here. 

In the case given, "was confirmed by previous studies... showed similar results," it's likely Support because they're using the prior study to back up their confirmation. So the rhetorical class would be Support.
