Okay, let's see. The user provided a citation passage where they want me to determine the rhetorical class. The passage is about plant health in the context of phytoplasma in daisy plants. Let me parse through the steps.

First, extract the context around the citation. The sentence says that two strains of phytoplasma were reported in young leaves and roots of daisy plants by Wei et al., 2004 and Saracco et al., 2006. Then it mentions conflicting results described for a related phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima via the given citation. 

Next, identify the general intent. The conflicting results indicate a comparison between studies, but not directly comparing with the current paper's work. The example provided for CoCoXY mentions comparing cited studies with each other. 

Comparing CoCoXY's example: the current example here is similar. The CoCoXY class is when two cited works are contrasted, not with the paper itself. Here, the authors are pointing out conflicting results between Wei et al. and the cited study, suggesting a disagreement between those cited works. Therefore, the rhetorical class here should be CoCoXY.
