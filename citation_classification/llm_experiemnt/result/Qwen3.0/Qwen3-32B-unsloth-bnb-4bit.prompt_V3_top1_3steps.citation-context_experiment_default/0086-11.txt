Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the rhetorical class for this citation. The passage given is about plant health, specifically dealing with insect hosts and bacterial communities.

First step is to extract the context around the citation. The sentence says, "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly... is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks... @@CITATION@@." 

The key part here is "is supported by," which indicates that the authors are using the cited work to back up their own findings. The example given in the definitions for 'Support' mentions that the citation is used to support or confirm the work of the citing authors. The example provided in the instructions is similar: "supported by recent cross-taxon investigations... @@CITATION@@" which aligns with the example given for the 'Support' class.

Now, checking if there's a more specific class. The options are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Motivation, Future, Support, Similar, Usage, Weakness, Neutral. The context here is about supporting their finding with another study's results. The 'Support' class is when the citation confirms the authors' work. The example given in the instructions for 'Support' is when subscales were consistent with previous research, which is exactly what's happening here. 

I need to make sure it's not 'Similar' instead. The 'Similar' class is for pointing out similarities between the cited work and the current paper. In this case, the authors are saying their finding is supported by another study, which is more about backing up their claim rather than pointing out a similarity. 

So the correct class here should be 'Support'.
