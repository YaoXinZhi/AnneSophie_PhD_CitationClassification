Okay, let's go through this step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The citation here is used in the sentence: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@." So the context is about the setup being described in a previous study. 

Next, figure out the intent. The authors are referencing a prior experimental setup. They're indicating that they didn't describe it themselves but are using a description that was already established in another paper. That points towards the use of a method or tool from the cited work.

Looking at the rhetorical classes, when a citation refers directly to methods or tools used in the current study, the class is usually 'Usage'. The example given under 'Usage' mentions an experimental setup being cited as previously described.

So comparing to the example, since they're directly using the setup from the cited paper, this fits the 'Usage' category. It's not about supporting results, comparing methods or results, nor is it foundational or neutral. Therefore, the correct label here is 'Usage'.

#Step 1 Extraction:
"The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@."

#Step 2 Identification:
This citation refers to a description of an experimental setup used in a prior study, indicating the current authors are relying on a previously established methodology.

#Step 3 Final Output:
```json
{"label": "Usage"}
