Okay, let me try to figure out the correct rhetorical class for this citation. 

First, I need to look at the context around the @@CITATION@@. The passage says: "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly is supported... In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages... whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@@." 

So the authors are saying their finding is supported by previous research mentioned in the citation. The key word here is "supported," which might indicate that the cited work is used to back up their current findings.

Looking at the definitions, "Support" is when the citation is used to support, confirm the work, result, or finding. The example given under Support mentions that subscales were consistent with previous research, so it's confirming similar results. 

The example under Similar mentions pointing out similarity between the cited work and the current paper. Here, the authors state their findings are supported by similar ones in fleas and ticks. So they are comparing their findings to the cited work's findings. However, since the example under Support also involves results being consistent with previous research, perhaps this is Support rather than Similar. Wait, but Similar mentions pointing out similarities in results, patterns, phenomena. In this case, the cited work's findings are similar to their own. However, the wording here uses "supported by," which leans towards Support. 

So maybe it's Similar because they're pointing out that their finding is similar to the cited one. Let me check the example for Similar again. The example says: "Our finding... is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations... In fleas and ticks... whereas rodent host... @@CITATION@@" — which is exactly the structure here. The example given in the prompt for Similar is actually identical to the current case. So comparing to their own example, this should be classified as Similar. 

Wait, the prompt's Similar example is: "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly [...] is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks [...] whereas rodent host [...] @@CITATION@@" — which is exactly the same as the given passage here. So the correct class is Similar. 

Therefore, the answer should be Similar.
