Okay, let's see what the task is here. I need to classify the citation in the given passage into one of the specified rhetorical classes. First, I should extract the context around the citation. The passage is: "The occurrence of the phytoplasma was detected by direct PCR amplification of 16S rRNA gene fragments and confirmed by DNA sequencing @@CITATION@@." 

So the context here is that they detected phytoplasma using PCR amplification of 16S rRNA and confirmed it with DNA sequencing, citing some work. The citation here is supporting the confirmation method. They're using the cited work's method to validate their own results.

Looking at the intent, they're confirming their findings by referring to the sequencing technique described in the cited paper. The citation is being used to support their own confirmation process. The options are Support, Similar, Usage, etc. 

If they're using the method from the citation as a support for their own confirmation, then it's likely the Support class. Because the cited work is supporting their finding through the mentioned techniques. Alternatively, if they are directly using the method (like a tool), maybe Usage? But the example for Usage is a setup being described previously. Here it's confirmation via sequencing as per the cited work's methods. 

Wait, the example for Support says they confirm their own results with the cited work. Like "confirmed by DNA sequencing @@CITATION@@", which would be supporting their confirmation. So Support would be appropriate here. The cited work is supporting their claim of confirmation through sequencing. Alternatively, CoCoXY might be comparing explanations? But there's no comparison in the sentence. It's a direct confirmation using a cited method. 

So the most likely label is Support or Usage. Usage is when the method is directly used. The example for Usage is something like "experimental set-up was described previously". Here they might be using the sequencing method described in @@CITATION@ to confirm their PCR results. So maybe Usage? But Support is when they use the cited results to support their own findings. Wait, the example for Support is: "All subscales were consistent with previous research... also using a U.S. sample..." which is similar to confirming with prior findings. In this case, maybe Support fits because they're confirming using the cited work's sequencing method. Hmm.

Wait, no. Support is more about confirming their own results are aligned with the cited work, whereas Usage is the application of a method from the cited work. For instance, using a tool or method described in the cited paper. Here, they are confirming their results by the sequencing method from the cited work. So the citation is referring to a method they used. Therefore, it's Usage. But the example for Usage mentions the experimental setup was described in detail previously, so that's a direct usage. In this case, maybe the DNA sequencing method cited is something they used as per the @@CITATION@ paper. Therefore, Usage would be appropriate here. 

Wait, but another angle: if they are confirming their PCR results by DNA sequencing as done in the cited paper, maybe they're following the cited method. So it's a Usage of the method from @@CITATION@. Therefore, the rhetorical class is Usage. Alternatively, Support if the cited work's results support their conclusion. 

Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous. Let's look at definitions again. Usage is when the cited work's methods, tools etc are used. Support is when the cited work supports the current claim. Here, the authors are confirming their PCR detection via sequencing as confirmed by the cited work's method. So it's more about applying the method (Usage) rather than supporting a finding with a similar result as in Support example. For example, if the cited paper had previously found phytoplasma using sequencing, and this paper is confirming their detection via sequencing, then Support would be appropriate because their finding aligns with previous work. But if they are using the cited paper's sequencing method as the protocol, then it's Usage. 

In the given sentence, the detection was confirmed by DNA sequencing as in the cited work. So maybe they are referring to the method of sequencing as described in the cited paper. So that would be Usage, because they're using the method. So the label should be Usage. Wait, the example given for Usage is "the experimental set-up was described previously". Here, the authors are using a method (DNA sequencing) from cited work to confirm their PCR results. So the citation is cited because their confirmation was done via that sequencing method as in the reference. Therefore, Usage fits here. 

Yes, I think that's the case. So the answer is Usage.
