Okay, let's see. The user provided a citation passage and wants me to classify it into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage is talking about studies that reported high concentrations of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains in leaves and roots of infected daisies, citing Wei et al., 2004 and Saracco et al., 2006. Then it mentions conflicting results for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima, tagged with @@CITATION@@. 

So, the next step is to figure out the intent. The sentence is comparing the reported findings with conflicting ones in another study. The rhetorical classes related to comparison between studies are CoCoRes and CoCoXY. CoCoRes is for comparing results directly with the citing paper, while CoCoXY is for comparing explanations or claims between cited studies themselves, not with the citing paper.

In this case, the cited study (marked by @@CITATION@@) is being contrasted with the previous studies. The author is pointing out conflicting results in the cited study compared to others. Since the comparison is between two cited studies (the ones mentioned before and the one cited with @@CITATION@@), not between the citing paper and a single study, this fits CoCoXY. 

So the correct class here should be CoCoXY because it's comparing the explanations or claims of two different cited works.
