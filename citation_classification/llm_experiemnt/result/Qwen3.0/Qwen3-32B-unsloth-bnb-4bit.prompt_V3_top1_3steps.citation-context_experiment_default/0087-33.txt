Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage is:

"The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments... @@CITATION@@."

So, the key part here is talking about comparing the results of their work with those from the cited study. They mention "substantially differ," which directly points to a comparison of results. 

Next, determining the general intent. Since they are contrasting their findings with the cited work's results, the intent is comparative regarding outcomes or findings. According to the task guidelines, this falls under Supportive intent, specifically the CoCoRes class because it's about comparing results.

Finally, checking the examples for CoCoRes. The example given says, "The results obtained... substantially differ from... @@CITATION@@," which is exactly what the provided passage is doing. So CoCoRes fits here.
