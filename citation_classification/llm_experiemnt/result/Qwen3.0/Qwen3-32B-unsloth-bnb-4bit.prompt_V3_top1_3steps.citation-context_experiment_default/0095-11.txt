Okay, let me tackle this classification step by step. First, I need to look at the citation passage provided by the user.

The passage is: "The identification of genes involved in resistance responses to Phytophthora palmivora was reported in @@CITATION@@."

So, step one is to extract the context around the citation. The sentence is stating that the cited work reported the identification of genes involved in resistance to Phytophthora palmivora. The key here is that the authors are pointing out that the cited study found specific genes related to resistance against this pathogen. 

Next, step two is identifying the general intent. The context here seems to be acknowledging that a previous study has found these resistance genes. The citing authors aren't contrasting their results with the cited work, nor are they criticizing or supporting their findings directly. They're just stating that the identification was done. There's no indication of comparison, motivation, future work, usage of a method, or critique. It's a straightforward mention of a finding without any evaluative language. 

Now, moving to step three, selecting the specific rhetorical class. Looking at the definitions, Neutral fits when the citation is used descriptively without supporting, comparing, or criticizing. The example given under Neutral is just stating a fact about the cited work's findings without adding an argument. The example here is similar: the authors are neutrally reporting that the cited work identified certain genes. There's no direct support, comparison, or critique. The intent isn't to build upon it (which would be Basis or Support) or to compare results (CoCoRes). So Neutral seems correct here.
