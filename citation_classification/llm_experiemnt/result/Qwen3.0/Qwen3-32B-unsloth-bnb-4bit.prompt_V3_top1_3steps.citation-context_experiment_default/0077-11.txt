Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in this passage. The passage is: "The use of molecular markers has become standard practice in plant pathology for the identification of species and pathogen differentiation @@CITATION@@." 

First, Step 1 is to extract the context around the citation. The sentence says that using molecular markers is standard in plant pathology for identifying species and differentiating pathogens, citing a source. The context here is explaining a current standard practice, referencing the citation as part of establishing that this practice is standard.

Step 2 is identifying the general intent. The citation is used to support the claim that molecular markers are standard practice. It's not comparing methods, results, or goals, nor is it criticizing or motivating future work. It seems like it's providing a foundation or basis for the current statement, confirming that this practice is established based on prior work.

Looking at the definitions, Basis is when the citation references the intellectual foundation. Here, the citation is supporting the assertion about standard practice, so it's a foundation for the current claim. Basis would fit here. 

Alternatively, Support could be considered if they're using the citation to back up their own findings. But in the example for Support, the citation is used to confirm their results. Here, the authors are stating a general fact (standard practice) that's supported by the citation. So Basis might be more accurate.

Neutral could be if they're just stating a fact without argument, but the example of Neutral mentions a descriptive use. However, in Basis examples, the citation introduces foundational work. Since molecular markers being standard practice is a foundational or established method in the field, citing the source that established or validated that practice would be Basis.

So final decision is Basis.
