Okay, I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the given citation in the passage. Let's start by looking at the example passage.

The passage says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@."

First, I extract the context around the citation. The author is talking about their results differing from those of another study that used specific metal targets. 

Next, identifying the intent. When a paper mentions that their results differ from a previous study's results, this is typically a comparison of results. Looking at the provided classes, CoCoRes is the category for comparing results. 

Checking the example for CoCoRes confirms that: the example states comparing present work's results with cited experiments. The current passage matches this structure, so the correct label should be CoCoRes.
