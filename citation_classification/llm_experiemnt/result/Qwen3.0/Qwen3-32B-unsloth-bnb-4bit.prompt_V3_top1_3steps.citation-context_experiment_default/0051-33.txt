Okay, let's see. The task is to assign the correct rhetorical class to the citation in the given passage. The passage is:

"Our results are consistent with previous findings that observed a similar effect in the response of another plant pathosystem to the same treatment. For example, @@CITATION@@ reported that the application of biochar... @@CITATION@@ further demonstrated...".

First, I need to extract the context around the first @@CITATION@@. The second citation here continues the discussion about the same treatment's effect, but the first citation introduces a previous finding. The phrase "consistent with previous findings" indicates that the cited work supports the current results.

Next, identify the intent. Using "consistent" and introducing another study's findings suggests that the citation is supporting their own results. Looking at the example in the Support class, where they mention being consistent with previous research, that's a clear sign of Support. The authors are using the citation to back up their claim that others have seen the same effect.

Comparing other classes: It's not CoCoRes because they're not contrasting results, but aligning. Not Motivation, as it's not about justifying why they did the research. It's straightforward support. So the correct label should be Support.
