Okay, let's try to figure out the rhetorical class for this citation. The passage given is about the impact of insect herbivory on phytoplasma multiplication in plants. The citation is placed in a sentence that says, "These findings suggest that insect herbivory may influence phytoplasma multiplication in plants and that such effects differ among phytoplasma strains, as previously proposed by @@CITATION@." 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The authors are discussing their findings and mention that their results support a previous proposal by the cited work. The key part here is "previously proposed by @@CITATION@." So, the citation is being used to show that a prior study had already suggested what their current findings are now supporting.

Next step is to identify the general intent. The citation here isn't introducing foundational knowledge, nor is it a comparison between methods or results. The authors are stating that their current findings align with what was previously proposed by the cited work. This sounds like they're supporting their own findings by referencing the cited work's prior proposal. So the intent is supportive of their own work through a previous citation.

Looking at the classes, Support is when the citation is used to back up the citing authors' work. The example given for Support mentions consistency with previous research. In this case, the authors are aligning their findings with a previous proposal, which fits the Support category because they are confirming their own results with the prior study's proposal.

I also need to check if it's Similar. Similar is when there's a similarity between cited work and their own findings. However, in this case, they're referencing a previous proposal that their findings support, not just pointing out similarity. The example for Similar talks about findings supporting cross-taxon investigations, which is a bit different. The key here is the use of "previously proposed," which points to Support rather than Similar. The cited work isn't a similarity example but a prior support point.

Therefore, the correct rhetorical class here is Support.
