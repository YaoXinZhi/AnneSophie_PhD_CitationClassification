Okay, let's tackle this citation classification step by step. The task is to look at the context provided and assign the most appropriate rhetorical class to the citation mentioned. Let's first look closely at the passage given.

Looking at the context around the @@CITATION@@, it says, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." 

So the key part here is the phrase "substantially differ from the results of the experiments." This immediately suggests that the authors are comparing their results to those previously obtained by the cited work. The word "results" is crucial here because it points towards a comparison of outcomes or findings between two studies.

In the list of rhetorical classes provided, CoCoRes is defined as the citation being used to compare or contrast results or findings of the cited work with those of the citing paper. The example given for CoCoRes also talks about differing results from experiments, which aligns with this passage. 

The task now is to match the intent. Since the context talks about differences in results between the current study and a previous one, it's a direct comparison of findings. There doesn't seem to be foundational information, motivation, support, similarity, or a critical analysis happening here. 

So considering all the options, CoCoRes is the most accurate classification here because it's specifically about differing results compared to prior work.
