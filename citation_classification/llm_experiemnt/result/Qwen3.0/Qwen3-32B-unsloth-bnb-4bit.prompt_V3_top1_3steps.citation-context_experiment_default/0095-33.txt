Okay, let's start by looking at the given passage. The sentence with the citation is: "The role of plant pathogens in the suppression of arthropod herbivore populations has been recognized for decades @@CITATION@@."

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The sentence directly uses the citation to state that the recognition of plant pathogens suppressing arthropod herbivores has been around for decades. There's no comparison or contrast with other works here. The author is referencing the fact that others have acknowledged this role before, which supports the current discussion. 

Next, I'll determine the general intent. The citation is used to support the statement that this role is not new but has been recognized for a long time. This seems like a supportive reference, confirming that existing literature backs up the claim. The example under "Support" says that citations are used to support or confirm findings, which fits here. There's no indication of comparison with another study's results or goals, nor is there criticism or a call to future research. The citation serves to affirm that prior research supports the current claim. 

So the rhetorical class here should be "Support" because it's confirming the authors' assertion by referring to previous studies that have established this role.
