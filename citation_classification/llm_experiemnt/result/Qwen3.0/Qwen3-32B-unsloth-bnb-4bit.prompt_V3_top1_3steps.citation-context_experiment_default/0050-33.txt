Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. The user provided a citation passage that mentions @@CITATION@@ and asks me to determine the appropriate rhetorical class.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage says, “These findings suggest a novel mechanism... while previous studies have shown that... similar results were obtained by @@CITATION@@.”

Looking at the surrounding text, the authors are discussing their findings and referring to a previous study. The key phrase is “similar results were obtained by,” which indicates that they're pointing out a similarity between their results and those cited. 

Next, identifying the general intent. The mention of similarity points to a supportive or comparative intent. The example under 'Similar' mentions a similarity in findings or patterns. Here, the authors are highlighting that their observations align with another study's results. 

Comparing to the classes, 'Similar' fits because they're noting resemblance between their work and the cited study. The example given for 'Similar' also involves findings being supported by previous work, which matches this context. 

Other options like Support might be a distraction if the citation was confirming their claim, but in this case, it's about similarity rather than direct support. CoCoRes involves comparing results with their own, but here it's similarity without contrasting differences. Hence, the best fit is 'Similar'.
