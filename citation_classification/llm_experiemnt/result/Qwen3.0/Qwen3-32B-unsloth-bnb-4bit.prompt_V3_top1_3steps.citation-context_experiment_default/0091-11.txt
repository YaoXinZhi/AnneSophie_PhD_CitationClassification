Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step.

First, I need to look at the provided passage. The user mentioned a scientific article citation related to plant health. The citation passage is enclosed in backticks. Let me focus on the relevant part where the @@CITATION@@ appears.

The example given uses a Neutral classification. But I need to apply this to the actual user's content. Wait, the user included an example with "Neutral" where they cited that magnetic water treatment devices spread since 1975. The citation there is just stating a fact without any comparison, support, criticism, etc.

Now, applying this to the user's specific case: they need me to classify the citation based on the context around it. Let me check the passage again. Wait, the actual passage isn't provided here. The user might have included their example as part of the context. Hmm, perhaps the example is the content they are referring to. Wait, the user's input starts with the task setup.

Wait, the user's prompt is part of the context given in the initial message. They included an example where Neutral was used. Let me recheck the instructions. The user wants me to process a scientific article passage where the @@CITATION@@ is tagged. But in the current scenario, the actual passage isn't provided here. Wait, maybe the user is referring to their own example as the test case? Wait, maybe I need to re-express the Neutral classification for the given example. 

Wait, perhaps the user wants me to take the example they provided for Neutral as the reference passage. Let me parse it again. The example passage is: "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@." This is Neutral because it's a descriptive statement without argumentation. 

So, applying the steps to that passage: Step 1 is extracting the context around the citation, which is the entire sentence. Step 2 would be determining the intent as Descriptive (Neutral), as it's just stating a historical fact. Step 3 is selecting Neutral from the predefined options.

Since the example provided is the one being processed, the correct classification here is Neutral. Therefore, the output should be "Neutral".
