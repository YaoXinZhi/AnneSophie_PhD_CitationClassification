Okay, let me work through this step by step. The user provided a citation in the context of a scientific article passage, and I need to classify its rhetorical role. 

First, the task is to extract the context around the citation. The citation is in the plant health domain, and here's the passage: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." 

So Step 1 is to extract the relevant semantic context. The key part here is the phrase "substantially differ from the results" followed by referencing the experiments mentioned in the citation. The intent is clearly comparing results between their study and the cited work.

Moving to Step 2, the general intent here is a Comparative one, specifically about comparing results. According to the definitions provided, that falls under CoCoRes, which is when the citation is used to directly compare results or findings of the cited work with those of the citing paper. 

Step 3 is selecting the specific rhetorical class. The example given for CoCoRes mentions differing results, which matches the context here. The authors are pointing out how their results differ from those cited, which aligns with CoCoRes. 

I should double-check the other options. It's not Basis because they aren't establishing a foundation. Not Motivation or Future either. It's not a similarity but a difference, so not Similar. No mention of methods or goals being compared (CoCoGM), just results. No support, usage, criticism, or neutrality. So CoCoRes is definitely the correct label here.
