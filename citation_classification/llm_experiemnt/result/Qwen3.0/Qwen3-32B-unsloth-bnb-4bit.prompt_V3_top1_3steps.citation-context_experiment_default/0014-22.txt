Okay, let's start by looking at the citation passage provided. The user wants me to determine the rhetorical class of the citation marked as @@CITATION@@.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@."

Now, the next step is to identify the general intent. The key part here is "substantially differ from the results of the experiments..." This is directly comparing their results with those cited. According to the definitions, when results are compared or contrasted with another study's results, it falls under CoCoRes (Comparison of Results). 

Looking at the example for CoCoRes: the example contrasts their results with cited experiments. This matches the structure and intent of the given passage. There's no mention of methods, goals, explanations, etc., just a direct comparison of results. 

Therefore, the most appropriate label here is CoCoRes.
