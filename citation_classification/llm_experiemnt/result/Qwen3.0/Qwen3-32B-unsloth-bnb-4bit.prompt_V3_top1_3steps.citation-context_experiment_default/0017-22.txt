Okay, let's take a look at this citation example. The sentence is "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." 

First step is to extract the context around the citation. The key part here is comparing the present results with those from previous experiments using specific metal targets mentioned. 

Next, identify the general intent. The author is directly contrasting their current findings with those of the cited work's results. According to the definitions, when results are compared directly, that falls under Comparative â†’ CoCoRes.

Finally, checking against the examples given for CoCoRes matches this situation where results are being contrasted. So the correct class should be CoCoRes.
