Okay, let me tackle this step by step. First, I need to look at the given passage and find where the citation is placed. The passage says: "Similar patterns of increased viral RNA in the haemolymph after injection were observed by @@CITATION@@ with another persistent virus, Cricket paralysis virus, in its insect host, Acheta domesticus."

Step 1 is extracting the context around the citation. The sentence before the citation mentions that similar patterns were observed by the cited work. The key words here are "similar patterns," which indicate a comparison between the current study's findings and the cited study's results.

Step 2 involves identifying the general intent. The phrase "similar patterns" suggests that the citation is being used to highlight a similarity between the findings of the current paper and the referenced study. According to the definitions provided, a similarity in results would fall under the "Supportive" category since it's about pointing out similar findings.

Step 3 is selecting the specific rhetorical class. The example given for "Similar" mentions pointing out similarities between the cited work and the citing paper regarding results, which matches the context here. The citation is used to show that another study observed a similar pattern, thus pointing out a similarity. Therefore, the correct label should be "Similar."
