Okay, let's tackle this classification task step by step.

First, I need to understand the context around the citation. The passage mentions comparing the results of the current study with those from a previous experiment involving deuterium-saturated metal targets. The key phrase here is "substantially differ from the results... @@CITATION@@", which indicates a direct comparison of findings between the two studies.

Next, determining the general intent. Since the author is contrasting their results with prior work, this falls under comparative rhetoric. The example given for CoCoRes involves comparing results or findings directly, which aligns with this scenario.

Now, selecting the specific rhetorical class. The example for CoCoRes states that when results are directly compared, it's CoCoRes. The passage here does exactly that, pointing out differences between their results and those cited. Therefore, the correct label is CoCoRes.
