Okay, let me tackle this classification step by step.

First, I need to extract the context of the citation mentioned. The passage says, "The results presented here confirm that resistance development in Bemisia argentifolii by overexpression of a specific CYP gene is significant. This gene's role was previously identified by @@CITATION@@."

So the citation is referencing a prior study that identified the role of a specific CYP gene. The current work is confirming those findings by showing resistance development through overexpression. The context mentions that the cited work's findings were previously established.

Next, identifying the general intent. The current research is confirming the earlier results. When a citation is used to support the current work's findings by referencing prior results that align, it's usually a Support rhetorical class. The example given in the Support definition includes phrases like "consistent with previous research... also using..." which is similar hereâ€”they're confirming the subscales were consistent.

Since the citation here is used to support the current work's conclusions by referencing prior findings, the correct label should be Support.
