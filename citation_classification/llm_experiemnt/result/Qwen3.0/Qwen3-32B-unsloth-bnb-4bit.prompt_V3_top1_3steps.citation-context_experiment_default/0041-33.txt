Okay, let's tackle this. First, I need to look at the passage provided and find where the citation is mentioned. The user's example shows that the citation is marked with @@CITATION@@, so I'll focus on that part.

The passage given is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@."

So the citation here is directly comparing the results of the current work with those from the cited study. The key phrase is "substantially differ from the results of..." which indicates a comparison of results. Looking at the definitions provided earlier, CoCoRes is when the citation is used to compare or contrast the results or findings of the cited work with the citing paper. The example given under CoCoRes also involves contrasting results between two studies. This matches the current case. The other options like CoCoGM would involve goals or methods, which isn't the case here. It's definitely about the results. So the correct label should be CoCoRes.
