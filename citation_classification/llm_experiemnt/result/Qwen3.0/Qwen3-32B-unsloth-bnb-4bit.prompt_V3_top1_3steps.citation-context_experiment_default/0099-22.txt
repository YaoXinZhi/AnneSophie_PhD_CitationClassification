Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. The task is to assign the appropriate rhetorical class to the given citation in the scientific passage. 

First, I need to look at the context around the citation. The sentence provided is: "The experimental protocol followed the procedures detailed in @@CITATION@@." 

Step 1: Extracting the context. The key part here is "followed the procedures detailed in @@CITATION@@", which indicates that the cited work's methods are being referenced.

Step 2: Identifying the general intent. The phrase "followed the procedures" suggests that the cited work is being used as a reference for the methods employed in the current study. This points towards a foundational or supportive role since they are using the procedures outlined in the cited paper.

Step 3: Selecting the specific rhetorical class. Looking at the definitions, "Usage" refers to when a method, tool, or dataset from the cited work is directly used. The example given is about an experimental setup described in a previous paper. The current sentence mentions following procedures from the cited work, which aligns with "Usage" as it's a direct reference to methods used.

Therefore, the most appropriate class here is "Usage".
