Okay, let's tackle this classification problem step by step.

First, I need to understand the context around the citation in the given passage. The passage is:

```
The detection efficacy was validated by comparing our results with those reported by @@CITATION@@.
```

So the key part here is that they're validating their detection efficacy by comparing their results with another study's ("those reported by @@CITATION@@"). 

Next, looking at the general intent. Comparing results falls under the "Comparative" category since they're contrasting their findings with someone else's. But wait, there are multiple classes under Comparative: CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY. Let's see which one fits best.

Looking at the examples:
- CoCoRes is about comparing results directly.
- The example given is comparing experimental results.
- In the current case, they're directly comparing their results with the cited work's results ("our results with those reported by @@CITATION@@").
- The example provided for Support says the citation confirms the authors' work, but here it's a comparison of results between the papers, not support.

Therefore, this fits CoCoRes best because it's about the results comparison. They aren't comparing methods or goals, just the outcomes.
