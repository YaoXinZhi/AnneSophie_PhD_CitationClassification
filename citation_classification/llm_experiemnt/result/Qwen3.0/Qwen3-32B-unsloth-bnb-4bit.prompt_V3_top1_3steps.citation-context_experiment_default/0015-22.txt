Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. The citation is in the context of the passage provided. 

First, I need to extract the relevant context around the citation. The passage mentions, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@."

Looking at the context, the key phrase here is "substantially differ from the results of the experiments," followed by the citation. This indicates that the current work's results are being contrasted directly with those from the cited paper.

Next, identifying the general intent. The citation is used to compare the findings between the current study and the previous one. This falls under the comparative category. Now, the specific classes under comparative are CoCoGM, CoCoRes, or CoCoXY. 

CoCoRes is for comparing results, which matches here since the results are the focus. The example given in CoCoRes mentions differing results from cited experiments, which aligns with the example provided. The current passage is directly contrasting their results with the cited work's results.

Therefore, the correct rhetorical class here is CoCoRes.
