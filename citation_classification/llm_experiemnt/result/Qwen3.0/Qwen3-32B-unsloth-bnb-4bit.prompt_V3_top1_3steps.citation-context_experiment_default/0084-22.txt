Okay, let me tackle this classification step by step. First, I need to look at the citation within the provided passage. The passage mentions that the authors used a specific method for pathogen detection, and they reference a previous study by @@CITATION@@ which introduced a different detection technique. 

The context is comparing two methods: the one used in the current study and another described in the cited work. The key here is that they're contrasting their approach's method with the cited method's approach. The sentence structure suggests that the cited work's method is different in its approach, using a different principle. 

Moving to Step 2, the intent here isn't to support their own method but to show how their approach contrasts with another's in terms of methods. The comparative aspect points towards a CoCoGM classification because they are comparing their goals or methods against the cited work's. 

In CoCoGM examples, the comparison is about either goals or methods. Here, the authors are contrasting their method with the cited method's approach, making CoCoGM the appropriate label.
