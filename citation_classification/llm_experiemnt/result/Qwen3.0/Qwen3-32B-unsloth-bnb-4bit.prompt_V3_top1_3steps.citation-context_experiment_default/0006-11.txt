Okay, let's tackle this classification task. The user provided a passage where they need to determine the rhetorical class of a citation. The citation in question is tagged as @@CITATION@@. 

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The relevant sentence is: "To demonstrate the pathogenicity of the isolate, it was inoculated onto healthy sweet oranges, and symptoms were similar to those observed in the field @@CITATION@@." The key part here is "symptoms were similar to those observed in the field @@CITATION@@".

Next, identifying the general intent. The authors are stating that the symptoms observed after inoculation are similar to field-observed symptoms, and they reference the citation here. The purpose is to confirm or support their finding by pointing to a similarity with another study's results. 

Comparing this to the predefined classes, the 'Similar' class applies when the citation is used to highlight a similarity between the cited work and the current paper. The example given for 'Similar' involves findings in the cited work supporting similarities with the current study's results. In this case, the authors are aligning their results with those in the cited work, indicating a similarity in observed symptoms. 

Therefore, the most appropriate label here is 'Similar'.
