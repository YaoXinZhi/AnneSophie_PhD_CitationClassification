Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step.

First, the user provided a passage with a citation marked as @@CITATION@@. The task is to determine which rhetorical class this citation belongs to based on the surrounding context.

The passage says: "The present results suggest that the disease development could be efficiently controlled by the combined application of the two biological control agents. The synergistic effect revealed here is not unprecedented, as similar interactions enhancing disease suppression were recently described in other pathosystems @@CITATION@@."

Starting with Step 1, I need to extract the relevant context around the citation. The critical part before the citation mentions that the authors observed a synergistic effect and state that similar interactions have been described elsewhere. The citation is used to reference where these similar interactions were reported.

Moving to Step 2, identifying the general intent. Here, the authors are pointing out that their findings align with previous studies. They mention "similar interactions," indicating that the cited work has akin results or observations. This falls under a supportive intent, as they're backing up their current findings with existing literature. However, since they specify similarity in results, it might lean towards the 'Similar' class instead of a broad Support.

In Step 3, according to the definitions, 'Similar' is when the citation highlights a similarity between the cited work and the citing paper, concerning results or phenomena. The example given involves a finding supported by a recent study pointing out similarities. This matches the current context where the authors note that others observed similar interactions, hence pointing out similarity in phenomena or results.

Therefore, the most appropriate label here is 'Similar'.
