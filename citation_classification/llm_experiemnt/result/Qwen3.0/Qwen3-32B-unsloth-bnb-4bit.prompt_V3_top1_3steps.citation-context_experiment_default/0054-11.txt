Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in the given passage. Let's start by looking at the example passage again.

The passage is: "The use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@." 

So, the citation is mentioned in the context of the use of these devices spreading since a certain year. The example provided under the Neutral class had a similar structure, where the citation was used descriptively without any supporting, comparing, or critiquing intent. The example given was: "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@." And it was labeled as Neutral.

In the task instructions, Neutral is for citations used neutrally, descriptively without supporting, comparing, or motivating. Here, the sentence is just stating a fact about the spread of a technology, attributing it to the citation. There's no indication that the authors are supporting their argument with it, comparing their results, or pointing out a weakness. It's straightforward information reporting.

So, based on the example and the definition, this seems to be Neutral. The other classes don't fit here. Motivation would require explaining why their research is needed, which isn't the case. Support would mean the citation backs up their claims, but here it's just a factual statement. CoCo classes involve comparisons, which there's none here. Basis refers to foundational work, which isn't indicated either. Usage is when they use a method from the citation, which isn't happening here. Weakness would involve criticism, which is absent.

Therefore, the correct rhetorical class here is Neutral.
