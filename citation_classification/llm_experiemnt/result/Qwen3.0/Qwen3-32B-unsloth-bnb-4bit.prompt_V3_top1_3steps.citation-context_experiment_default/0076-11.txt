Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The sentence given is: "To evaluate leaf spot development, foliar symptoms were assessed 7 days postinoculation on a 0 to 5 scale, where 0 = no symptoms and 5 = 100% leaf blight according to the method described by @@CITATION@." 

So, the citation here is referring to the method used for assessing symptoms. The key part is "according to the method described by @@CITATION@." The intent here is to indicate that the current study is using a method that was previously described in the cited work. 

Next, looking at the general intent. Since the citation is about a method that's being directly used in the current research, this falls under the Technical category. The predefined classes for Technical are under Usage. The example given for Usage mentions a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup from the cited work being directly used. The example provided is: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@." 

Comparing that to the given sentence, the method of assessment is directly referenced, which the current study is following. Therefore, the rhetorical class here should be Usage.
