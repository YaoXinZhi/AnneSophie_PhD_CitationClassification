Okay, let's tackle this classification problem. First, I need to look at the example passage provided. The user didn't paste an actual passage here, but maybe in their test scenario there's a specific text to analyze. Since the example isn't given, maybe I should assume hypothetical steps based on the task description. Wait, perhaps the user expects me to consider a generic approach based on the provided definitions.

The task is to assign a rhetorical class to a citation mentioned as @@CITATION@@ in a scientific plant health article passage. The classes include Basis, CoCoGM, etc. Let me remember the definitions again. 

Step 1 is extracting context around @@CITATION@@. Need to focus only on the relevant parts. Step 2 is determining the intent—like foundational, comparative, motivational, etc.—then mapping it to the specific class in step 3.

Let me review the examples again. For Basis, the citation is about foundational work. CoCoGM is comparing goals or methods. Support is confirming the authors' findings with past studies. Motivation involves explaining why the research is done. Future suggests directions for future work. Weakness critiques the cited work. Neutral is descriptive without judgment or comparison.

If the citation is introducing a method used in their study, like mentioning a technique from another paper that they're applying, then that's 'Usage'. If they say their study's results differ from prior ones, that's CoCoRes. If they point out similarities, 'Similar'. If they criticize the cited work's limitations, 'Weakness'. 

So when analyzing a real passage, I should extract the surrounding sentences of the citation. Then figure out the intent: are they supporting their argument with it? Comparing methods? Motivating their study? Using their method?

Suppose the example passage was: "Our results confirm those of @@CITATION@@, which found similar effects of pesticide resistance in crop plants." Here, it's supporting their findings with prior research, so 'Support'. 

Another example: "While prior studies have focused on soil health @@CITATION@@, our work examines foliar diseases, highlighting a different approach." This would be CoCoGM as comparing methods/goals.

But without a specific example, I need to think through hypothetical steps. Let's say in the given task, the passage mentions the citation's work as a basis for their own findings, introducing foundational ideas. That's 'Basis'. Or if they cite a method directly used, 'Usage'. 

Since the task requires returning only the correct label based on the input passage, the critical part is accurately interpreting the citation's intent within that passage. Making sure not to mix up the classes, like mistaking a comparison of results (CoCoRes) with direct result contradiction (Weakness).

I need to be precise in each step: extract context, determine intent category, then pick the correct subclass. Let's proceed with the final JSON output as requested, given whatever hypothetical scenario the user presents.
