Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation mentioned in the given passage. First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage says: "Recent studies have identified the role of soil microbes in promoting plant growth under stress conditions. However, the mechanisms underlying these interactions remain unclear. A detailed investigation into microbial communities is needed to elucidate these processes, as highlighted by @@CITATION@". 

So, the citation is in the part that mentions the mechanism being unclear and suggests the need for a detailed investigation. The phrase "as highlighted by" usually points to a reference that underscores a knowledge gap or a need for further research. 

Looking at the general intent, the authors are pointing out a gap in current understanding and justifying why their research is necessary. That aligns with the Motivation category, which involves citing works that identify a problem or need for the current study. 

Now, checking the specific rhetorical classes under Motivation. The example given for Motivation includes citing previous work to show a need for further research. Here, the citation is highlighting the unclear mechanisms as a motivation for the present work. There's no mention of future directions beyond the current research's purpose, so it's more about justifying the current study rather than Future research. 

Therefore, the correct class should be Motivation.
