Okay, let's start by looking at the provided citation passage. The user wants me to classify the rhetorical role of a specific citation marked as @@CITATION@@ within a given text.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The example passage is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." 

The key part here is the phrase "substantially differ from the results... @@CITATION@\@". The authors are directly comparing their findings with those from previous experiments cited. Since they're contrasting their results with the cited work's results, according to the definitions given, this falls under CoCoRes (Comparison of Results). The example given for CoCoRes is almost identical to this case, where differences in results are highlighted by referencing a citation. The intent is to compare findings, not just mention them or criticize them. So the correct classification here is CoCoRes.
