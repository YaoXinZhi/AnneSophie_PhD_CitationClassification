Okay, let me go through this step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The user provided a passage where the citation is mentioned in the context of discussing the distribution of the pathogen "Candidatus Phytoplasma asteris" in different plant parts. The passage mentions conflicting results from another study (Cheluchi et al., 2014) regarding a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima.

Next, I need to determine the general intent. The citation here is comparing two different studies' findings about the same pathogen in different plant species. The first study reports high concentration in certain parts, while the cited study presents conflicting results. The example given for CoCoXY mentions comparing two cited studies with each other, not directly with the current paper. 

So the intent here is to compare or contrast the results or claims of the cited study with another study mentioned (Cheluchi et al., 2014). Since the example under CoCoXY involves conflicting results between two cited studies, this fits the CoCoXY category. The current citation is used to highlight conflicting findings between two different studies on different plants, not comparing with the current work's results. Therefore, the correct rhetorical class should be CoCoXY.
