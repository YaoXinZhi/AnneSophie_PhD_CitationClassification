Okay, let's start by looking at the context around the citation. The sentence says, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets... @@CITATION@@." The key part here is "substantially differ," which indicates a comparison between the current study's results and those from the cited work.

So, the general intent here is to compare results. According to the step-by-step breakdown, that falls under Supportive intent. But within the supportive category, there's a specific class called CoCoRes, which is used when comparing results of the cited work with the citing paper. 

The example given in CoCoRes is similar to this case: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from..." which matches our context. There's no mention of goals or methods differing, just the results themselves. Also, it's not contrasting two cited studies with each other, which would be CoCoXY. 

Therefore, the correct rhetorical class here should be CoCoRes because the citation is used to highlight differences in results between the current study and the cited work.
