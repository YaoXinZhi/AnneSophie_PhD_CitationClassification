Okay, let me tackle this step by step. First, I need to look at the citation passage provided. The user mentioned it's in a plant health domain scientific article, so the context is about plant health. The task is to classify the citation's rhetorical class.

The citation in question is tagged as @@CITATION@@ within the passage. Let me focus on the sentence around that tag. The example given by the user is from a passage that says: “The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@.” 

Step 1 is to extract the context. The key part here is talking about results differing from previous experiments. The phrase "substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted..." directly points to comparing results. 

Step 2 involves identifying the general intent. Comparing results would fall under the Comparative category. According to the definitions, if it's a comparison of results, the rhetorical class is CoCoRes. The example provided in the user prompt for CoCoRes is similar to this case where the authors are contrasting their findings with existing ones cited.

Step 3 is to select the specific class. Since the citation is used to compare the current results with those from deuterium experiments, the correct label here is CoCoRes. The passage doesn't show support, motivation, or future work. It's straightforwardly contrasting results. So the answer should be CoCoRes.
