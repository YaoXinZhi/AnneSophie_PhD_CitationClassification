Okay, let's break down this step by step. First, I need to look at the context around the citation to understand what's being referenced. The passage says, "The first step consisted of culturing the pathogen on solidified potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium supplemented with 200mg/L chloramphenicol, as previously described @@CITATION@@." 

Here, the authors are talking about their method of culturing a pathogen on a specific medium supplemented with chloramphenicol. The citation here is referred to as "previously described," which usually means the cited work explained that method before the current study. 

In the second step, I have to identify the general intent. Using the predefined categories, this seems to be about supporting their current methodology by referencing a prior explanation. That aligns with the Support category because they're confirming their approach by citing something that's already established the method.

In step three, I need to narrow it down to the most specific rhetorical class. The Support class is correct here since the citation is used to support the current experiment's methodology by referencing a previously described method.
