Okay, let's start breaking this down. The task is to classify the citation in the given passage according to the predefined rhetorical classes. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage is:

"@@CITATION@@ demonstrated that a new method for detecting plant diseases significantly reduces false positives compared to traditional methods. Our approach refines this method by incorporating machine learning algorithms to further improve accuracy."

So the context is about the cited work introducing a method that reduces false positives in plant disease detection, and the current work builds on it by adding machine learning algorithms.

Next, identify the intent. The citation is referring to the foundational work that introduced a method which the current research refines. The example given for 'Basis' is when a citation references the intellectual foundation. The cited work's method is the base upon which the current study improves. This seems to align with 'Basis' because the current research is building upon or replicating the foundation laid by the cited work.

Looking at other possibilities: 'Support' would be if they're confirming existing results, but here it's more about building upon. 'CoCoGM' involves comparing goals or methods, but the example here isn't a comparison between their own methods with the cited one but an enhancement. 'Motivation' would be about justifying the research because of a gap, which isn't the case here. 'Usage' is about using a method directly, which is possible, but the example here is more about refining it rather than directly applying the same method.

The example given for 'Basis' mentions replicating results, which is similar to how the current paper refines the previous method. So the classification here should be 'Basis'.
