Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. The task is to determine the rhetorical class of the given citation in the context provided.

First, I need to extract the part of the text that discusses the citation. The passage around the @@CITATION@@ mentions: "Similarly, a small aphid gut binding peptide was shown to interfere with enamovirus uptake from pea aphid gut into the hemocoel; the peptide also bound to gut epithelia of two other aphid species suggesting potential broader applicability @@CITATION@@." 

Looking at this context, the phrase "suggesting potential broader applicability" is key here. The authors are pointing out that the findings of the cited work indicate possibilities for future research or applications beyond what was originally studied. This seems to imply that the cited study's results open up avenues for further investigation.

Next, identifying the general intent. The example under the 'Future' class mentions suggesting directions for future research. The cited work's results are highlighting broader applicability, which hints at possible future studies or applications in other aphid species, as mentioned in the example. This matches the 'Future' rhetorical class's definition of suggesting future directions based on the cited work's findings.

The example provided for 'Future' states that citing works have promising results that imply future research areas. Here, the cited study's findings on the peptide's binding to other species indicate that there's potential for broader research, aligning perfectly with the 'Future' category. Therefore, the rhetorical class for the citation is 'Future'.
