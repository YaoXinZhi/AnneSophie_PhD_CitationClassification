Okay, let's try to go through this step by step. So, the task is to determine the rhetorical class of the citation tagged @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. The available classes are things like Basis, CoCoGM, etc.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage is: "Previous research has demonstrated that certain plant pathogens exhibit resistance mechanisms against common fungicides. For example, @@CITATION@@ reported a significant increase in resistance among fungal strains to azole compounds, prompting the need for new management strategies in this study." 

So the context here is that the citation is being used as an example of previous research that found resistance in fungal strains to azole fungicides, which then leads to the need for new strategies in the current study. 

Next, the general intent. The phrase "prompting the need for new management strategies" suggests that the citation is motivating the current research. The cited work is showing a problem (resistance increase) that the current study is addressing. According to the step 2 categories, this falls under Motivational intent because it's justifying why the current research is being conductedâ€”there's a knowledge gap or a need identified by the cited work.

Looking at the specific rhetorical classes under Motivation, the example given is about previous research showing a phenomenon and explaining why the current work is necessary. The example in the Motivation class says the citation justifies the need for the current research. Here, the citation does exactly that by pointing out increased resistance, prompting the need for new strategies. Therefore, the correct label should be Motivation.
