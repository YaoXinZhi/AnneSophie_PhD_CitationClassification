Okay, let's tackle this classification problem step by step.

First, I need to extract the relevant context around the citation @@CITATION@@. Let's look at the passage:

"The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@."

So the citation is being used to compare the results of the current study with the ones from the cited paper. The key phrase here is "substantially differ from the results of the experiments," which directly points to a comparison of results.

Next, determining the general intent. Since the paper is contrasting their findings with previous ones, that falls under the Comparative category. Comparing results would map to the 'CoCoRes' class as per the definitions provided.

Looking at the example given for CoCoRes, it directly matches the scenario where results are compared, just like in the example provided: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results..." which is exactly the structure here.

So, based on the context and the definitions, the most appropriate label is CoCoRes.
