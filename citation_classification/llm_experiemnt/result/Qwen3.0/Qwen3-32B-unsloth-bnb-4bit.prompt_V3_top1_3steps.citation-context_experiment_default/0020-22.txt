Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. The citation in question is in the passage provided. First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The sentence reads: “Our results are in contrast to previously described results for other phytoplasma strains that were found to proliferate in young growing parts of their hosts, such as shoots and roots (Wei et al., 2004; Saracco et al., 2006; @@CITATION@@).” 

Now, looking at the surrounding text, the authors are contrasting their findings with prior studies. Specifically, they mention conflicting results from another study cited at the mention point. The key here is that they're comparing their results to those cited works.

Next, identifying the general intent. Since the authors are contrasting their results with results from the cited work, this aligns with the "Comparison of Results" category. The example given for CoCoRes involves comparing results between the current work and the cited work. Here, the authors directly state their results differ from those cited. 

So, the rhetorical class should be CoCoRes as they are directly comparing their findings with the cited study's results to highlight a contrast.
