Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the rhetorical class of the citation here. The passage is about plant health, specifically something related to phytoplasma in daisy plants causing symptoms. The citation is mentioned among other studies. Let me parse the sentence: "...Fast multiplication rates and high concentration... in young leaves and roots...(Wei et al., 2004; Saracco et al., 2006), although conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima @@CITATION@@."

So the context is comparing different studies on phytoplasma. The authors are citing Wei et al. and Saracco et al. who reported certain findings, but there's a conflicting result mentioned by the cited paper under @@CITATION@@. The key here is that they're contrasting the cited study's conflicting results with the previous mentions. According to the definitions, CoCoXY is when the citation compares explanations or claims between two cited studies, not involving the current paper. Since the sentence is discussing conflicting results between the cited works mentioned (Saracco et al., Wei et al.) and the cited paper at @@CITATION@@, CoCoXY fits here because it's comparing different studies' claims. The example given in CoCoXY also involves comparing two cited studies with conflicting results, while the citing paper doesn't align their own findings but discuss the two cited ones. Therefore, the label should be CoCoXY.

#Step 1: Extract semantic context: "Fast multiplication rates and high concentration of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains... reported in young leaves and roots... although conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima @@CITATION@@".

#Step 2: General intent - Comparative (the citation is used to highlight conflicting results between different studies on phytoplasma).

#Step 3: Specific rhetorical class - CoCoXY (Comparison of Explanations or Claims between cited studies Wei et al., 2004/Saracco et al., 2006 vs. cited work at @@CITATION@@).

CoCoXY
