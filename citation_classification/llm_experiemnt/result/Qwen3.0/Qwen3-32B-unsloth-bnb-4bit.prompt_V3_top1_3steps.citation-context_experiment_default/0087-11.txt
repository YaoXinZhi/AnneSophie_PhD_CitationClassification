Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in the given passage. First, the context around the citation is: "To assess the impact of climate change on the spread of the invasive species Japanese stiltgrass (Microstegium vimineum), we utilized a mechanistic model developed by @@CITATION@@."

Step one is extracting the relevant context. The key part here is "utilized a mechanistic model developed by @@CITATION@@." The citation is referring to a model that was developed, which the current study is using.

Next, identifying the general intent. The study is using a method or tool from the cited work. The term "utilized a mechanistic model developed by" points towards technical usage. According to the guidelines, if the citation is about using a method, tool, dataset, etc., it falls under "Usage."

Then, selecting the specific rhetorical class. The example under "Usage" mentions using an experimental setup described in a previous work. Similarly, here, the mechanistic model is a tool or method directly used in the current study. So the correct class should be "Usage."
