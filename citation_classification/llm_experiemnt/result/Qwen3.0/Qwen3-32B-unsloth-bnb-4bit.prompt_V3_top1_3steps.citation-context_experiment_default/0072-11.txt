Okay, let me try to figure out the correct classification for the given example. The task is to assign the rhetorical class based on the context of the citation.

Looking at the Neutral example provided: “In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@.” Here, the citation is simply stating a fact about the spread of magnetic water treatment devices in the USA since 1975. There's no indication of comparing methods, supporting a claim, motivating further research, or criticizing the cited work. The author is just providing a reference to an existing fact or data without adding any specific argument or analysis. So the citation is used in a neutral, descriptive manner.
