Okay, let's see. The task is to figure out the rhetorical class of the cited work in the given passage. First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage is: "This phenomenon resembles the host-selective toxins (HSTs) described by @@CITATION@@ in some pathogenic fungi that target specific host pathways." 

So the citation is right after "described by". The context is that the authors are saying their phenomenon is similar to host-selective toxins mentioned in the cited work. The key word here is "resembles," which suggests a similarity. The cited work is being referenced to show that their finding is alike to previous findings.

Next step is identifying the intent. Since they're pointing out a resemblance or similarity, this falls under the Supportive category. But wait, the specific classes under Supportive are Support and Similar. The difference is that Support is when they confirm their own work with the cited, while Similar is pointing out similarities between their work and others. Here, the authors state that their phenomenon resembles the HSTs from the cited work, which directly points out a similarity. So according to the example given for Similar, which talks about findings that are similar in patterns or phenomena, this should be the Similar class. 

Examples help: The Similar example says something like "Our finding... is supported by recent..." and points out similarity. Here it's similar but stated as "resembles," which aligns with Similar. So the rhetorical class is Similar.
