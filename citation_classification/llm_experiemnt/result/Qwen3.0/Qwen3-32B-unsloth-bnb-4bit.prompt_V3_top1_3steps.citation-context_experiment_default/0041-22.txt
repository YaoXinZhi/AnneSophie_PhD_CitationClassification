Okay, let's see. The task is to classify the citation@@CITATION@@ in the given scientific passage. First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage says, “@@CITATION@@ developed a method to detect the presence of 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' in plant tissues using qPCR. Our study applied this method to a different set of samples to confirm its reliability under varied conditions.”

So the key part here is that the cited work developed a qPCR method, and the current study used that method on their samples to confirm reliability. The intent here seems to be that the authors are supporting their own study by referencing a previously established method. They’re not comparing results or methods directly with their own, but rather using the cited method as a basis for their own work. 

Looking at the rhetorical classes, 'Support' is when the citation is used to back up the current work's findings. In this case, by applying the cited method, they're supporting their confirmation of reliability. Alternatively, 'Usage' refers to using a method, tool, etc., from the cited work. The example for 'Usage' mentions an experimental setup being described in a previous study. Here, the method developed by the citation is directly applied, so maybe that's 'Usage'. 

Wait, the example under 'Support' says, “All subscales were consistent with previous research, particularly that of @@CITATION@@...”. That's similar to confirming consistency. But in this case, the authors are applying the method from the citation. So perhaps 'Usage' fits better because they're using the method. 

But the example for 'Usage' is about an experimental setup described previously. Here, it's a method (qPCR) developed by the citation. So maybe 'Usage' is correct here. However, sometimes 'Support' is about confirming results. Wait, the current study is applying the method to confirm its reliability, so they’re using the method (Usage) and by doing so, supporting their reliability claim (Support). 

Hmm, maybe both could apply. But according to the definitions, 'Usage' is when the cited work's method is directly used. The example under Usage mentions the experimental setup was described previously. So in this case, applying the method would be 'Usage'. Therefore, the correct classification should be 'Usage'.
