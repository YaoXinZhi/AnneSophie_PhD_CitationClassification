Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the rhetorical class of the citation tagged in this passage. First, I should extract the context around the citation. The passage is talking about the impact of different phytoplasma strains on daisy plants and contrasting that with findings from a study by Wei et al., 2004 and Saracco et al., 2006 versus another study by @@CITATION@@ in Euphorbia pulcherrima. The key phrase here is "conflicting results were described..." so they're comparing two different studies. 

The citation is being used here to compare explanations or claims between two studies, not the citing paper itself. The example given for CoCoXY mentions comparing two cited studies, which matches this scenario. The authors are pointing out conflicting results between the two studies they mention. So according to the definitions, CoCoXY is when the citation is used to compare explanations or claims of two cited works with each other, not with the current paper. The example provided in the instruction about conflicting results in phytoplasma studies aligns exactly with this case. Therefore, the correct label should be CoCoXY.
