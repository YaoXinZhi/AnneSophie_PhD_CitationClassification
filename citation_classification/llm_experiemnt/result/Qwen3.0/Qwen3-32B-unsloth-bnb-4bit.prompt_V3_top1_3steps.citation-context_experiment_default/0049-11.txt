Okay, let me try to work through this step by step. The user wants me to classify the citation in the given passage into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation tag. Let me look at the example passage again. Here's the passage:

```  
 @@CITATION@@ demonstrated the effectiveness of using remote sensing for early detection of citrus canker. We implemented their methodology using hyperspectral imaging to enhance detection accuracy.  
```

The citation is mentioned first, followed by "demonstrated...", which suggests that the cited work established a foundational approach. Then the authors of the current paper say they implemented their methodology but with a different technique (hyperspectral imaging). 

Next, identifying the general intent. The citation is introduced as showing effectiveness, and their work builds upon it by using a different method. So the intent is comparativeâ€”comparing methods perhaps? Or is it supporting?

Looking at the options: If the intent is foundational, it's Basis. But the example given for Basis has the citation introducing a validated method that the current work replicates. However here, the authors are enhancing the method with hyperspectral imaging. 

Wait, CoCoGM refers to comparing goals or methods. Since they are contrasting their method (hyperspectral) with the cited method (remote sensing), this might fall under CoCoGM. But the example for CoCoGM involves a method the cited paper proposed and the current paper's complementary approach. Here, they're using a different imaging technique but building on the cited work's methodology. 

Alternatively, if the cited work's method is the foundation upon which they build, maybe it's Basis. But the Basis example is more about replication. In this case, they're modifying the method, so maybe more comparative. 

Another angle: Support could be if they are supporting their approach with previous work. But here it's about enhancing accuracy using a different technique. So perhaps CoCoGM, comparing methods. 

Alternatively, Usage if they are directly using the methodology from the cited work, but they are modifying it. The Usage example uses a dataset. So CoCoGM seems likely here.
