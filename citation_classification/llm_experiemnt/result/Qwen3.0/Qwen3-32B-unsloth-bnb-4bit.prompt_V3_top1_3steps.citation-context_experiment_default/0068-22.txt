Okay, let's tackle this. First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage says: "Similar results were also obtained by @@CITATION@@ who studied the effect of magnetic treatment on scale formation in industrial cooling water systems." The key part here is "Similar results were also obtained by..." which directly points to similarity between the cited work and the current study.

Next, identify the general intent. Since it's pointing out similar results from another study, this falls under Supportive intent. Looking at the options, Supportive includes 'Support' and 'Similar'. 

Now, checking the fine-grained classes. The example under Similar mentions pointing out similarities between cited work and citing paper. The given example there has a direct similarity like "insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly... supported by..." which mirrors the structure here where similar results are mentioned. 

Therefore, the correct label is 'Similar'.
