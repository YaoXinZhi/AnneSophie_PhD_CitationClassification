Okay, I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the given citation in this scientific passage. Let me start by reading the passage carefully.

The passage around the citation says: “The use of genomic resources to study pathogen population structure has become widespread in plant pathology (@@CITATION@@). Here, we present…” 

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The key part is mentioning that genomic resources use is widespread in plant pathology and citing some work. The authors are using this citation to establish that this approach is common or foundational before presenting their own work.

Next, determining the intent. The citation here seems to reference the existing practice or groundwork that their current research builds upon. They aren't comparing methods or results with another study; they're pointing out that this is a common approach in the field. The example under the 'Basis' class matches this—referring to foundational work that the current research is building on. 

The citation isn't for support of their own results but rather to show that this area is established. So the rhetorical class here would be Basis because it's citing foundational research that sets the stage for their study.
