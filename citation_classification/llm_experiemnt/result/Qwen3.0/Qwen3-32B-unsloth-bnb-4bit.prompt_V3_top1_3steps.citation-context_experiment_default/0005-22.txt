Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation in the given passage. The citation is mentioned in the passage: "In the present studyâ€¦ and the results presented here confirm previously reported symptoms of root necrosis caused during drought in herb species from the Iberian Peninsula (Vereecke et al., 2009) @@CITATION@@." So the relevant context is that the current study's results confirm previous findings about root necrosis symptoms during droughts in herb species from the Iberian Peninsula as reported by Vereecke et al., 2009.

Next, identifying the general intent. The authors are confirming previously reported symptoms, which suggests they are supporting their current results with prior research. The key here is that they are using the citation to back up their own findings, showing alignment with existing results.

Now, determining the specific rhetorical class. The options for supportive contexts are Support or Similar. Support is when the citation supports the work, result, or finding of the citing authors. In this case, the current results confirm what was previously reported, so this is a supportive reference. The example given for Support mentions consistency with previous research and confirmation. Therefore, the correct class here should be "Support."
