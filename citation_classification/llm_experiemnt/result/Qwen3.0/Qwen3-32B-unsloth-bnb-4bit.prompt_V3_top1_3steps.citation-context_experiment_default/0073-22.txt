Okay, let me try to figure out the rhetorical class for this citation. First, I need to look at the context around the citation in the passage. The user provided a specific example where they mention that the results obtained in their work differ from experiments using deuterium saturated metal targets as cited. The example is labeled as CoCoRes because it's comparing results.

In the current problem, the passage says, “The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@.” So the key point here is that they are contrasting their own results with those from the cited study. 

Comparing results directly falls under CoCoRes according to the definitions given. The user's example for CoCoRes is almost identical to this case, where they mention differing results. The intent here is to show contrast in findings, which is exactly what CoCoRes is for. It's not supporting their own findings (which would be Support) or motivating new research (Motivation). The cited work's results are being compared directly, so CoCoRes is the right class here.
