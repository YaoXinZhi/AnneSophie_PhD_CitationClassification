Okay, let me tackle this classification problem. So the user provided a passage with a citation marked as @@CITATION@@, and I need to assign the most appropriate rhetorical class to it. The possible classes are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Motivation, Future, Support, Similar, Usage, Weakness, Neutral.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The given passage is: "Our previous research @@CITATION@@ has shown that the formation of the hard calcite scale on the surfaces exposed to hard water can be successfully prevented with the applied magnetic field. The explanation of the phenomena is not yet offered and the purpose of this work is to try to understand the mechanism of the beneficial influence of the magnetic treatment."

So the citation here is referring to the author's own previous research. The first part says "Our previous research @@CITATION@@ has shown..." which suggests that this citation is providing the foundation for the current study. The key phrase here is "has shown," indicating that the previous work established something that the current paper is building upon. The second sentence states that the explanation isn't yet offered, and this work aims to understand the mechanism. 

Looking at the general intent, the citation seems to be pointing to foundational work that the current research is based on. According to the definitions, the Basis class is when the citation references the intellectual foundation of the current research. That fits here because the authors are referring to their own prior findings which serve as the basis for the new study's purpose. 

Comparing to other classes: Motivation could be a possibility since they mention the purpose of the current work is to address something not yet explained from the previous research. But the example given for Motivation includes phrases like "justify why the current research is being conducted," which aligns more with the example provided. However, the citation here is introducing prior work that the current study builds on, not justifying the need but rather stating what's already been done. 

The example under Basis mentions replicating results from previous work, but in this case, the authors are citing their own previous work as the foundation for the current one. So Basis seems correct here.
