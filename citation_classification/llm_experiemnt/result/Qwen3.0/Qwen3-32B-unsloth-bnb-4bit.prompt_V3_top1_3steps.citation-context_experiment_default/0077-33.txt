Okay, let's see. I need to classify the citation in the given passage. The passage is about plant health, so probably related to a scientific paper citing another work.

The citation is in a sentence that says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@."

The example given for CoCoRes is similar: comparing results of the current work with cited experiments. The example's structure is identical, where the present results differ from those in the cited work. The key phrase here is "substantially differ from the results... @@CITATION@." That's directly comparing results.

So the intent here is to compare results, which points to CoCoRes. The other options like CoCoGM would involve methods or goals, but here it's clearly about results. Motivation would be about justifying the current work, which isn't the case here. Support would be if they were confirming something, but it's about differences. So CoCoRes is the correct label.
