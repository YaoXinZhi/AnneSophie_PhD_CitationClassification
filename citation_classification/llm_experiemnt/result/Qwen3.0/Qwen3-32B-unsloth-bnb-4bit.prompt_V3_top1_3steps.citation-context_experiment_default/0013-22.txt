Okay, let's break down this step by step. The user wants me to classify the citation reference in the given passage into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. 

First, I need to extract the context around the @@CITATION@@ tag. The passage is talking about the presence of 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains in young leaves and roots of infected daisy plants, citing Wei et al., 2004; Saracco et al., 2006. Then it mentions conflicting results regarding a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima, which is followed by the @@CITATION@@ tag. 

The example under CoCoXY involves comparing conflicting results between two studies without relating them to the current paper. Here, the authors are contrasting Wei et al. and Saracco et al.'s findings with another study's on Euphorbia pulcherrima, pointing out conflicting results. This fits CoCoXY because the citation is used to compare different explanations or claims between studies.

So, the intent here is Comparative, specifically comparing conflicting results as mentioned in CoCoXY. Neither the current paper's methods nor results are directly compared, so CoCoXY is the right label.
