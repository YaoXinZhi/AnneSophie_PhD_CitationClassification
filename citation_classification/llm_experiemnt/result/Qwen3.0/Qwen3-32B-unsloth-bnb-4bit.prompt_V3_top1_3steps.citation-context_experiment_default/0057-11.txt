Okay, let me tackle this classification step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage says: "The effectiveness of this strategy has been demonstrated by previous studies (e.g., @@CITATION@@ using similar genetic markers)." 

So the surrounding semantic context is about previous studies showing the strategy's effectiveness with similar genetic markers. Now, identifying the general intent here. They're supporting their own claims by referencing prior work that also demonstrated effectiveness. The citation is used to back up their strategy's validity. That seems like a supportive role.

Looking at the options, Support is when the citation confirms the work's validity. The example given in the instructions matches this scenario where previous research supports their findings. Since they mention "similar genetic markers," theyâ€™re showing alignment with prior results. So the rhetorical class here should be Support.
