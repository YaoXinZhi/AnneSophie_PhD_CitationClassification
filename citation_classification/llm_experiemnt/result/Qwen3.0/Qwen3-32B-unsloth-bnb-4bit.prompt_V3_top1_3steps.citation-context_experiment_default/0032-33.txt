Okay, let's tackle this citation classification. First, I need to extract the context around the @@CITATION@@. The passage says, "The role of microbial communities in plant health has been increasingly recognized (Dodd, 2013). In a recent study, Dodd et al. (2020) further explored microbial interactions @@CITATION@@." 

Step 1: The semantic context here is about building upon Dodd's earlier work from 2013, specifically mentioning a recent study by Dodd et al. in 2020 that explored microbial interactions. The citation is within the same author's newer work.

Step 2: The intent seems to be foundational because the cited work by Dodd (2013) is referenced as the basis for subsequent research. The mention of Dodd et al. (2020) furthering the exploration suggests that the older work provided the foundation. 

Step 3: Comparing to the examples, the Basis category fits here. The example given for Basis mentions introducing and validating a method, which is similar to how Dodd's 2013 work lays the groundwork for later studies. The newer study builds upon the older one, so the citation is foundational.
