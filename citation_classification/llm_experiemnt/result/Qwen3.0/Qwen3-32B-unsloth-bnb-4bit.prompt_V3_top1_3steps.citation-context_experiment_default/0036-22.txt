Okay, let's tackle this citation classification step by step.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage is about the distribution of a pathogen in different parts of plants. The sentence mentions that the presence of Ca. Phytoplasma asteris was first noted in China by a previous study (Chen et al., 1987) and later reported in other species (Wei et al., 2004). The current citation is pointing to the conflicting results described by CABI, 2003-2008. 

Next, identifying the general intent. The authors are contrasting their findings with existing studies. They mention conflicting results from CABI regarding a different phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima. This comparison is to highlight differences in findings between studies, so the intent seems comparative. 

Now, determining the specific rhetorical class. Since they're comparing the cited study's results with another cited work (and not directly with their own paper), it falls under CoCoXY, where the citation is used to contrast two cited studies. 

So the final classification should be CoCoXY.
