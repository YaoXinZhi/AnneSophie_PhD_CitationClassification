Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. First, I need to understand the context around the citation marked with @@CITATION@@ in the given passage.

The passage provided is:

"Diseases caused by Xylosma yellow mottle virus have been reported on 30 species in 13 plant families from many countries in Asia and Africa including India, China, Bhutan, and Pakistan (Hsu et al., 2011). In China, the disease was recorded as early as in the 1980s and in recent years the disease was found in Fujian, Guangdong, Jiangxi provinces infecting mainly Xylosma species. The virus was transmitted by @@CITATION@@ and grafting and mechanical sap inoculation experiments confirmed the disease to be caused by a virus (Ling, 2008)."

The citation is about the transmission of the virus. The sentence says "The virus was transmitted by @@CITATION@@ and grafting...", followed by confirming the cause via grafting and mechanical sap experiments.

Now, extracting the context around the citation. The author is discussing how the virus spreads, mentioning that it's transmitted by the cited work's method, along with grafting. Then they confirm the cause through experiments. So the intent here seems to be providing a known method of transmission, establishing foundational knowledge for their own study's confirmation via experiments. 

Looking at the classification options: Basis refers to foundational or background references. Since the citation is introducing a transmission method that's part of the existing knowledge the authors are building upon (alongside grafting) to confirm their findings, this seems like foundational context. The cited work is not being compared to their methods, nor are they critiquedâ€”it's presented as established research that Ling's experiments later confirm. 

Therefore, the rhetorical class here is Basis.
