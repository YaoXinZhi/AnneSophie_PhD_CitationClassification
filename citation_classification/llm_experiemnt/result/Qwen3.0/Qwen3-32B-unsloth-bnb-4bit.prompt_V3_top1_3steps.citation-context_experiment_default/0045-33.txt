Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. The passage provided is about plant parasitic nematodes in the genus Meloidogyne, and they're using a specific method involving RNAi markers to track the effects of dsRNA on plant resistance. The citation is tagged here.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The authors mention that their system is based on RNAi markers introduced by another study referenced with @@CITATION@@. They replicate this system in a different species and show that the marker works similarly, leading to resistance loss.

The general intent here seems to be establishing foundational work. The cited study introduced the RNAi markers, which the current research builds upon. The authors are replicating and extending that work. So the rhetorical class would likely be Basis, as they're referencing the foundational method they're using.

Looking at the examples for Basis: the citation introduces and validates a method that the current study replicates. That matches here. The cited work (@@CITATION@@) introduced the IAT method, similar to how the current study uses the RNAi marker system from previous work. Therefore, Basis is the appropriate class here.

Step 1: Extract context  
The citation references a previous RNAi marker system introduced by @@CITATION@@ which was replicated in this study to track dsRNA effects in plant parasitic nematodes of the genus Meloidogyne.

Step 2: Identify intent  
Foundational - The cited work introduced the RNAi marker system that forms the intellectual foundation for the current research replication and extension in a different nematode species.

Step 3: Assign rhetorical class  
Basis
