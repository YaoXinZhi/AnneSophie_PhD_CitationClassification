Okay, let me try to figure out the rhetorical class for this citation. 

First, I need to look at the context around the citation. The sentence is: "However, the specific mechanism leading from the expression of these genes to symptoms remains to be elucidated. @@CITATION@@ described a similar disease in a related species."

So the authors mention that a certain mechanism isn't clear yet. Then they cite another work that described a similar disease in a related species. The citation is placed after stating that the mechanism isn't known, so maybe they're referring to that previous study to show a similarity. 

Looking at the classes, "Similar" is used when the cited work is pointed out as similar to the current paper's findings. The example given is about insect hosts affecting bacteria, which seems similar in intent here. The cited study talks about a similar disease in a related species, which points out a similarity between the works. 

The "Support" class would be if they're confirming their own results with the cited study, but here it's more about similarity rather than supporting their claims. "CoCoRes" is for comparing results, but the example here doesn't mention their own results being compared, just the existence of a similar disease. 

So I think the correct class here is "Similar".
