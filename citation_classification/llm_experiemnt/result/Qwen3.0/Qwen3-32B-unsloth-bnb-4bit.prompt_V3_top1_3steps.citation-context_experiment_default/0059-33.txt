Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to look at the given passage and identify where the citation is placed. The user provided the passage: "This technique was described in detail previously @@CITATION@." 

In Step 1, I extract the context around the citation. The sentence structure tells me that the authors are referring to a previously described technique, and they're citing the source where it was detailed. There's no mention of comparing methods, supporting results, motivating further work, or any criticism. The focus is on the fact that the technique was already detailed in prior work.

Moving to Step 2, I need to determine the intent. The phrase "has been described previously" indicates that they're pointing out where the technique was introduced before. This seems like they're referencing the original source (intellectual foundation) where the technique was established. According to the definitions provided under Step 2, if the citation references the foundation of the current research, it's classified as "Basis." 

Looking into the examples for Basis, like "introduced and validated the IAT," it matches the scenario here where the cited work is where the technique was first detailed. Therefore, the correct label here is Basis. I don't see elements that would fall into Support, Similar, or Usage because it's not supporting their findings, pointing out similarities, or mentioning the use of a method. Hence, the most accurate classification here is Basis.

`"@CLASS@": "Basis"`
