Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the given citation. The passage is: "The development of disease symptoms in plants infected with the causal agent of grapevine red blotch disease (GRBD) is influenced by various factors, including the specific grapevine cultivar and the environmental conditions present during infection as demonstrated previously @@CITATION@@. In this study..." 

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The sentence mentions that the development of disease symptoms in GRBD is influenced by factors like cultivar and environmental conditions, and refers to previous work showing this. The citation is used here to back up the statement that these factors influence symptom development. 

Next, I need to determine the intent. The authors are presenting existing findings that support their current study's context. They're using the citation to confirm that previous research had already demonstrated these influencing factors. From the examples, Support is when the citation is used to support the citing authors' work or findings. Here, the authors are setting the groundwork by referencing prior studies that show the factors affecting GRBD symptoms. This seems like Support because they're corroborating their claim with existing literature.

Looking at the options, Support fits as they use the citation to validate the factors mentioned. Neutral might be if it's just a factual statement without supporting their argument, but here it's part of establishing why their study is relevant. So the correct class should be Support.
