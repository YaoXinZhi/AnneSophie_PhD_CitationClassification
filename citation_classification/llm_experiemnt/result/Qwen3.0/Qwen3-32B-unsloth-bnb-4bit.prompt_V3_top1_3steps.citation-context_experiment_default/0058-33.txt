Okay, let's tackle this citation classification problem step by step. The passage is:

"The application of integrated plant protection (IPM) strategies is essential for reducing chemical pesticide use while maintaining crop yield and quality (Smith et al., 2020) @@CITATION@@. Recent studies have highlighted the role of biological control agents in enhancing IPM efficacy @@CITATION@@."

First, I need to identify the context around the first @@CITATION@@. The surrounding text mentions Smith et al., 2020, who talk about the importance of IPM strategies in reducing pesticide use while maintaining yield and quality. The intent here seems foundational because they're establishing the basis for why IPM is important. The next citation is about recent studies highlighting biological control agents enhancing IPM efficacy. Comparing the two, the first citation is setting up the foundation for the research topic. The general intent is foundational, pointing to Basis. The second citation might be supportive or similar, but since we're focusing on the first one, Basis appears most accurate.
