Okay, let's look at this citation example. The sentence is explaining a phenomenon in daisy plants with different phytoplasma strains. The authors mention fast multiplication rates in certain plant parts but conflicting results. Then they cite the study with @@CITATION@@ for Euphorbia pulcherrima. 

So the main intent here is comparing different studies. They're contrasting Wei et al. and Saracco et al.'s findings with another study in Euphorbia. The citation isn't used for methods or results of the current paper. It's part of explaining conflicting results in different plants. That fits the comparison of explanations between cited studies themselves.

The class definitions mention CoCoXY when comparing two cited studies with each other, not the citing paper. Here, the current paper isn't comparing its own work but points out conflicting results between two studies mentioned. Wei et al., Saracco et al. found high concentration in daisies, while the cited study reported conflicting results in Euphorbia. The citation is part of explaining the conflict between explanations in different studies.

So according to CoCoXY's definition, this example is comparing explanations in cited works. The example given for CoCoXY was conflicting results between studies. In the context here, it's the same situation. Therefore, the correct rhetorical class is CoCoXY.
