Okay, let's start by looking at the passage provided. The citation is in the sentence: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The key part here is "substantially differ from the results of the experiments... @@CITATION@." So the author is comparing their results with those from the cited study.

Next, identify the general intent. The author mentions a substantial difference, which indicates they are contrasting their own findings with the previous ones. According to the guidelines, comparing results falls under the 'Comparative' category. Now, looking at the specific classes under comparative, CoCoRes is for comparing results directly. The example given for CoCoRes talks about differing results, which matches the context here. 

The cited work's results are being contrasted with the current paper's results. There's no mention of goals or methods, just the outcomes. Therefore, CoCoRes is the correct classification here.
