Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a citation passage and wants me to classify it into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. 

First, I need to look at the passage provided. The citation is in the context of a study that developed a methodology, as stated: "@@CITATION@@ developed a methodology..." Then it continues with the authors mentioning their own approach. 

Step 1 is extracting the context around the citation. The key part here is that the cited work proposed a methodology, and the current paper's authors present their own method. The sentence structure is comparing their approach to the cited one. 

Moving to Step 2, the general intent here seems to be comparative. The authors are contrasting their method with the one in the citation. The options for comparative are CoCoGM, CoCoRes, or CoCoXY. Since the comparison is about the goals or methods, it's likely CoCoGM. The example for CoCoGM mentions contrasting goals or methods, which fits here because they mention their focus is complementary. 

Finally, Step 3 is selecting the specific class. The example given for CoCoGM involves a comparison of methods, similar to how the current citation is used to compare the methodology. The current text says "Our work is complementary, as we focus instead..." which matches the example's style of contrasting methods. Therefore, CoCoGM is the correct classification.
