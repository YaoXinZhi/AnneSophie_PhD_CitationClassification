Okay, let's see. The passage mentions a study by @@CITATION@@ who identified specific genes in rice lines carrying P. oryzae race I3CR and 482. The authors are using this information to suggest the need for developing molecular detection assays. So the citation here is referencing previous work that found these genes. The intent seems to be motivating the current research because they're pointing out a problem (presence of these genes) and suggesting a solution (need for detection methods). That fits under Motivation since it's justifying why their research is needed.
