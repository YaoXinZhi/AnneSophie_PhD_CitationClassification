Okay, let's start by looking at the citation passage provided. The user has given a scientific article excerpt with a citation tag @@CITATION@@. My job is to figure out which rhetorical class this citation falls into based on the context.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage says, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." The key part here is that they are comparing their results with those from a previous study. 

Next, I need to identify the general intent. Since the sentence directly mentions that their results are different from the cited work's results, this seems like a comparison of results. The predefined categories include CoCoRes, which is specifically for comparing results or findings between the current work and the cited work.

Looking at the examples given for CoCoRes, the example is almost identical in structure: "The results obtained... substantially differ from the results... @@CITATION@." This matches closely with the provided passage. 

Now, I should check if any other categories might fit. "Basis" is about foundational work, which doesn't seem to be the case here. "CoCoGM" is about goals or methods, which isn't the focus here. "Motivation" would be about justifying the current research, but this is a direct comparison of results. "Support" would be confirming the current findings, but this is a contrast. "Similar" would indicate agreement, but the passage states substantial differences. "Weakness" involves criticism, which isn't present hereâ€”it's a neutral comparison. "Neutral" is for descriptive citations without argument, but here there's a clear comparison of results. 

Therefore, the correct category is CoCoRes.
