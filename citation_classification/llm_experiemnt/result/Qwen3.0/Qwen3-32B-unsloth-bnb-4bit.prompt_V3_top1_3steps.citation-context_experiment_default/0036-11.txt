Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to look at the provided citation passage and figure out what's going on. The passage says: "The results obtained here are in agreement with the earlier results reported by @@CITATION@@ who described a survey of plant pathogens infecting legume crops."

Starting with Step 1: Extracting the context around the citation. The key part here is that the authors are saying their results are in agreement with those from another study. The cited work is mentioned as having described a survey of plant pathogens infecting legume crops. So the context is that the current results align with previous findings from the referenced study.

Moving to Step 2: Identifying the general intent. When an author states their results are in agreement with earlier work, this usually suggests that they're supporting their findings with existing literature. According to the guidelines, this kind of agreement where the citation backs up the current work's results would fall under Supportive intent. Supportive includes confirming the work, results, or findings of the current authors using previous research.

Finally, Step 3: Assigning the specific rhetorical class. Looking at the classes, Support is the one where the citation is used to support or confirm the authors' work. The example given is where subscales were consistent with previous research. In our case, the agreement with earlier results means Support is the correct label here. There's no comparison, criticism, or motivationâ€”just confirmation through prior findings.
