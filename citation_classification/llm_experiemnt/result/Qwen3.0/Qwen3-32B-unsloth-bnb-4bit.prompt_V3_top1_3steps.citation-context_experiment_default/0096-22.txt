Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The user provided a passage where the citation is mentioned in the context of comparing two studies. The example given mentions "conflicting results were described..." with the citation pointing to a specific study. 

Next, identify the general intent. Since the sentence is highlighting conflicting results between two cited works (Wei et al., 2004; Saracco et al., 2006) and the cited study in the citation, it's about contrasting explanations or claims between studies. 

The CoCoXY class is for comparing two cited studies with each other, not directly with the current paper. The example mentions conflicting results in a different study, so this fits CoCoXY.

So the final class should be CoCoXY.
