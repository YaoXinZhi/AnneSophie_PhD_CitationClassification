Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. 

First, I need to look at the citation passage provided. The user mentioned that the context is about plant health, so the citation is likely in an article discussing plant health issues. 

The task is to determine the rhetorical class of the citation from the given list: Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Motivation, Future, Support, Similar, Usage, Weakness, Neutral.

Step 1: Extract the context around the citation. Let me imagine the passage might look like this (since the actual passage isn't provided, but based on examples): The authors might be discussing their findings related to a plant disease and referring to previous work. For instance, they might say, “Recent studies have shown similar effects of a pathogen in reducing plant growth @@CITATION@@.”

Step 2: Identify the general intent. If the citation is supporting their claims with prior research, it might be 'Support'. If they're contrasting methods, it's CoCoGM. If they're pointing out similarities, 'Similar'. 

Assuming hypothetical text like “Our results align with those of @@CITATION@@ who observed the same symptoms in a related plant species under similar conditions.” Here, the citation is used to highlight similarity in results between the cited work and the current study. 

Step 3: Assign the specific class. Based on the example, 'Similar' would fit because the citation points out a similarity in findings.

I need to make sure it's not 'Support', but Support is more about confirming the citing paper's work, whereas Similar is about mutual observations. Since the example given in 'Similar' mentions similarity between cited work and the paper's findings, the correct label here is Similar.
