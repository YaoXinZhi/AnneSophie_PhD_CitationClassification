Okay, let me try to work through this step by step. First, I need to look at the passage provided and identify where the citation is mentioned.

The passage is: “@@CITATION@@ described the symptoms of the pathogen as foliar yellowing, stunting, and vein clearing. These symptoms are similar to those observed in our study.”

Starting with Step 1: Extracting the context around the citation. The sentence says that the citation described certain symptoms, which are similar to those observed in their own study. The main point here is that their study notices symptoms that are similar to what was described before.

Step 2: Identifying the general intent. The authors are pointing out similarity between their findings and the cited work's findings. Comparing the results? Wait, looking at the options, "Similar" is when the citation points out similarity between the cited work and the current paper. While CoCoRes is comparing results directly. But here, the example given under "CoCoRes" is comparing experimental results between studies, whereas here the study is just stating similarity in symptoms. The example under "Similar" mentions similarity in findings, like "our finding... is supported... similarity" and the example provided under "Similar" says "supported by recent cross-taxon investigations... similarity". 

In this case, the authors are stating that their observed symptoms are similar to those described in the cited work. This seems to be pointing out a similarity between their study and the cited one. Therefore, under "Similar". But wait, the CoCoXY example is about comparing two cited studies with each other, not with the citing paper. Since "CoCoRes" is directly comparing cited work's results to the current paper. But in this case, the cited work's symptoms are similar to theirs. So maybe this is more about similarity in their own observations. So according to the definitions, "Similar" is when the citation points out similarity between the two studies.

So the correct rhetorical class here should be "Similar".
