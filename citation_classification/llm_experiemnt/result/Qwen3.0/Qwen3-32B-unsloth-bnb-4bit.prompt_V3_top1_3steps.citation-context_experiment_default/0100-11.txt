Okay, let's go through the process step by step. The task is to assign the correct rhetorical class to the citation in the given passage. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The example passage is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." 

So, the key part here is the phrase "substantially differ from the results of..." which indicates that the current work's results are being compared to a previous study's results.

Next, identifying the general intent. The citation is used here to compare the results of the current work with those from a previous study. According to the definitions provided, comparing results corresponds to the category CoCoRes (Comparison of Results). 

Looking at the examples for CoCoRes, it's similar: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results... @@CITATION@@" which matches the given context exactly. 

Therefore, the correct rhetorical class here should be CoCoRes.
