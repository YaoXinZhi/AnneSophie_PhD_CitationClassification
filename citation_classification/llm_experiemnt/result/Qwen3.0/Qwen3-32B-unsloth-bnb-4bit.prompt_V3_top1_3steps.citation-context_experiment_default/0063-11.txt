Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. The citation is mentioned in the text, and I need to figure out its rhetorical class.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The sentence says: “Several studies have reported successful use of resistant cultivars in combating stripe rust disease in wheat. For example, the use of the wheat cultivar 'Maresi' has been shown to reduce disease severity significantly @@CITATION@@.” 

So the context here is about a successful use of a resistant wheat cultivar called 'Maresi' reducing disease severity. The citation is used to support the example given in the sentence. The authors are citing a study where they demonstrated that 'Maresi' effectively reduces stripe rust in wheat.

Now, identifying the general intent. The citation provides evidence for the example they're giving, which supports their own discussion about the effectiveness of resistant cultivars. That points towards a supportive intent. The options under supportive are Support and Similar. 

In the Support class example, they mention that a previous study supports their findings. Here, the citation is supporting the example given by presenting their own findings of 'Maresi' reducing disease severity. It's not just a similarity between studies, but rather their own assertion is supported by the cited work's results. 

So the specific rhetorical class should be Support because the cited work directly confirms the example provided in the current paper.
