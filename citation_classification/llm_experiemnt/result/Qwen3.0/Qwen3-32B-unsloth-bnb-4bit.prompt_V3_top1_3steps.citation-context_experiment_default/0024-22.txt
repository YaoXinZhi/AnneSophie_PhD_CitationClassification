Okay, let's take this step by step. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation in question. The passage says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@."

So, the key part here is comparing the results from the current study to those from the cited work, stating they are "substantially differ." The comparison here is directly about the results of the two works.

Next, identifying the general intent. Comparing results falls under the category of Comparative. Looking at the specific subclasses of Comparative, the example given for CoCoRes involves comparing results of the cited work with the citing paper's results. The example provided mentions differing results between the two, which matches the context here where the authors state their results differ from the cited work.

Therefore, according to the definitions, this would be labeled CoCoRes. The other options like CoCoGM or CoCoXY compare methods or explanations, which isn't the case here. There's no criticism or support, just a direct result comparison.
