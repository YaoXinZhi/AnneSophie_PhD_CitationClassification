Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The task is to classify the citation in the given passage into the appropriate rhetorical class from the predefined list.

First, I need to extract the context around the @@CITATION@@. The user provided the passage: "The use of plant growth regulators (PGRs) has been shown to enhance resistance to abiotic stress in several crops. @@CITATION@@ demonstrated that the application of gibberellic acid improved drought tolerance in wheat by modulating osmotic adjustment and antioxidant enzyme activity."

Step 1: Extract context. The relevant part is that the citation is being used to show that gibberellic acid application improved drought tolerance in wheat through specific mechanisms mentioned (osmotic adjustment and antioxidant enzymes).

Next, identify the general intent. The authors are referencing another study that supports their own findings or confirms a specific result related to PGRs enhancing drought tolerance via certain mechanisms. This seems like support because the cited work's results are being used to back up the current statement.

Step 2: Determine intent. The citation here is likely 'Supportive' since they are using it to back up their claim about the effectiveness of PGRs in enhancing stress resistance by citing evidence from another study.

Step 3: Choose the specific rhetorical class. Looking at the examples, the 'Support' class involves the citation being used to confirm or support the current authors' work. The example given there mentions consistency with previous research. In this case, the cited work provides direct evidence of the effect, supporting the statement made before the citation. Therefore, 'Support' is the appropriate class.
