Okay, let me try to figure this out. The task is to determine the rhetorical class of the citation mentioned in the provided passage. First, I need to look at the context around the citation and understand why it's there.

The passage given is: `"The development of resistant varieties is one strategy to manage Phytophthora capsici on pepper plants [@@CITATION@@]."` 

Looking at this sentence, the citation is placed after mentioning that developing resistant varieties is a strategy to manage Phytophthora capsici on pepper plants. The sentence is presenting a strategy, and the citation is supporting that statement by referencing previous work that likely discusses this strategy.

Now, according to the task's steps, the general intent could be foundational (basis), comparative, motivational, supportive, etc. Here, the citation is used to back up the claim that resistant varieties are a strategy. The example for "Support" mentions that the citation is used to support or confirm the work of the citing authors. In this case, the citation is supporting the assertion made by referencing prior research on resistant varieties as a management strategy. 

Another thing to consider is whether it's motivational or future research. But in the given example under Motivation, the citation justifies why the research is conducted. Here, the sentence is stating a known strategy, using the citation to support that this strategy exists, rather than motivating the need for the current research. 

The Neutral example is more descriptive, like stating a fact without taking a stance. However, the example here isn't just stating a fact; it's supporting the idea that resistant varieties are part of the management strategy. 

So, based on the examples and definitions, the most fitting class here is Support because the citation is used to support the claim made in the sentence about resistant varieties being a strategy.
