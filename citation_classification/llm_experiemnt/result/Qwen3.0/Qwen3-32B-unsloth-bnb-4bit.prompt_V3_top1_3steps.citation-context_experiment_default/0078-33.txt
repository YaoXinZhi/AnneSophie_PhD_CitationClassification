Okay, let me try to figure this out step by step. The user provided a task where they need to classify a citation in a scientific passage into one of several rhetorical classes. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation @@CITATION@@. Looking at the example passage:

"Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly... was further supported by similar results in other arthropod systems... @@CITATION@@."

The key part here is "was further supported by similar results in other arthropod systems." The author is saying their own findings are supported by similar results found in other studies cited. The citation here is pointing out that there are other studies which found similar results, hence supporting the current work.

Next step is identifying the general intent. Since the citation is used to support the authors' own findings by referencing similar results from other studies, this falls under the "Supportive" category. The specific rhetorical class here would be "Support" because the cited work is being used to confirm or back up the current study's results. 

Looking at the examples provided for "Support": "All subscales were consistent with previous research, particularly that of @@CITATION@@..." which is similar to the current example where the findings are consistent or supported by prior research. 

I should check if there's a possibility of it being "Similar." The difference between "Support" and "Similar" is that "Support" is about confirming the current work's validity, whereas "Similar" points out a similarity between the cited work and the current work. In this case, the phrase "was further supported by similar results" combines both supporting and similarity. However, the key verb here is "supported," indicating that the main intent is to back up their findings rather than just noting a similarity. 

Therefore, the correct classification should be "Support."
