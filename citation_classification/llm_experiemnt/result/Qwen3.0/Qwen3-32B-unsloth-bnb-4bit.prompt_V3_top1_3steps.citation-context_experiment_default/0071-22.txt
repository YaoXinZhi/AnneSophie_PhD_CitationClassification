Okay, let's tackle this. So the task is to figure out the rhetorical class of the given citation. First, I need to look at the passage provided.

The passage says: `Based on previous studies @@CITATION@@, the authors proposed a new method.` 

Step 1: Extract the context around the citation. The important part here is "Based on previous studies @@CITATION@@", which sets up the foundation for the new method they propose.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The phrase "Based on" usually indicates that the cited work is foundational to the current research. The authors are using the previous studies to support their own new method. According to the definitions, if it's foundational, that points towards the "Basis" class. The example given for Basis mentions introducing and validating a method, which aligns here since they're using previous work as the basis for their new approach.

Step 3: Check against the options. The cited work here isn't being compared, supported, or criticizedâ€”it's serving as the foundation. So the correct label should be Basis.
