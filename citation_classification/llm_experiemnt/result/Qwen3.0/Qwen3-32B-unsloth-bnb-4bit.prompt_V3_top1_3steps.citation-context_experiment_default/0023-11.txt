Okay, let's see. The citation here is from the sentence: "In some cases, the pathogen may be disseminated along with the plant by the movement of infected plant material into a new area, a problem first identified by @@CITATION@@."

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The key part is that the citation is referring to the problem of pathogens being spread through infected plant material. The phrase "a problem first identified by [CITATION]" suggests that the cited work introduced or highlighted this issue.

Next, figuring out the intent. The authors are pointing out that this problem was identified by another study, which serves as the foundational reference for recognizing this method of pathogen spread. So it's about establishing the origin or foundation of the problem's identification.

Looking at the task categories, "Basis" refers to citing the intellectual foundation of the current research. Since the citation here is the first identification of the problem, it's setting the basis for understanding how pathogens spread via plant material. There's no comparison, support, motivation, etc., just establishing the origin point.

So the rhetorical class should be Basis.
