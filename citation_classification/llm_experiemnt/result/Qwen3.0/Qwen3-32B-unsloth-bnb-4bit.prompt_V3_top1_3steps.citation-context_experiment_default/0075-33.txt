Okay, let's tackle this classification problem step by step. First, I need to look at the context around the citation and figure out the intent. The given passage is: "Diseases were detected by double antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DAS-ELISA) following the procedure described by @@CITATION@@." 

So the citation is referencing a procedure used in the current study. The key phrase here is "procedure described by @@CITATION@@", which indicates that the cited work provided a method or technique that the authors are following. Looking at the predefined classes, the Usage class is defined as a citation referring to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup from the cited work used in the current study. 

The example provided for Usage mentions an experimental set-up described previously, which aligns with this context. The authors here are stating they followed a procedure from the cited source, which directly relates to using a method outlined in that work. There's no indication of comparison, support, motivation, or criticism here. It's simply about utilizing a method described elsewhere.

So the rhetorical class should be Usage.
