Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to look at the provided passage and the cited reference to determine the rhetorical class.

The citation is in the sentence: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." 

Step 1: Extracting the relevant context. The key part here is that the experimental set-up was previously described by the cited work. The authors are referring to their own prior setup that was detailed in an earlier publication.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The intent seems to be that they are mentioning a previous description of the setup. Since the setup is something they directly used from their prior work, this relates to the method or experimental design they employed again here.

Looking at the definitions, the Usage class is when a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup from the cited work is directly used in the current study. The example given for Usage is similar: referring to an experimental set-up described previously. 

Step 3: Selecting the specific rhetorical class. The cited work provides the experimental setup that the current study is using. Therefore, this should be classified as "Usage".
