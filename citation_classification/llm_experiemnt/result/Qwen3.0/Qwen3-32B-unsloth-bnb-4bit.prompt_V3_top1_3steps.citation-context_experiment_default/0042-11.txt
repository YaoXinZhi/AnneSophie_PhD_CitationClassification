Okay, let's start by looking at the given passage. The user wants me to classify the citation here into one of the specified rhetorical classes. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The sentence is: "These findings highlight the need for further studies examining the influence of environmental factors on pathogen development and disease expression, as has been proposed by @@CITATION@@." 

So the key part here is that the citation is referencing someone else's work that proposed the need for further studies on environmental factors influencing pathogens. The authors of the current paper are pointing out that their findings show the need for more research, and they mention that someone else has also proposed this.

Next, I need to figure out the intent. The citation is being used to justify the current research's motivation. The authors are saying that since this other study proposed the idea, it's a good direction to follow up on, hence motivating their own research. That fits under Motivation because they're citing to explain why their research is important or needed.

Now checking the definitions again. Motivation is when the citation is used to justify why the research is conducted, perhaps pointing to a knowledge gap or suggesting a need. The example given was about previous research showing something and the need to explain further. Here, the citation is used to show that someone else has already highlighted the importance of studying environmental factors, thus providing a basis for their own research motivation.

I should make sure it's not Future or another category. Future would be if they were pointing out directions for future work that their own study would take. But here, the citation is being used to support the motivation for their current research, not future steps beyond their study. So Motivation is correct.
