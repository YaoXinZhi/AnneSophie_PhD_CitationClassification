Okay, let's tackle this classification problem. First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage provided is about plant health, specifically discussing a fungal isolate's effectiveness against insects.

The sentence around the citation says, “@@CITATION@@ reported that isolate 23B-2R, a formulation of B. bassiana, was effective for controlling S. exigua.” The context mentions that the current study builds on previous work using B. bassiana but found lower mortality rates in a different region. 

So the citation here is referencing prior research that established the effectiveness of B. bassiana isolate 23B-2R against S. exigua. The current work is comparing their results with this previous finding, indicating they found lower effectiveness in their own study. This looks like a comparison of results. 

Looking at the options, the most fitting class would be CoCoRes since the citation is used to compare results between studies. The example given for CoCoRes talks about differing results between experiments, which aligns with this scenario. They are contrasting their findings with those reported in the cited work. 

I need to make sure it's not CoCoGM or another category. Since the focus is on the results (mortality rates) and the difference in findings, it's definitely about comparing results, not goals or methods. Therefore, CoCoRes is the correct label.
