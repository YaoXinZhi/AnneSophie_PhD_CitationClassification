Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the rhetorical class for this citation. The passage is talking about a study where they assessed gene expression differences using RNA-Seq, and they found some co-expression patterns associated with specific metabolite accumulations. The citation here is mentioned with the example of a previous study that reported similar results in another plant, which is @@CITATION@@, but the current work focuses on contrasting patterns in citrus. 

So first, I'll extract the context around the citation. The key phrases are "as recently reported for another plant@@CITATION@@", and then they mention contrasting their findings. Comparing their results with another study's. The intent here is to compare the observed results with what was found before. 

Looking at the classes, CoCoRes is for comparing results directly. The example given in CoCoRes mentions differing results from cited experiments. Here, the authors are pointing out similarities and contrasts in their results with another study. The CoCoRes examples involve direct comparison of results. Since the current work contrasts patterns with the cited study, this fits CoCoRes. 

Wait, the example under CoCoXY compares two cited studies with each other, not the cited study with the current one. In this case, the authors are comparing their own results with those of another study, so that's CoCoRes. The mention of contrasting patterns and their own findings versus the cited study's suggests CoCoRes applies here.
