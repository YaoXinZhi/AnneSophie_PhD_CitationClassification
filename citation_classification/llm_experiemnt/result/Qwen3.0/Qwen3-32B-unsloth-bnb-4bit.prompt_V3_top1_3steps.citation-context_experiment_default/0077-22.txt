Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. The given passage is:

"In the present study, a new species of *Alternaria* was isolated and identified from soybean seed in Japan. The characteristics were analyzed morphologically and genetically, and a multigene phylogeny of the genus *Alternaria* and representatives of *Alternariella* was constructed based mainly on ITS sequences as well as rpb1 and rpdA genes from strains obtained mainly from the current study and other reference strains. Other sequences deposited in the GenBank were retrieved for the phylogenetic tree. The sequence data of ITS, rpb1, and atp6-5 primers were also obtained in this study and the phylogenetic analysis was conducted by comparing with the sequence data of the species described elsewhere in previous studies @@CITATION@@."

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The key part is the sentence mentioning that the phylogenetic analysis compared with sequence data from previous studies. 

Next, identify the intent here. The citation is used to compare the current findings with prior work. Looking at the options, the comparative classes are CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY. Since the comparison is about the results of the analysis (comparing sequence data and phylogeny), it fits CoCoRes, which deals with comparing results or findings.

So, the appropriate class should be CoCoRes.
