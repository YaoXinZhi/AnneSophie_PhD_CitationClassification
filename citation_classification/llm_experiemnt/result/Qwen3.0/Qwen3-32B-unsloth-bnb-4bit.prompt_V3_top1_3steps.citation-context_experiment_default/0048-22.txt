Okay, let's see. I need to classify the citation in the given passage. The passage is:

"Citric acid has been widely used as chelating agent in agricultural practices to solubilize metal micronutrients in soil. @@CITATION@@ has shown that citric acid enhances the availability of iron and other micronutrients, thereby promoting plant growth."

First, extract the context around the citation. The sentence before the citation talks about citric acid being used as a chelating agent and solubilizing metal micronutrients. Then, the citation states that they showed citric acid enhances micronutrient availability and promotes plant growth.

So the citation here is providing support for the claim being made. The authors are referencing previous work that confirms the effect of citric acid on nutrient availability and plant growth. The intent is to back up their current discussion with existing research. The example in the Support class says the citation is used to support or confirm the work of the citing authors. This matches because the cited study is confirming that citric acid enhances availability, which supports the previous statement. So the rhetorical class should be Support.
