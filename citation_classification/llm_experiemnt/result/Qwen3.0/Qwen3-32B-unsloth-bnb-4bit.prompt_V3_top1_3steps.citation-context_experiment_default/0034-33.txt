Okay, let's break down this. The passage is about plant pathogens, specifically phytoplasmas causing diseases like aster yellows and grapevine yellows. The citation in question is @@CITATION@@. 

First, the context mentions that two studies by Wei et al. (2004) and Saracco et al. (2006) reported fast multiplication rates of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains in daisy plants. Then it says "although conflicting results were described..." referencing @@CITATION@@. This citation is talking about a different phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima.

The task here is to classify the rhetorical purpose. The key part is comparing conflicting results between the cited studies and the others. Since the cited work is contrasting explanations or claims between Wei et al., Saracco et al., and another study on a different species, the comparison is about different studies' explanations claims rather than the citing paper's own goals or results. 

Looking at the definitions, CoCoXY is when comparing explanations or claims between cited studies themselves, not directly with the citing paper. The example given in CoCoXY involves contrasting two cited studies with each other. Here, the citation is pointing out conflicting results between the previous studies and another one, which fits CoCoXY. It's not comparing methods/goals, results, nor supporting the current paper's work directly. So the correct class here is CoCoXY.
