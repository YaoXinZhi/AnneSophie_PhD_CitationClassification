Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user provided a passage with a citation and wants me to classify it into one of the rhetorical classes. Let's break down the steps.

First, the task is to extract the context around the citation. The citation is in the passage: "@@CITATION@@ studied the distribution of X and Y in several species, including P, but found conflicting results with another study by Alpha et al. (2020)." The key here is that the authors are comparing their results with another study. 

Next, identifying the general intent. Since the citation is about conflicting results with another study, it seems like a comparison of results. The example for CoCoRes mentions conflicting results, so that's a clue.

Then, the specific rhetorical class. The example under CoCoXY talks about conflicting results between two cited studies, not comparing with the current paper. Wait, in the example for CoCoXY, it's comparing two studies with each other. In the given text, the citation is comparing the cited work's results with another study (Alpha et al.), so it's a comparison between two cited studies. Therefore, this fits CoCoXY.

So the answer should be CoCoXY.
