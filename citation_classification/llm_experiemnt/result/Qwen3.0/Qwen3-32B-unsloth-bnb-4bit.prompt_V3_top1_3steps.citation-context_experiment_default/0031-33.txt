Okay, let me break this down. The user wants me to classify the citation's rhetorical class in the given passage. First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage says, "The identification of new pathogens requires rigorous methods to ensure accuracy. @@CITATION@@ developed a novel sequencing approach that has been widely adopted in the field."

Step 1 is extracting the relevant context. The key part here is that the citation is referring to a method developed by them which is now widely adopted. 

Next, Step 2 is identifying the general intent. The citation here is talking about a method they developed that's being used in the field. That sounds like it's supporting their current work by confirming that their approach is established and used. According to the definitions, "Support" is when the citation is used to support or confirm the work, result, or finding of the citing authors. Here, they mention their own method's adoption, which supports their current research by showing it's a validated approach.

Step 3 is selecting the specific rhetorical class. The example under Support says something like confirming previous research. In this case, they're referencing their own prior work's method being adopted, which supports their current study's credibility. So the correct label should be "Support".
