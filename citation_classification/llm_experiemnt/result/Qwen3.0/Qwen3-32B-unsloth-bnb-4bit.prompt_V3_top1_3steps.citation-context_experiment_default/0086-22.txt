Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. The task is to determine the rhetorical class of the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage is:

"The most significant symptoms of infection with P. agglomerans biovar 5 are internal leaf spots and internal red blotch in leaves, and internal red spot in the fruit cortex. Infection is usually associated with the presence of the pathogen in irrigation water and sprinkler systems, and the pathogen has been detected recently for the first time in several European countries. The occurrence of this pathogen is considered a serious problem for the salad industry in these regions [8].@@CITATION@@"

So the context is discussing the symptoms of infection caused by P. agglomerans biovar 5, mentioning internal leaf spots in leaves and fruit cortex, association with irrigation water and sprinkler systems, recent detection in European countries, and the problem it poses for the salad industry. The citation [8] is placed at the end of these statements.

Next, I need to identify the general intent. The authors are citing [8] to mention the problem's significance for the salad industry. This seems like they are pointing out the relevance or justification for their study, indicating why their research is neededâ€”in this case, because the pathogen is causing issues in European salad industries. That aligns with the Motivation rhetorical class since it's about justifying the research based on existing problems or knowledge gaps identified through the cited work.

Motivation is defined when the citation justifies why research is conducted, like identifying a knowledge gap or a problem that needs solving. Here, the citation is highlighting that the pathogen's occurrence is a serious problem, motivating further research or action. Therefore, the classification should be Motivation.
