Okay, let's tackle this citation classification task step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the citation mentioned in the passage. The passage provided is:

`Similar results were obtained by other authors who studied the infection of soybean plants with isolates obtained from wheat, barley, and corn.@@CITATION@@. They found that the symptoms caused by wheat stem rust races on dicotyledonous hosts were similar to those observed in monocots.`

The citation here is part of the first sentence, so the context is that the authors are referencing others who studied soybean infections from various cereals. The key point here is that similar results were obtained by other researchers, indicating a comparison of findings.

Next, identifying the general intent. The phrase "Similar results were obtained..." suggests that the cited work has results that align with the current study's findings. This falls under the Supportive intent since they are confirming similar outcomes. According to the definitions, Support is when the citation supports or confirms the work, and Similar is pointing out similarities between the cited work and the current paper. However, in the example for Similar, the cited work points out a similarity in findings, which is what's happening here. The example given for Similar is about finding insect hosts affecting community assembly, similar to what's observed in recent studies, which matches this scenario.

Comparing with Support, which is more about confirming previous results, whereas Similar is about pointing out similarities between the cited work and the current paper's observations. Here, the authors mention that other studies found similar symptoms, so it's highlighting a similarity in results. Therefore, the correct class should be "Similar."
