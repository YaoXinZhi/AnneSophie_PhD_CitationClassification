Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. The task is to determine the rhetorical class of the citation @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage provided is: “Similar findings suggesting a negative relationship between plant health parameters and phytoplasma infection levels were reported previously @@CITATION@@.” 

So the context is the author mentioning that similar findings were previously reported, specifically about a negative relationship between plant health parameters and phytoplasma infection levels.

Next, identify the general intent. The phrase “similar findings were reported previously” suggests that the citation is pointing out a similarity between the current work's findings and those in the cited study. The key word here is "similar," which aligns with the 'Similar' rhetorical class. 

Looking at the definitions, 'Similar' is when the citation points out a similarity between the cited work and the current paper, often regarding results, patterns, phenomena, or general observations. The example given in 'Similar' mentions findings in other insect-associated bacteria that support the current research, similar to pointing out shared results.

The citation here isn't comparing methods, goals, or results directly with the current paper but is instead noting similarity in observations or findings. There's no criticism, support for current argument beyond similarity, future work suggestion, or motivational context. 

Therefore, the most appropriate class is 'Similar'.
