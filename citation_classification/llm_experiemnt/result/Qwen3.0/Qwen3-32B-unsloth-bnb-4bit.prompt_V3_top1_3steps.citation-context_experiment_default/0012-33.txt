Okay, let's start by looking at the citation passage. The sentence with the citation mentions that the cited work established Kochâ€™s postulates for 'Candidatus Phytoplasma asteris' associated with aster yellows. The current work confirms similar findings but in different hosts. 

Step 1 is to extract the context around the citation. The key part is that the cited work established the postulates in specific hosts, and the current study does similar in different ones. 

Step 2: Determining the general intent. Here, the authors are pointing out that their findings align with those of the cited work, even in different hosts, which shows a similarity in results or observations.

Step 3: Comparing with rhetorical classes. The Similar class is for when the citation points out similarities between the cited work and the current paper, especially in terms of results or patterns. This fits because the current study's results confirm similar findings found in the cited work. So the label should be Similar.
