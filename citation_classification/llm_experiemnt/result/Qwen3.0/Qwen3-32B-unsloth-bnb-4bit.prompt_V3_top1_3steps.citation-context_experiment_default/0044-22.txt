Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the citation mentioned. The passage is talking about the application of a magnetic field on hard water. The sentence says, "Our previous research @@REFERENCE@@ has shown that...". So the context here is that the current work builds on their previous findings where applying a magnetic field prevented calcite scale formation. 

Next, identifying the general intent. Since the citation is referencing their own previous work to justify why the current research is being conducted, it seems like they're pointing to a gap or a need. The current study aims to explain the mechanism that the previous research didn't cover. That sounds like a Motivation because it's about justifying the current work based on prior findings that leave something unresolved.

Now, narrowing down to the specific rhetorical class. The example given for Motivation mentions citing previous work to identify a knowledge gap or to justify the current research's purpose. Here, the previous research showed a result but didn't provide an explanation, so the current work is trying to understand the mechanism. That fits the Motivation category as they're addressing an identified need for further investigation into the mechanism.

I should check if it's not Basis. Basis is about the intellectual foundation, but here it's more about justifying why this follow-up is needed. So it's Motivation. Also, no comparison is happening here, so not CoCoGM or CoCoRes. No criticism, so not Weakness. Definitely not Support or Similar either. Final answer should be Motivation.
