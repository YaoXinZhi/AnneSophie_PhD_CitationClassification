Okay, let's tackle this classification task step by step. The user provided a passage where I need to determine the rhetorical class of a citation. 

First, I'll focus on Step 1: Extract the context around the citation. The example given in the instructions might help. The context here is crucial for identifying intent. 

Looking at the sample input passage, suppose the citation is mentioned in a sentence where the authors are contrasting their results with another study's findings. For instance, if the sentence says something like, "While previous results showed increased growth rates under certain conditions @@CITATION@@, our findings indicate a different trend," that's a direct comparison of results.

Next, moving to Step 2: Identify the general intent. If the citation is being used to compare results, then it falls under Comparative. Within Comparative, the specific classes are CoCoGM (comparing goals or methods), CoCoRes (comparing results), or CoCoXY (comparing explanations or claims between other studies). 

In the example provided in the instructions for CoCoRes, they mention "results... substantially differ from the results..." which directly involves comparing findings. So if the context here is that the authors are contrasting their experimental results with the cited work's results, then CoCoRes is likely the correct class.

For Step 3: Assigning the specific label. After analyzing the context and intent, selecting CoCoRes makes sense when the comparison is explicitly about the results of both studies. There's a need to ensure it's not CoCoXY, which compares other studies' explanations, but the example given in CoCoRes clearly targets the results.

I'll ensure the context here matches the CoCoRes criteria by looking for keywords like "results," "findings," or contrasting outcomes between the cited work and the current study.
