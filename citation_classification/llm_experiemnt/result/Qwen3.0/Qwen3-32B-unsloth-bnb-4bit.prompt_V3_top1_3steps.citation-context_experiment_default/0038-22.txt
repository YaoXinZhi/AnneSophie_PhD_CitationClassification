Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. 

First, I need to extract the context around the @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. The passage provided is: “The pathogenic activity of *R. vitis* in grapevines results from the synthesis of phytotoxic substances, such as β-1,4-glucan and glycoprotein, and from parasitism on the host tissues, which was previously demonstrated by several workers (Zhang et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2021) @@CITATION@@.” 

The relevant part around the citation is the phrase “which was previously demonstrated by several workers (Zhang et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2021) @@CITATION@@.” The authors are referring to prior studies that had already shown the pathogenic activity mechanisms of *R. vitis*. 

Next, determining the general intent. Here, the authors are citing previous works to support their current statement about the mechanisms of pathogenicity. They’re not comparing methods, results, or goals with their own work. It's more about backing up their assertion with existing literature. That points towards a supportive intent.

Looking at the specific rhetorical classes, Support is used when the citation confirms the work, result, or finding of the citing authors. The example given under Support mentions consistency with previous research, which aligns here since Zhang and Wang's works are cited as prior demonstrations of what the authors are discussing. The mention isn’t about similarity beyond just supporting the claim made, so Support fits better than Similar here. Also, there’s no indication of criticism, comparison, motivation, or future work. 

Therefore, the most appropriate class is Support.
