Okay, let me work through this step by step. So, the task is to classify the citation in the given passage. The passage is: 

"Plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (hereafter referred to as PGPR) are known to have beneficial effects on the germination and growth of plants such as wheat, maize, and millet. The beneficial effects reported are mainly due to production of plant growth promoting phytohormones, nitrogen fixation, phosphate solubilization, siderophore production, and biocontrol properties (Lorou and Broughton, 1991; Glick et al., 1995; Glick, 1997; Bashan et al., 2008), and are also reviewed by @@CITATION@@ who described the role of PGPR on plant growth promotion."

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The surrounding context is "are also reviewed by @@CITATION@@ who described the role of PGPR on plant growth promotion." The authors being cited are providing a review on PGPR's role.

Next, identify the general intent. The paper is mentioning that various studies have reported beneficial effects of PGPR, and then it cites a review by another author. The cited work is describing the role of PGPR. The citing author is using this review to support the idea that PGPR's role has been reviewed, confirming or backing up the claims about PGPR's effects mentioned earlier.

Looking at the rhetorical classes, Support is when the citation is used to support or confirm the citing authors' work. In this case, the cited review is reinforcing that PGPR's benefits are well-documented, which the authors use to build their context. Since they're referencing a review that consolidates previous findings, it's acting as support for their discussion. There's no comparison, criticism, or future suggestion here, so it's likely Support. They aren't introducing their own new argument but are backing up their statement about PGPR effects with existing literature.
