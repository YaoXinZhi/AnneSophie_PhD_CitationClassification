Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user provided a passage from a scientific article with a citation tagged as @@CITATION@@. The task is to classify this citation into one of the predefined rhetorical classes.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage is: "However, conflicting results were also reported in relation to the response of plants inoculated with AM fungi and/or PGPR strains to water deficit conditions. In some cases, the results confirmed the beneficial effects of co-inoculation @@CITATION@@, whereas in other studies, no significant differences among the inoculated and non-inoculated controls were observed (Dakora & Philip-Hمرا, 1996; Vosátka et al., 2003)."

So the citation here is in the sentence where they say "the results confirmed the beneficial effects of co-inoculation @@CITATION@@", followed by mentioning other studies. The key part here is that the citation is being used to confirm the results reported in the citing paper—that co-inoculation had beneficial effects under water deficit conditions.

Next, determine the general intent. The citation is supporting the claim made in the previous sentence about confirming beneficial effects. The other part mentions conflicting results in other studies. But the primary intent here with the citation is to support the authors' statement by referencing a study that substantiates their findings.

Looking at the definitions, "Support" is when the citation is used to support, confirm the work or results of the citing authors. The example given is when they say, "All subscales were consistent with previous research, particularly that of @@CITATION@@", which aligns with this case.

Comparative classes like CoCoRes or CoCoGM don't fit here because the citation isn't comparing results or methods but rather serves as evidence. It's not foundational either since the authors aren't stating the citation as the basis of their work but rather supporting their specific claim with existing evidence. The mention of conflicting results in other studies is neutral but the citation here is specifically supporting their point. Therefore, the correct label is "Support".
