Okay, let's tackle this citation classification. The user provided a scientific passage with an @@CITATION@@ reference, and I need to assign the correct rhetorical class.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage says, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." The key part here is comparing the results of the current study with those from the cited work. 

Next, identify the intent. The phrase "substantially differ" indicates a comparison of outcomes between the two studies. According to the definitions, CoCoRes is for comparing results or findings. The example given in the CoCoRes class matches this scenario where results are directly contrasted. The citation isn't about methods or goals, nor is it supporting or criticizingâ€”it's a direct result comparison. 

So the most appropriate class here is CoCoRes.
