Okay, let's see. I need to classify the citation in the given passage. The task says to follow steps 1 to 3.

First, extract the context around the citation. The passage is: "Several studies have demonstrated that phytoplasma-infected plants often exhibit symptoms such as yellowing, phyllody, and witchesâ€™ broom @@CITATION@." 

So the context is that the citation is referencing studies that showed certain symptoms in phytoplasma-infected plants. The words used are "demonstrated" and "studies," which suggests that the cited work provides evidence or support for the current statement.

Next, identify the general intent. The citation is used to back up the claim that these symptoms are common in infected plants. That sounds like a Supportive intent because the authors are confirming their findings with previous research.

Now, looking at the specific classes, Support means the citation supports or confirms the work of the citing authors. The example given is when all subscales were consistent with previous research, which is similar here. The cited study here supports the current paper's assertion about symptoms.

So the rhetorical class should be Support.
