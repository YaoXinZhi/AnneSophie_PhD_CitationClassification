Okay, let's start by looking at the passage provided. The citation is mentioned in the context of comparing results between the current study and previous work.

The sentence says, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." 

The key here is the phrase "substantially differ," which indicates a direct comparison of results. The authors are contrasting their findings with those from the cited study. 

Looking at the definitions, CoCoRes is the class for comparing or contrasting results of the cited work with the citing paper. This matches the context perfectly. 

So the rhetorical class should be CoCoRes.
