Okay, let me tackle this step by step. First, I need to look at the citation's context in the given passage. The user wants me to extract the relevant part where the citation is used.

The example provided is: "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@."

Looking at this sentence, the citation is used to state a historical fact about when the use of these devices started spreading in the USA. There's no direct comparison to previous research, no support of the current findings, nor any criticism. The author is simply providing background information, a neutral statement about the history of magnetic water treatment usage. According to the definitions, a Neutral citation is when it's used in a neutral, descriptive way without supporting, comparing, or criticizing. 

So the rhetorical class here should be Neutral.
