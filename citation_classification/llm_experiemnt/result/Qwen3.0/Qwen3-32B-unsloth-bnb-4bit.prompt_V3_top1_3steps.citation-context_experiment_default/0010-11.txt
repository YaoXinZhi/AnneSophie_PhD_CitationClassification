Okay, let me see. The user provided a context where I need to classify a citation into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. The passage is about a study on a new method for detecting plant diseases using spectral analysis. The citation is mentioned in the sentence: "Recently, @@CITATION@@ developed a novel spectral analysis technique that improves the accuracy of disease detection in soybean crops. We adapted this approach for use in wheat plants as described in the methodology section."

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The key part is that the cited work developed a technique which the authors are adapting. The intent here seems to be referencing a prior method that they are building upon. 

Next, determining the general intent. Since they mention adapting the approach from the cited work, it's about using a method introduced by others. Looking at the classifications, "Usage" refers to when the cited method, tool, etc., is directly used in the current study. The example given under Usage is about an experimental setup described previously, which aligns with this case. Here, the technique from the citation is utilized, so the rhetorical class should be Usage.
