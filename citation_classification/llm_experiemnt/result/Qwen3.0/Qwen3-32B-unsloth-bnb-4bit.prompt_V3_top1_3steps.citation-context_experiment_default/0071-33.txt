Okay, let's tackle this classification problem step by step. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage provided is: “Several factors contributing to the spread of the pathogen include the high mobility of the vector and the presence of suitable host plants in the surrounding areas, as reported by @@CITATION@@.” Removing the citation tag, the context is about factors contributing to the pathogen's spread, mentioning high vector mobility and suitable host plants as reported by the cited work.

Next, identifying the general intent. Here, the authors are stating factors reported in previous work. The citation is used to support their own discussion by citing findings from another study. The context doesn't indicate criticism, comparison, motivation, future work, or any other specific argument beyond supporting their own discussion with prior findings.

Looking at the rhetorical classes, 'Support' fits when the citation is used to support the current work's claims. However, in the given example under 'Support', the subscales are consistent with previous research. In this case, the authors mention factors as reported by the cited work. It's a direct endorsement of prior findings as supporting elements of their discussion. 

Alternatively, 'Neutral' could be considered if the citation is just a factual reference without adding argumentative support. But the phrase "as reported by @@CITATION@@" suggests that the cited work's findings are being used to back up their own statements, aligning more with 'Support'. 

Therefore, the most appropriate class is 'Support'.
