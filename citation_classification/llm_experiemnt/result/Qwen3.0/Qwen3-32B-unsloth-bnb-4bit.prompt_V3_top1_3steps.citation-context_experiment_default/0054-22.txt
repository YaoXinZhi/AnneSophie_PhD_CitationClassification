Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the given citation. First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage is talking about the application of a specific method. The authors mention that they implemented and tested an algorithm introduced by @@CITATION@@. The key part here is that the cited work introduced the algorithm they are using.

So step one: The context is about implementing a previously introduced algorithm. Step two: The intent here seems to be foundational because they are building on the work of the cited authors. They reference the original source of the algorithm. The example for Basis mentions introducing and validating a method, which is similar here. 

Comparing to the classes, Basis is when the citation is the intellectual foundation. Since the cited work introduced the algorithm they're using, this fits Basis. It's not a comparison or support, because they're not contrasting results or methods, nor are they supporting their own findings with existing ones. It's more about the origin of the method they're employing. So the final class should be Basis.

Step 1: Extracted context: "...we implemented and tested an algorithm introduced by @@CITATION@@ for the purpose..."

Step 2: General intent: Foundational - the citation references the intellectual foundation (origin of the algorithm being implemented)

Step 3: Specific rhetorical class: Basis

Basis
