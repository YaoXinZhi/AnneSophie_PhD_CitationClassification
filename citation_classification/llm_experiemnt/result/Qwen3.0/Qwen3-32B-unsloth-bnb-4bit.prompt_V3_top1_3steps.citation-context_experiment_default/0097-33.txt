Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. First, I need to look at the provided passage and understand the context around the citation. The example passage mentions that the authors used the same detection method as in the cited work (references 10, 11, and 12). They compared their results with those cited studies.

So, the first step is extracting the relevant context. The key part here is "In agreement with reference 10, references 11 and 12 reported positive PCR results using the same detection strategy..." indicating a comparison of results between their study and those cited works because they found positive amplification of the same targets with the same method. 

Next, identifying the general intent. The citation is being used to compare the results obtained in the current study with previous studies, which aligns with CoCoRes since it's about comparing outcomes or findings (CoCoRes stands for Comparison of Results).

Finally, applying the specific label based on this comparison of results or findings. The example given under CoCoRes fits here since it's discussing how certain studies found positive PCR results using a particular detection strategy compared to their own findings with that strategy. Therefore, the correct label is CoCoRes.

Context: "In agreement with reference 10, references 11 and 12 reported positive PCR results... using the same detection strategy applied here."

General intent: Comparison of findings/results with previously published studies using identical methods.
