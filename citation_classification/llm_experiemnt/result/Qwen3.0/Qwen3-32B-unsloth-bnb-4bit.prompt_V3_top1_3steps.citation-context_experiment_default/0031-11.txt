Okay, let's see. I need to determine the rhetorical class for this citation. The passage is talking about some research on phytoplasma strains causing diseases in daisy plants. The citation here is mentioned as having described the association between strains causing BBOD in Brazil and the 16SrII-B genotype of the phytoplasma group 16SrII-A/B.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The citation is presented as something that described this association. The authors are contrasting that finding with another study which suggested different results for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima. So they're comparing two different studies' findings here.

Looking at the CoCo categories, CoCoXY involves comparing explanations or claims between cited studies rather than the citing paper with the cited one. Since the example given for CoCoXY contrasts two cited studies directly, that seems to fit here. The sentence mentions conflicting results between two studies, so the citation is part of a comparison between the BBOD study and another study in Euphorbia. 

So even though the current paper isn't being compared here, the citation is being used to compare two different studies' results. Therefore, the rhetorical class should be CoCoXY.
