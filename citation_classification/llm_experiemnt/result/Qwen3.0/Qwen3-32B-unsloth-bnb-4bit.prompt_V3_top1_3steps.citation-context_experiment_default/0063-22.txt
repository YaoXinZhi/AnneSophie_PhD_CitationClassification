Okay, let's try to figure out the rhetorical class for this citation. The passage given is:

"The most effective method of long-term control appears to be the use of cultivars resistant to the disease. @@CITATION@@ demonstrated that resistant cultivars reduce disease incidence in the field."

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The sentence is saying that resistant cultivars are effective for long-term control and then the citation is used to show that they demonstrated this reduction in disease incidence.

Next, the general intent. The author is referencing the cited work to support the claim that resistant cultivars work. They're not comparing methods or results with other studies, nor are they criticizing the cited work. It's more about confirming or backing up their own statement with previous research. So the intent seems supportive.

Looking at the classes, Support is when the citation supports the authors' work or confirms their findings. The example given for Support mentions that the subscales were consistent with previous research, which is similar hereâ€”the citation is supporting the assertion about resistant cultivars reducing disease.

Is there a chance it could be Basis? Basis is more about foundational work, like introducing a concept. Here, the citation is used to support a specific finding rather than establish the foundation. 

Could it be Similar? Similar is when the cited work and the current paper share similarities. The example talks about findings supporting each other, but here the citation is used to back up the claim rather than show similarity in results. 

No comparison is happening, so CoCo classes don't apply. No motivation or future work is mentioned. Usage refers to methods, which isn't the case here. No criticism either. 

So the best fit is Support. The cited work's demonstration supports the authors' claim about resistant cultivars being effective.
