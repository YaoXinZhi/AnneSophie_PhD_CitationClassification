Okay, let's tackle this classification problem step by step. First, I need to understand the given passage and the role of the citation denoted by CITSEG. The passage says, "However, a review of the available literature is rather confusing due to the often contradictory results that were reported. [REF1-REF12]." 

Looking at the rhetorical classes provided, the key here is that the citation is used to compare or contrast two cited studies with each other, not with the citing paper itself. The example under CoCoXY mentions a review of literature with contradictory results from cited references. In the example, the citation isn't being compared to the current work but is highlighting discrepancies between the cited studies.

In the given passage, the authors mention that the literature is confusing because of contradictory results from the cited works (REF1-REF12). They aren't comparing their own results or methods with the cited work but are pointing out contradictions among the cited studies. This directly aligns with the CoCoXY class, which is for comparing explanations or claims between cited studies. There's no mention of the current paper's results or methods here; it's purely about the cited works conflicting with each other. Therefore, the correct class should be CoCoXY.
