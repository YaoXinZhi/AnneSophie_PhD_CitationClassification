Okay, let's try to figure out the rhetorical class for this citation. The example given is from the "Usage" category. The citation says, "The experimental set-up was described in details previously (CITSEG)." Here, the authors are referring to a method or experimental setup from a previous study that they used in their own work. The key here is that they're directly using the setup described in CITSEG. 

Looking at the definitions, "Usage" is when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup used in the current study. The example matches this because they mention using the experimental setup from the cited work.

So, the task is to determine which class the given citation falls into. If the passage mentions using a method, tool, etc., from the cited work, then "Usage" is correct. If it's comparing results, then "CoCoRes," if it's supporting a claim, then "Support," and so on. I need to check the context around the CITSEG placeholder to see which category fits best.
