Okay, let's see. I need to classify the rhetorical function of the citation in the given example passage.

The example given is: "Similarly, a small aphid gut binding peptide was shown to interfere with enamovirus uptake from pea aphid gut into the hemocoel; the peptide also bound to gut epithelia of two other aphid species suggesting potential broader applicability (CITSEG)."

Looking at the context, the sentence says "Similarly..." which usually indicates that the current work is pointing out something that aligns with prior research. The citation here is supporting the claim by showing that a similar finding has been observed before. The phrase "was shown to interfere" followed by CITSEG suggests that the cited work found something similar, reinforcing the current paper's findings or implications. 

The key word here is "Similarly," which is part of the structure used to indicate a supportive example or a related finding. Since the citation is presented as evidence that supports or reinforces the current statement about broader applicability, the correct class should be Support. The cited work's findings align with the citing paper's claim, so Support is the appropriate label here.
