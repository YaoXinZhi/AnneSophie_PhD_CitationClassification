Okay, I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the CITSEG in this passage. Let me start by reading the example given for each class to understand how they work. The task is to assign the correct label from the list provided.

The citation to classify is in the following text: 
"The experimental set-up was described in details previously (CITSEG)."

Looking at the examples, the Usage class is for when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup used in the current study. The example given is almost identical: "The experimental set-up was described in details previously (CITSEG)." So this seems like a direct match. The citing authors are referring to the setup used in their own study being described in a previous paper, hence the CITSEG is for the experimental setup's origin. That fits the Usage class definition perfectly. There's no comparison, support, motivation, etc., hereâ€”just a reference to the setup's prior description. Therefore, the correct label is Usage.

{"label": "Usage"}
