Okay, let's tackle this citation classification problem. First, I need to look at the given passage and understand the context in which the citation (CITSEG) is used. Let me read through the example passage again.

The example for the 'Usage' class is: "The experimental set-up was described in details previously (CITSEG)." Here, the citation refers to the method or experimental setup used in the current study, which aligns with the 'Usage' label. 

Now, looking at the target passage provided by the user: "We modified the experimental protocol of (CITSEG) by adding an additional control group and adjusting the temperature parameters." The key part here is "modified the experimental protocol," which indicates that the cited work provided the original protocol that the authors are building upon by making changes. 

In the 'Usage' class examples, the citation is used to reference a method or tool directly used in the study. In this case, modifying the protocol implies that the original protocol was referenced and used as a basis, fitting the 'Usage' classification. 

Alternatively, if they were replicating it, it might fall under 'Basis', but modifying and adjusting parameters suggests a direct usage of their method as part of their own methodology, so 'Usage' seems appropriate.
