Okay, let's tackle this classification problem. So, the task is to determine the correct rhetorical class for the citation (CITSEG) in the given passage. The classes are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, and Weakness.

First, I need to look at the example passage. The example provided says: "However, a review of the available literature is rather confusing due to the often contradictory results that were reported. [REF1-REF12]". The correct class here is CoCoXY because the citation is used to compare the contrasting studies themselves, not relating the citing paper's own work but the cited studies with each other.

In the current case, the user hasn't provided the actual citation passage, but based on the format, I need to assume the content is similar to the example given. So the key aspects here are that the citation is pointing out a confusing situation in the literature due to contradictory results from different studies. The CoCoXY class is specifically for when the citation is comparing or contrasting the cited studies with each other, rather than comparing the citing paper's work with others.

I should check if there are any similarities with other classes. For instance, CoCoRes is about comparing results between the citing paper and the cited work, but in this scenario, the focus is on the cited works contradicting each other, not the citing paper's results. Similarly, CoCoGM deals with goals or methods comparisons. Since the example here is about contradictory results among the cited studies, CoCoXY fits best.

Therefore, without the actual passage but following the example's structure, the correct class would be CoCoXY.
