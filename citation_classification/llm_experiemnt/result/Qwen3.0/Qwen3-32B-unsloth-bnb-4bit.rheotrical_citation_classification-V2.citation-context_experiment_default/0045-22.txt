Okay, let's see. I need to classify the rhetorical class of the citation in the given passage. The citation is enclosed in (CITSEG).

The passage says: "...the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)."

Looking at the example for CoCoRes, which is when the citation compares results or findings between the current work and the cited paper. The example given is about differing results. Here, the passage mentions "the results obtained in the present work substantially differ..." comparing to the experiments from the cited work. In the user's example, they're contrasting their results with those from the cited study. 

So, in the given passage, the authors are stating that their results differ from the ones obtained in the study cited. That's a direct comparison of results. Therefore, this should fall under CoCoRes. Let me check if there's another class that might fit better. It's not about motivations, future work, or weaknesses. The comparison is between their experiment's results and the cited study's results, so CoCoRes is correct.
