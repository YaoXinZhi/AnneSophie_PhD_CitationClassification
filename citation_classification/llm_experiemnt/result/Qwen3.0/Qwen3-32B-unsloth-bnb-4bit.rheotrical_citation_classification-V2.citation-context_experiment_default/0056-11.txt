Okay, let's tackle this classification. The user provided a citation passage and a set of classes. I need to determine which class best fits how the citation is being used.

Looking at the example passage: "Similarly, a small aphid gut binding peptide was shown to interfere with enamovirus uptake from pea aphid gut into the hemocoel; the peptide also bound to gut epithelia of two other aphid species suggesting potential broader applicability (CITSEG)." 

The key phrase here is "suggesting potential broader applicability (CITSEG)." This seems to indicate that the cited study provides an example or evidence that supports the idea of broader applicability, which the authors of the citing paper are building upon. The word "similarly" suggests a comparison, but the main point is that the citation is used to support the claim about the peptide's applicability. However, the task is to classify based on rhetorical functions. 

Wait, the example given under the 'Future' class mentions a citation used to suggest directions for future research. But in this case, the citation isn't about future work; it's about a study that's being cited to show a related finding that implies broader applications. 

Looking at the 'Support' class example: "All subscales were consistent with previous research, particularly that of (CITSEG)...". Here, the citation supports their findings. In the given passage, the citation is used to show that their finding (about the peptide) is similar to another study's findings (also about aphid gut binding peptides), which supports the broader applicability claim. So this might be a 'Similar' case. 

Wait, the 'Similar' example is when pointing out similarity. The example passage starts with "Similarly," which is a direct indicator of similarity. The citation here is used to draw a parallel between their findings and the cited work's findings. Therefore, this would fall under the 'Similar' class. 

So the correct classification is 'Similar'.
