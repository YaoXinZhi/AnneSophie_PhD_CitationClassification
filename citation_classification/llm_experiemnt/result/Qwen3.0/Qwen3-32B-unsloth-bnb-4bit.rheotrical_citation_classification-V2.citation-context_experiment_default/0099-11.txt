Okay, let's see. I need to classify the citation in the given passage according to the rhetorical classes provided. The passage is: "However, a review of the available literature is rather confusing due to the often contradictory results that were reported. (CITSEG)." 

First, I need to understand what the citation is being used for here. The sentence starts with "However, a review...", which suggests there's an issue the authors are pointing out. The main point is that the literature is confusing because of contradictory results. The citation is mentioned as one of the sources. 

Looking at the classes, CoCoXY is described as comparing two cited studies with each other, not the citing paper itself. The example given is about contradictory results leading to confusion in literature. The current passage seems to indicate that different studies have conflicting results, which makes the literature confusing. This scenario where cited works contradict each other fits under CoCoXY according to the instructions. 

The class 'Basis' is when the cited work is foundational for the current research. 'Motivation' relates to justifying the study's necessity due to gaps. 'Neutral' is for descriptions without specific argumentation. 'Support' is when the citation supports the authors' claims. 'CoCoRes' compares results between their work and the citing paper, but here the paper's own findings aren't compared with the cited works. 

Here, it's about contrasting different cited studies with each other, leading to confusion, so CoCoXY is the correct class.
