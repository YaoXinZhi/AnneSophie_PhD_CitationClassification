Okay, let's see. The task is to classify the citation in the given passage using the predefined rhetorical classes. First, I need to read the passage carefully to understand the context of the citation.

Looking at the example provided, the user gave a sample passage where the citation is used to support a claim. The example says that the results differ, so the class is CoCoRes. Let me compare that with the current passage.

In the current passage: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)." The structure here is similar to the CoCoRes example provided. The authors are comparing their results with those from the cited study, stating that there's a substantial difference. 

I need to check if this falls under CoCoRes, which is about comparing results. There's no mention of contrasting methods or goals here, which would be CoCoGM. Also, there's no comparison between two cited studies as in CoCoXY. The citation is used to contrast findings directly with the current work, so CoCoRes seems right. 

Other classes like Support or Basis don't fit because the authors aren't using the citation to support their own findings but to highlight a difference. Motivation and Future are also out of context here. 

So the correct classification should be CoCoRes.
