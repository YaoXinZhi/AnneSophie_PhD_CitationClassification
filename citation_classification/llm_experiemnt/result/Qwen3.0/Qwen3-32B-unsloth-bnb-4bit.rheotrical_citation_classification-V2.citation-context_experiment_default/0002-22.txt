Okay, let me try to figure this out. The task is to classify the citation here based on the given classes. Let me read through the citation passage again carefully.

The passage says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)." 

Hmm, so they're talking about their own results differing from another study's results. The key words here are "substantially differ from the results of the experiments." When I look at the classes, CoCoRes is for comparing results. The example given under CoCoRes is similar: comparing their results with another study's. The citation here is directly contrasting their findings with the cited work's findings. So I think this should be CoCoRes.

Let me double-check the other classes. Basis is about foundation for their research, which doesn't fit. Motivation would be about why they did the research, which isn't the case here. Support would be if they're backing up their claims with the cited work, but here they're showing a difference. So CoCoRes makes sense. Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's CoCoRes.
