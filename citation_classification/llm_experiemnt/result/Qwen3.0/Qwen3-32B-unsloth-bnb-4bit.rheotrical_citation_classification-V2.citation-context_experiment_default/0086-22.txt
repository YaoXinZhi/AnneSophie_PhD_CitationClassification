Okay, let's tackle this classification task step by step. The user provided a scientific article passage and wants me to determine the rhetorical class of the citation denoted by CITSEG. The classes range from Basis to Weakness, each with specific criteria.

First, I need to understand the passage. Let's read it carefully. The example given is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)." 

Looking at the CoCoRes example, it mentions comparing results of cited work with the citing paper. The key phrase here is "substantially differ," which indicates a direct comparison of results between the current study and the cited work. The purpose is to highlight differences, which falls under CoCoRes. 

I should check if the citation is used to contrast findings. The passage doesn't discuss methods or goals, nor does it provide support or motivation. It's purely about differing results. The Neutral class doesn't fit because the citation is directly contrasted here. Similarly, Basis would involve foundational work, which isn't the case. Therefore, CoCoRes is the correct class.
