Okay, let's see. I need to figure out which rhetorical class the citation falls into here. The passage says: "The experimental set-up was described in details previously (CITSEG)." 

Hmm, the key part here is "described in details previously." The authors are referring to where the experimental setup was detailed before. So they're citing a previous work that they used for their current study's setup.

Looking at the classes, there's one called Usage. The example given is about an experimental set-up being described in a previous paper. That matches exactly. The Usage class is when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup used in the current study. 

So this CITSEG is being used because they're directly referencing the setup from that previous study. It's not for comparison, support, or motivation. It's just to point out where the setup was originally described. Therefore, the correct class should be Usage.
