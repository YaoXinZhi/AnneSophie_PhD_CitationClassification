Okay, let me tackle this classification step by step. First, I need to understand the passage where the citation is located. Let me read through the example provided in the prompt again to get a sense.

The example given under the 'CoCoXY' class is: "However, a review of the available literature is rather confusing due to the often contradictory results that were reported. [REF1-REF12]". Here, the citation isn't comparing the current study to the cited works but is instead pointing out contradictions among the cited studies themselves. 

Now, looking at the actual citation passage provided in the user's example: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)."

The key phrase here is "substantially differ from the results of the experiments...". This is directly comparing the results of their present work with those from the cited experiments. According to the classes provided, 'CoCoRes' is for comparing or contrasting results or findings between the citing paper and the cited work. Since the citation here is about differing results, this should fall under CoCoRes.

Wait, but the user wants me to analyze their example under the CoCoXY class. Wait, no, the user provided an example under CoCoXY where the comparison is between cited studies, not between the citing paper and cited work. So in their example, the confusion comes from contradictory results among the cited works. In the user's actual example, they are comparing their own results (present work) to the cited results. Therefore, according to the classes given, 'CoCoRes' is the right category here because it's comparing results between their study and the cited work. The example given under 'CoCoRes' also matches this scenario: comparing the results of the present work with those of the cited experiments. 

So the correct classification here is CoCoRes.
