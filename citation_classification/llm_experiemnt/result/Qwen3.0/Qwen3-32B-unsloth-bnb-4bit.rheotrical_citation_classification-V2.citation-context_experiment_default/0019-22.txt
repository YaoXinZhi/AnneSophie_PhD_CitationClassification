Alright, let's tackle this citation classification step by step. The task is to determine the rhetorical class of the citation denoted by (CITSEG) in the given passage. First, I need to understand the context around the citation.

Looking at the passage: "In this study, we employed the methodology outlined in (CITSEG)..." The key part here is "employed the methodology". The authors are directly referencing a method from the cited work. 

Now, comparing this to the list of rhetorical classes provided. The "Usage" class is defined as referring to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup from the cited work that is directly used in the current study. The example given for "Usage" mentions an experimental setup described in a previous study, which aligns closely with the current passage's mention of using methodology from (CITSEG).

The other classes don't fit as well. "Basis" is about intellectual foundation or continuation, which isn't the case here. "CoCoGM" involves comparing goals or methods, which isn't happening hereâ€”they are using the method, not comparing. Similarly, "Support", "Motivation", etc., don't apply. Therefore, "Usage" is the correct classification here.
