Okay, let's tackle this citation classification task. First, I need to figure out which rhetorical class fits the given example. The example provided is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)."

The classes include Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, Weakness. 

Looking at the example sentence, the key phrase is "substantially differ from the results of the experiments..." So the authors are comparing their results with those of the cited work. The purpose here is to highlight a contrast in results, which points towards the CoCoRes class. 

CoCoRes is defined as comparing or contrasting results or findings. That fits perfectly here since the sentence is about differing results. It's not about methods or goals (CoCoGM) nor explanations or claims between studies (CoCoXY). The cited work's results are being compared directly with the current study's results. 

Neutral would be if it's just stated without comparison. Motivation is about why the research is done, which isn't the case here. Support would be if the cited results back up the current claims, but here they're contrasting. So CoCoRes is definitely the right choice here.
