Okay, let's tackle this classification task step by step. The passage provided is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) [1]." I need to determine the rhetorical class for the citation [1] here.

First, I'll look at the context around the citation. The key phrase is "substantially differ from the results of the experiments." The author is comparing their findings with those from the cited work. The CoCoRes class is for comparing results directly. Let me check the example given for CoCoRes: it mentions differing results from experiments, which matches the structure here. The Basis class is about foundational work, which doesn't fit here since the cited work is being contrasted, not built upon. The Neutral class is for passive mentions without argumentation, but here there's a direct comparison. So CoCoRes seems right here.
