Okay, let me look at this citation classification task. The user wants me to determine the rhetorical class of the (CITSEG) placeholder in a given scientific passage. Let's start by reading the example passage they provided to understand the context.

In the example under CoCoXY, the citation is used to compare two cited studies with each other, not with the citing paper. The example passage mentions a confusing literature review with contradictory results from multiple references (REF1-REF12). The key here is that the citation is pointing out contradictions between the cited studies themselves, rather than contrasting them with the current paper's work. 

So the task is to determine which class label fits best for each instance of CITSEG based on how the cited work is being referenced. The classes range from Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, Weakness. 

Now, looking at the guidelines, CoCoXY is specifically when comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies, not involving the citing paper. If the example given under CoCoXY talks about conflicting results among the cited works, then any similar scenario in a passage pointing out contradictions or differences between studies would fall under CoCoXY.

In the example provided by the user under CoCoXY: "However, a review of the available literature is rather confusing due to the often contradictory results that were reported. [REF1-REF12]", the CITSEG refers to multiple studies whose results contradict each other. The citing paper is highlighting that these cited works don't agree with each other, so this is a CoCoXY classification.

If the task is to label each CITSEG in a passage based on the context given, I need to identify the function. For the example given in the CoCoXY class description, the correct label is CoCoXY because the citation is used to compare different studies' explanations or claims. 

Therefore, in the passage provided, when the citation is used to show conflicting results among other cited works, the correct rhetorical class would be CoCoXY.
