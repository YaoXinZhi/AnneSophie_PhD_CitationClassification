Okay, let's look at the passage provided. The sentence is "The experimental set-up was described in details previously (CITSEG)." So the citation here is referring to a previous work where the experimental setup was detailed.

Now, checking the rhetorical classes. The Usage class is for when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup used directly in the current study. This example matches exactly because the authors are saying they used the experimental setup described in the cited work.

So the correct label here should be Usage.
