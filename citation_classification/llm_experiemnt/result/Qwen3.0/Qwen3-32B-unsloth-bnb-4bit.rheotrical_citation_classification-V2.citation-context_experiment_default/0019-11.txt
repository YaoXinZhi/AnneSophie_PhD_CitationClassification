Okay, let's see what the task is here. I need to classify how a citation is used in a scientific article. The user provided several examples and categories. First, I should understand each category carefully to make sure I don't mix them up.

The categories include Basis, which is when the cited work is foundational for the current research. Then there's CoCoGM for comparing goals or methods, CoCoRes for comparing results, CoCoXY for comparing explanations between cited studies, Future for suggesting directions, Motivation for justifying the research, Neutral for neutral mentions, Similar for similarities, Support for backing up claims, Usage for methods used, and Weakness for criticizing the work.

Looking at the example provided for each category helps. For instance, Basis includes replication of previous work, CoCoGM says their work is complementary, etc. 

Now, the input passage is: "The experimental set-up was described in details previously (CITSEG)." 

Hmm, this seems to fit the Usage category. The citation is referring to a method or experimental setup used in the current study, right? The definition for Usage mentions referring to a method, tool, dataset, etc., from the cited work that's directly used here. 

I should check other categories to see if any might overlap. For example, Basis is about foundational work, but here it's about the experimental setup being used, not the intellectual basis. Support would require that the cited work supports a claim, but in this case, it's about the setup description. Neutral is for neutral mentions, but Usage is more precise here because it's about using a part of the cited work (experimental setup) in the current study.

So the correct class should be Usage.
