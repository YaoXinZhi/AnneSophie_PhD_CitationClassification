Okay, let me try to figure out the rhetorical class for this citation. The passage says, "The results obtained in the present work ... differ from the ... experiments conducted with deuterium saturated metal targets (CITSEG)." So the authors are comparing their results to those from another study. Looking at the classes, CoCoRes is for comparing results. The example given for CoCoRes mentions differing results, which matches here. The citation here is used to contrast their findings with the cited work's results. So it's definitely CoCoRes.
