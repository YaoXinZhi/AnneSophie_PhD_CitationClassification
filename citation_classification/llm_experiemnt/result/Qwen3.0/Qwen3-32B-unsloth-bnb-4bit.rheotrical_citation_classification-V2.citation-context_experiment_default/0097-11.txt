Okay, let's tackle this citation classification problem. First, I need to understand the given passage and determine the correct rhetorical class for the cited work denoted by (CITSEG). 

The passage provided is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)."

Looking at the rhetorical classes, the key here is comparing the results. The sentence structure states that the present work's results "substantially differ" from those of the cited experiments. This direct comparison of outcomes points towards the CoCoRes class, which is used when contrasting or comparing results between the citing paper and the cited work. The example given under CoCoRes also involves a comparison of experimental results, which aligns with this case. No other classes like Basis or Support seem fitting here since there's no indication of foundational use or supportive evidence, but rather a direct result contrast.
