Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify this citation. The user provided a citation and wants me to determine its rhetorical class based on the given categories. Let me look back at the examples and definitions for each class. 

The passage where the citation is used says something like "However, the results of (CITSEG) showed no significant effect..." So the author is mentioning the results of the cited work to contrast with their own findings or to show that they differ. 

Looking at the classes, CoCoRes is used when comparing results with the citing paper's results. The example given for CoCoRes mentions differing results from cited experiments. Another example might be where the authors talk about their results versus what others found.

On the other hand, if the citation was being used to establish prior knowledge that their current work builds on, it would be Basis. But here, the author is pointing out that their own work contradicts or differs from the cited results, so Comparison of Results seems more likely. 

I need to make sure it's not CoCoGM. CoCoGM is about comparing goals or methods, not results. Since the example cited here refers to the results explicitly, CoCoRes fits better. 

I think the correct classification here is CoCoRes.
