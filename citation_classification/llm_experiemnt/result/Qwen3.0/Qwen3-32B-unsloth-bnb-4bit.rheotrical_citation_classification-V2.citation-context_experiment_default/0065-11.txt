Okay, let me walk through my reasoning here. I need to classify the citation in the given passage into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. Let me look at the example passage again.

The passage says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)." 

So the citation here is being used to compare results. The key phrase is "substantially differ from the results of..." which indicates that the cited work's results are being contrasted with the current study's findings. According to the classes provided, CoCoRes is for comparing or contrasting results. 

Let me double-check the other classes to make sure I'm not missing something. The Basis class is for foundational work, which doesn't fit here since it's about differing results, not building on prior work. CoCoGM is about goals or methods comparison, but here it's the results that are compared. CoCoXY compares cited studies with each other, which isn't the case here. Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, and Weakness also don't apply. 

Therefore, CoCoRes is the correct classification here.
