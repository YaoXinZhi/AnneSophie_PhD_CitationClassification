Okay, let's tackle this. The user provided a citation (CITSEG) in a plant health context and wants me to classify its rhetorical function based on the given classes. 

First, I need to understand the surrounding text. Let's see the example given in the prompt. The passage says, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)." 

The key here is the phrase "substantially differ from the results of the experiments..." This directly points to comparing results. According to the classes, CoCoRes is for comparing or contrasting results. The example for CoCoRes matches this scenario exactly. They mention differing results and reference the cited work for those results.

I should check if there's any other possible class. It's not a Basis since the cited work isn't the foundation. Not CoCoGM because it's about results, not goals/methods. Not CoCoXY since it's between the citing paper and cited work, not two cited studies. Future or Motivation don't fit here. Neutral is incorrect because the citation is being used in a comparative context. Similar would be if they were aligning results, but here it's about differences. Support would be if they're affirming something, which isn't the case. Usage or Weakness also don't apply.

Therefore, CoCoRes is the correct classification.
