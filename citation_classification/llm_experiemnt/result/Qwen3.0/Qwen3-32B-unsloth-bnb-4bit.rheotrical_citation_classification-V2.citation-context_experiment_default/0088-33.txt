Okay, let's tackle this classification task step by step. The user provided a citation passage and wants me to assign the correct rhetorical class from the predefined list. First, I need to carefully read the example passage to understand the context in which the citation is used.

Looking at the example passage: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)." The key here is the phrase "substantially differ from," which indicates a comparison between the current study's results and those of the cited work. 

Next, I'll refer back to the list of rhetorical classes. The CoCoRes class is specifically for comparing or contrasting results or findings of the cited work with the citing paper. The example given under CoCoRes is almost identical in structure, mentioning differences in results. 

I need to ensure that this isn't a Basis or Support class. Basis would be if the cited work is the foundation for the current research, but here it's about differing results. Support would involve the cited work backing up the current claims, which isn't the case here. The citation here is highlighting a contrast, not supporting or basing the current work on the cited study. 

Also, checking other classes like CoCoGM (which is about goals or methods) or CoCoXY (comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies) don't fit because the comparison here is between the current study's results and the cited work's results. Therefore, CoCoRes is the most appropriate class here.
