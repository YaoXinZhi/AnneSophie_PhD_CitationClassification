Okay, let me try to figure out the correct class for this citation.

The passage says, "However, a review of the available literature is rather confusing due to the often contradictory results that were reported. (CITSEG)." 

Looking at the example for CoCoXY, it's about comparing two cited studies with each other. Here, the citation isn't comparing the citing paper's work but pointing out contradictions in different studies. The CITSEG is part of the literature that has contradictory results, so the authors are contrasting different cited works. 

I think CoCoXY is the right class here because they're highlighting conflicting explanations or claims among the cited references.
