Okay, let's tackle this citation classification step by step. The user wants me to determine which rhetorical class fits the citation in the given example.

First, I'll look at the example provided. The sentence says, "However, a review of the available literature is rather confusing due to the often contradictory results that were reported. [REF1-REF12]." The task is to classify the citation here. The options include CoCoXY, which is when comparing two cited studies with each other, not the citing paper. 

The key here is that the citation is listing multiple references (REF1-REF12) to indicate that the results are contradictory. The author isn't comparing their own work with these studies or supporting their argument but is instead pointing out inconsistencies among the cited works themselves. That fits CoCoXY perfectly since it's about contrasting different cited studies. None of the other classes like CoCoRes or Support seem right here. So the correct label should be CoCoXY.
