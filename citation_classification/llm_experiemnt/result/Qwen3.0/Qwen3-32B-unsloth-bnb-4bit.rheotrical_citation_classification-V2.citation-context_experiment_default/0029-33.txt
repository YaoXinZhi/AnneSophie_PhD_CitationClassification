Okay, let's tackle this citation classification. I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the given citation in the passage. Let's look at the example provided in the query. 

The example says: "However, a review of the available literature is rather confusing due to the often contradictory results that were reported. [REF1-REF12]"

First, I note that the citation here refers to multiple references (REF1-REF12) and the context is about the confusing state of existing literature because of contradictory results. The authors aren't comparing their own results with these studies nor are they motivating their own research based on them. Instead, they're pointing out discrepancies between the cited studies themselves. 

Looking at the classes, the CoCoXY class is defined for comparing or contrasting two cited studies with each other, not with the citing paper. The other classes don't fit hereâ€”like CoCoRes would involve comparing results with the citing paper, which isn't the case here. Basis, Future, Motivation, etc., don't apply because the authors aren't building upon the cited work, suggesting future research, or justifying their current study.

So the correct class here is CoCoXY because the citation is about the contrasting results among the cited studies themselves, as mentioned in the example. The key giveaway is the mention of confusion due to contradictory results in the cited literature.
