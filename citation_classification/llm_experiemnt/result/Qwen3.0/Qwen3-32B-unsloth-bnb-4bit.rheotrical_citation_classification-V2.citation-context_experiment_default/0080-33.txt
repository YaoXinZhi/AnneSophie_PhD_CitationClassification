Okay, let's start by looking at the citation passage provided.

The passage says: "All subscales were consistent with previous research, particularly that of (CITSEG) also using a U.S. sample; as before, participants did not distinguish between personal interests and values as reasons for disputes, nor between competence and methods."

Here, the authors mention that their results align with previous research by CITSEG. They specifically note consistency with CITSEG's findings, pointing out that participants didn't differentiate certain categories as before. 

Looking at the rhetorical classes, the "Support" class is used when a citation backs up a claim or finding. Since the authors are using CITSEG's work to reinforce their own results by showing consistency, this fits the Support category. There's a clear alignment indicated here, not just a neutral mention or a comparison. Theyâ€™re highlighting agreement with prior work, which is exactly what "Support" entails.
