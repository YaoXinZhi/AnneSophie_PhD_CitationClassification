Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in the given passage. The class options are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, Weakness.

First, I'll look at the example provided. The citation is used in the sentence: "Our work is complementary, as we focus instead on rigorously demonstrating human-like biases in word embeddings." The previous example under CoCoGM mentions comparing methods, and this example contrasts the cited work's method with theirs. The user points out that CoCoGM is when comparing goals or methods.

In the given passage, the wording "Most closely related to this paper is concurrent work by (CITSEG) who propose a method to 'debias' word embeddings. Our work is complementary, as we focus instead on..." seems to compare methods between the cited work and the current one. The cited work proposed a method to debias, and the authors are saying their focus is different but complementary. That sounds like comparing goals or methods (CoCoGM) according to the examples given.

I don't think it's CoCoRes because that's comparing results, not methods. The Basis class is when the cited work is the foundation, but here they're contrasting methods. Motivation or Future don't fit because there's no mentioning of why the research is needed or future directions. Support isn't right because they're not supporting their claims with the citation. Neutral is incorrect because it's actively comparing. Therefore, it's most likely CoCoGM.
