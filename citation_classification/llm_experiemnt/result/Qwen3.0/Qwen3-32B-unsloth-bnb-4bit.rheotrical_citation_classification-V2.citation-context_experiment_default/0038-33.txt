Okay, I need to figure out the correct rhetorical class for the given citation example. Let me start by reading the example carefully.

The citation is in the sentence: "The experimental set-up was described in details previously (CITSEG)." 

Looking at the classes provided, the Usage class is for when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup used in the study. The example given for Usage says something like referring to an experimental setup from the cited work. 

In this case, the authors are mentioning that their experimental setup was described previously in the cited source. That directly matches the Usage class because they're pointing to the setup they used, which was outlined in the CITSEG paper. 

I should check if any other classes might fit. The Neutral class is for citations used neutrally without supporting or comparing, but here it's specifically about using a setup from the cited work. Basis is about foundational work, but this isn't stating that CITSEG is the basis of their research, just that they used a setup from it. CoCo classes involve comparisons, which aren't present here. Future, Motivation, Similar, Support also don't apply. Weakness is about criticism, which isn't happening here. 

So definitely, the correct class is Usage.
