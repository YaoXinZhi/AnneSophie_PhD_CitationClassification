Okay, I need to classify the citation in the given passage into the correct rhetorical class. Let's read the example citation again carefully.

The example provided for the "CoCoXY" class is: "However, a review of the available literature is rather confusing due to the often contradictory results that were reported. [REF1-REF12]". In this case, the citations REF1-REF12 are used because the cited studies contradict each other, and the current paper is pointing out the contradiction between them without comparing to its own work. 

Now looking at the passage: "However, a review of the available literature is rather confusing due to the often contradictory results that were reported. [REF1-REF12]".

The key part here is "due to the often contradictory results that were reported." This indicates that the cited works have conflicting results. The passage doesn't mention comparing these results to the claiming paper's own results; instead, it highlights contradictions among the cited references. 

Let's check each class definition:
- **CoCoXY**: For comparing or contrasting explanations or claims among cited studies themselves (not with the citing paper).
- **CoCoRes**: Comparing results of cited work with the citing paper.
This fits CoCoXY since the citing paper discusses contradictions within the cited references, not comparing them to its own findings. 

Hence, the correct class label here is CoCoXY.
