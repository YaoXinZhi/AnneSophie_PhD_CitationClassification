Okay, let's tackle this classification. The user provided a citation in a scientific article passage and I need to determine its rhetorical class from the given options. 

First, I'll read the example passage again to understand the context. The example given is under the 'CoCoRes' class: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)." Here, the citation is comparing results of their study with another's. 

Now, looking at the user's input citation passage, I need to see how the cited work is being referenced. The task is to check if the citation is used to compare results, methods, goals, explanations, or for another rhetorical purpose.

In the given example under CoCoRes, the key phrase is "substantially differ from the results of...", which directly indicates a comparison of results between the current work and the cited study. The citation is there to highlight a contrast in findings. 

If the user's passage uses similar language, like comparing outcomes or findings with another study, then CoCoRes would be appropriate. I should look for verbs or phrases that indicate comparison, such as "differ", "compare", "contrast", "similar to", etc. 

Also, check if the citation is supporting a claim (Support class), which would involve phrases like "as shown by..." or "as confirmed by...". But in the example, it's not support because it's contrasting rather than reinforcing.

Another possibility is 'Basis', but that's when the cited work is foundational to the current research. Since the example is contrasting results, Basis doesn't fit. 'CoCoGM' relates to goals or methods, which isn't the case here. 

'CoCoXY' compares cited studies with each other, not with the current paper. The example passage is comparing the current results with the cited one, so CoCoRes is correct. 

Therefore, the correct class is CoCoRes.
