Okay, let me go through this step by step. The task is to classify the citation in the given passage into one of the specified rhetorical classes. The citation in question is labeled (CITSEG), and the sentence around it needs to be analyzed.

First, I'll read the example provided for each class to understand their definitions better. The classes include Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, and Weakness.

Looking at the example passage again: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)." 

The key phrase here is "substantially differ from the results... (CITSEG)." This is comparing the results of the current work with those of the cited study. According to the definitions, CoCoRes is for comparing results or findings between the citing paper and the cited work. The example given under CoCoRes matches this scenario where the present results are contrasted with previous ones. The cited work's results are directly compared here, which fits the CoCoRes class. 

Additionally, the mention of "substantially differ" indicates a direct comparison of outcomes rather than methods or motivations, ruling out CoCoGM. There doesn't seem to be any mention of future directions or weaknesses, so Future or Weakness aren't applicable. The Neutral class is for passive mentions without arguments, which isn't the case here. Support would be if the cited work reinforced the current findings, but here it's a contrast. Basis refers to foundational work, which isn't indicated here. Therefore, CoCoRes is the appropriate class.
