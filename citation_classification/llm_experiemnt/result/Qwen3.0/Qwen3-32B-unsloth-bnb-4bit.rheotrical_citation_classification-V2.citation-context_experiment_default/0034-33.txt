Okay, let's take a look at the citation example provided. The passage says, "Similarly, a small aphid gut binding peptide was shown to interfere with enamovirus uptake from pea aphid gut into the hemocoel; the peptide also bound to gut epithelia of two other aphid species suggesting potential broader applicability (CITSEG)." 

First, I need to figure out the rhetorical role of the citation here. The word "similarly" is a clue because it often introduces something that supports the current discussion. The authors are mentioning another study that found a peptide affecting virus uptake, and they're pointing out that this peptide has broader applicability beyond the initial case. 

Looking at the classes, "Support" is used when a citation backs up a claim or finding. Here, the cited work is used to support the idea that the peptide's effect might be applicable more broadly. The authors aren't just stating the existence of the peptide; they're using the citation to reinforce their own suggestion about its broader application.

Another possible class could be "Future," but I think "Future" is when the citation points out what needs more research. However, in this case, the citation is used to support an existing claim about potential broader use, so it's more about reinforcing their argument rather than indicating a future direction. 

Therefore, the correct class should be Support.
