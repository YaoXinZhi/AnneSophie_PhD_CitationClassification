Okay, let's tackle this citation classification task step by step. The user provided a citation passage and wants me to assign the correct rhetorical class from the given list. First, I need to read the example passage carefully.

The passage says, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)." 

Looking at the rhetorical classes, the key part here is "substantially differ from the results of the experiments." This is a direct comparison between the current study's results and those from the cited work. The CoCoRes class is specifically for comparing or contrasting results or findings. The example given under CoCoRes mentions comparing results, which matches the structure here. The cited work's results are being contrasted with the present work's results. There's no mention of methods, goals, or explanations, so CoCoGM or CoCoXY don't fit. It's not about future work, motivation, support, etc. Therefore, the correct class should be CoCoRes.
