Okay, let's see. The task is to determine the rhetorical class of the citation in the given passage. The user provided examples for each class, so I need to match the example to the correct label.

Looking at the example under the "CoCoRes" class: The example states that the results in the current work differ from those in the cited work. The citation is used to compare results directly. So in the passage provided, if the authors are contrasting their findings with those of the cited study, it would fall under CoCoRes.

Now, looking at the passage given: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)." The key phrase here is "substantially differ from the results," which indicates a direct comparison of results between the current study and the cited work. This aligns exactly with the CoCoRes class definition, which is for comparing or contrasting results or findings. 

Therefore, the correct classification here should be CoCoRes.
