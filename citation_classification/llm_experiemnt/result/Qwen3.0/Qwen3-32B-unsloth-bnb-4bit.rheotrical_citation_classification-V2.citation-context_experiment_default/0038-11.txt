Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. The task is to determine the rhetorical class of the citation (CITSEG) in the given passage. First, I need to understand the context of where the citation is being used.

The passage says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)." 

Looking at this sentence, the authors are comparing their own results with those from a previous study. The key phrase here is "substantially differ from the results... (CITSEG)." This comparison is about contrasting findings between two studies. 

Now, referring back to the rhetorical classes, the CoCoRes class is specifically for when the citation is used to compare or contrast the results or findings of the cited work with the current paper's results. 

The example given under CoCoRes is almost identical in structure to the sentence in question, which reinforces that this is the right fit. The authors aren't just mentioning the study neutrally or building on it; they're pointing out a difference in results. 

Other classes like Basis, Motivation, or Support don't fit because the citation isn't being used to argue for a foundation, justify the research, or support their own claims. There's no indication of future directions, similarity, or a comparison of methods/goals. Neutral doesn't work here because the authors are actively contrasting findings. The Weakness class might need further consideration if the citation was criticizing the prior study's results, but here it's more about difference rather than pointing out flaws.

Therefore, CoCoRes is the appropriate classification for this citation.
