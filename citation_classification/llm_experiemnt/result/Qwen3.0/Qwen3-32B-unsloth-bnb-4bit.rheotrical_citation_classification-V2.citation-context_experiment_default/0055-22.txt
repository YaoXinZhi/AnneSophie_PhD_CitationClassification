Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. The task is to figure out which rhetorical class the citation belongs to based on the given examples and definitions.

First, I need to understand the context where the citation is used. Looking at the example provided under the 'CoCoXY' category: "However, a review of the available literature is rather confusing due to the often contradictory results that were reported. [REF1-REF12]". Here, the cited works are being compared to each other, highlighting contradictions between studies. 

Now, applying this to the sentence provided: "However, a review of the available literature is rather confusing due to the often contradictory results that were reported. [REF1-REF12]". The key phrase is "contradictory results", which indicates that different studies are conflicting. The citation here isn't comparing the current research with the cited works, nor is it supporting the current findings. Instead, it's pointing out discrepancies between multiple sources. 

Looking at the list of classes, CoCoXY is for comparing cited studies with each other, not with the citing paper. This fits because the sentence is discussing confusion caused by contradictory results among multiple existing studies. The author isn't relating the cited works to their own research but is instead highlighting inconsistencies in the existing literature. 

I'll cross-verify with other classes to ensure accuracy. 'Basis' and 'Support' relate to foundational work or supporting current claims, which isn't the case here. 'CoCoGM' and 'CoCoRes' involve comparing goals/methods or results with the current paper, which isn't happening here. 'Neutral' is for descriptive citations without argumentative role. The given example definitely has an argumentative role (pointing out contradictions), so 'CoCoXY' is the correct label.
