Okay, let's see. I need to classify the citation in the given passage according to the rhetorical classes provided. The passage is about a classification based solely on morphological characters as indicated in the cited work (CITSEG). The user wants me to determine which class label applies here.

First, looking at the classes again. The options are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, Weakness. 

The passage says the classification is "based solely on morphological characters as indicated in the cited work (CITSEG)." The phrase "based solely on" suggests that the cited work is the foundation for their classification. That sounds like the Basis class because the current research is building upon or using the cited work as its intellectual foundation. 

Let me check the Basis example again. In the example, the cited work introduced and validated something, and the current work replicates their results. Here, the classification is directly based on morphological characters from CITSEG, which seems to be the foundation. 

Is there another possible class? Maybe Support if they are using it to back up their claim, but in Support, the citation is used to confirm their own findings. Here, it's more that they're using the classification method from CITSEG as their basis. 

Also, Neutral would be if it's just a neutral reference, but the wording here clearly indicates reliance on CITSEG's work. So Basis seems correct. 

I think the answer is Basis.
