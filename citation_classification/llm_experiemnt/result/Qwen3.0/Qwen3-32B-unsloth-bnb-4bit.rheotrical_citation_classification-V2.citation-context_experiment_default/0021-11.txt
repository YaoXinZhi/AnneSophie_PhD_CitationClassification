Okay, let's see. I need to classify the rhetorical function of the citation in the given passage. The passage is: "Similarly, a small aphid gut binding peptide was shown to interfere with enamovirus uptake from pea aphid gut into the hemocoel; the peptide also bound to gut epithelia of two other aphid species suggesting potential broader applicability (CITSEG)."

First, I'll check the possible classes again. The classes are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, Weakness. 

Looking at the context, the sentence starts with "Similarly," which usually indicates a comparison or a similar finding. The citation here is presented as an example that supports the idea of potential broader applicability of the peptide. The phrase "suggesting potential broader applicability" implies that the cited study's results point towards a future research direction or a possible application beyond the current study.

The "Future" class is used when the citation suggests directions for future research. In the example given for "Future," the citation is used to indicate potential broader applicability based on the findings mentioned. The current passage's citation serves a similar purposeâ€”it's pointing out that since the peptide worked in other species, it suggests where future research might go. 

So the rhetorical function here is "Future" because the citation is implying that there's potential for further research or application based on the cited study's results.
