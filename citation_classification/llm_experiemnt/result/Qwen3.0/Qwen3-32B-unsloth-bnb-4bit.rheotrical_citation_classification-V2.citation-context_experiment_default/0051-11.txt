Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. First, I need to understand the context where the citation is placed. The passage provided is: "The experimental set-up was described in details previously (CITSEG)." My job is to assign the correct rhetorical class from the given list.

Looking at the examples given in the prompt, the "Usage" class is exemplified by a sentence where the citation refers to a method or setup used in the current study. The example is very similar to the passage here, where the experimental setup is mentioned as having been described in a previous work. 

The key here is that the citation is not supporting a claim or being compared, but rather it's indicating that the setup was previously detailed in the cited work. The authors are referencing the method directly because they used it in their own experiment. 

I should check other possible classes to be sure. "Basis" might not fit because the cited work isn't the foundation for the new research hereâ€”it's specifically about the setup. "Support" involves using the citation to back up a claim, which isn't the case here. "Neutral" is when the citation is purely descriptive without argumentation, but this one is more about referencing an experimental design. 

"Usage" seems spot on because the sentence directly refers to the method/tool (experimental setup) used in the current study, which was previously described in the cited work. There's no comparison of results, goals, methods with the current paper, so CoCo classes don't apply here. The citation isn't pointing out future work or motivating the current study either. 

Therefore, the correct class is "Usage".
