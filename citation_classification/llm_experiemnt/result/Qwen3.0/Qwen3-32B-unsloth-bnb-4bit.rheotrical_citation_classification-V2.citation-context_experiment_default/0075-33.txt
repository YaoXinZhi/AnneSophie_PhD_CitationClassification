Okay, let's tackle this citation classification problem. First, I need to understand the passage where the (CITSEG) placeholder is used. 

Looking at the example passage provided by the user: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)." The citation here is referring to previous experiments that used deuterium saturated metal targets. 

The key words here are "substantially differ" which indicates that the current results are being compared against those of the cited work. The rhetorical class needs to capture this comparison of results. From the predefined classes, CoCoRes is specifically for comparing or contrasting results or findings. 

The example given under CoCoRes is similar: comparing results of the present work with cited experiments. There's no mention of methods or goals here, just the results. Also, it's not a basis for the current research, nor is it about future directions or support. The citation is used to highlight a difference in outcomes, which aligns perfectly with CoCoRes.

So the correct classification here should be CoCoRes.

{"label": "CoCoRes"}
