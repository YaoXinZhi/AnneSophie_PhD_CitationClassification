Okay, let's tackle this classification task. So, the user provided a passage with a citation placeholder (CITSEG) and wants me to determine which rhetorical class it belongs to. The classes are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, or Weakness. 

First, I need to look at the example provided in the prompt for each class to understand what each one typically entails. Let me recall them briefly:

- **Basis**: The cited work is foundational, like prior research that directly leads to the current study.
- **CoCoGM**: Comparing goals or methods between the cited work and the current paper.
- **CoCoRes**: Comparing results of the cited work with the current findings.
- **CoCoXY**: Comparing two cited studies with each other, not with the current work.
- **Future**: The citation suggests future research directions.
- **Motivation**: The citation points out a need or knowledge gap motivating the current research.
- **Neutral**: The citation is descriptive without argumentation.
- **Similar**: Points out similarities between cited work and current paper.
- **Support**: Supports the authors' claims with previous work.
- **Weakness**: Criticizes or points out flaws in the cited work.

Now, looking at the user's provided example passage:

"The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)."

The key phrase here is "substantially differ from the results of..." So the authors are directly comparing their results with those from the cited study. The citation (CITSEG) is being used to contrast findings. Comparing results would fall under **CoCoRes**, since it's about results. 

Let me check again: CoCoRes says assign when comparing results or findings of the cited work with the citing paper. Exactly matches this scenario where they're contrasting their results with those from the cited experiments. So the label should be CoCoRes.
