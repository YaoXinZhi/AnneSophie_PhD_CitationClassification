Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user wants me to classify a citation in a scientific article into the right rhetorical class based on the given categories. Let me first recall the different classes and their definitions.

The passage provided is: "Similarly, a small aphid gut binding peptide was shown to interfere with enamovirus uptake from pea aphid gut into the hemocoel; the peptide also bound to gut epithelia of two other aphid species suggesting potential broader applicability (CITSEG)."

Looking at the example given for the "Future" class, it's similar in structure. The citation here is used to suggest that the peptide's effect in other aphid species implies broader applicability, which could hint at directions for future research. The word "suggesting" seems to indicate that this finding points towards possible future studies on other species or applications. 

Another possible class could be "Support" if they're reinforcing a claim, but here it's more about indicating potential future work rather than confirming existing findings. "Similar" is about similarity between the cited work and current paper, but here it's about the cited work's results leading to future implications. 

So based on the examples and the description, "Future" seems appropriate here because the citation is used to imply broader applicability, suggesting future research directions.
