Okay, let's try to figure out the appropriate rhetorical class for the given citation passage. The user provided a passage where the task is to classify the role of the citation marked as (CITSEG). 

First, I need to read the example passage carefully. The example given is from the "Support" class: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)." 

In this example, the authors are comparing their results with those from the cited work, stating they are substantially different. Comparing results directly would fall under the CoCoRes (Comparison of Results) category. However, the example under CoCoRes says to use that when comparing the citing paper's results with the cited work's results. 

Looking at the example given under CoCoRes: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted..." which matches the scenario where they are contrasting their findings with the cited study's findings. Therefore, the classification here should be CoCoRes.

I need to ensure that I'm not confusing this with other comparison classes. CoCoGM is about comparing goals or methods, CoCoXY is comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies, not with the citing paper. Since this example is directly contrasting results between the current work and the cited work, it's CoCoRes.
