Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the task is to classify the citation (CITSEG) in the given passage into the correct rhetorical class. First, I need to read the example passage provided and see how it uses the citation.

The example given is: "However, a review of the available literature is rather confusing due to the often contradictory results that were reported. [REF1-REF12]". The corresponding class here is CoCoXY, which is for comparing or contrasting cited studies with each other, not the citing paper. 

In this example, the citation [REF1-REF12] is mentioned in the context of a review of literature that is confusing because of contradictory results. The key point here is that the cited works themselves have conflicting results, and the example is highlighting that contradiction among the studies, not comparing them to the current research. The passage isn't saying that their own results are different from the cited ones (which would be CoCoRes), nor is it using them as a basis for their work (Basis). It's pointing out that among the cited studies (REF1-REF12), there's inconsistency.

Now, when looking at the actual passage from the user's query, it's the same as the example provided for CoCoXY. The sentence structure and context match: talking about contradictory results reported in the cited literature. The rhetorical function is to compare or contrast the cited studies themselves (REF1-REF12) in terms of their explanations or claims. Hence, CoCoXY is the correct classification here.
