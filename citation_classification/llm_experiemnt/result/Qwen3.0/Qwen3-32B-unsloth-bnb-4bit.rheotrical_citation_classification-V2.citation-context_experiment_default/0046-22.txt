Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user wants me to classify the rhetorical class of a citation in a scientific passage. The options are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, or Usage. 

First, I need to understand the passage provided. The example given in the prompt is about comparing their work to another study that proposed a method to "debias" word embeddings. They mention that their work is complementary because they focus on demonstrating biases instead. 

Looking at the example, the citation here is used to compare the goals or methods of their work with the cited paper. The key phrases here are "Most closely related...", "propose a method...", and "Our work is complementary..." which indicate a comparison of methods or goals. 

So according to the classes, CoCoGM is for comparing goals or methods. The example given in the CoCoGM description matches the scenario here. The cited work's method is being compared to the current paper's approach. 

I should check if it's not another class like Basis or Support. Basis would be if they're building directly on the prior work, but here it's about being complementary. Support would be if they're backing up their claim with the citation, but they're contrasting their focus. 

Also, CoCoRes would be comparing results, but the example is about methods. CoCoXY is for comparing explanations between two cited studies, which isn't the case here. So CoCoGM makes sense here.
