Okay, let's tackle this classification task. First, I need to understand the context of the citation given in the example. The user provided a passage where the citation is mentioned: "However, a review of the available literature is rather confusing due to the often contradictory results that were reported. [REF1-REF12]". 

The task is to assign the correct rhetorical class to this citation. The possible classes include CoCoXY, which is for comparing two cited studies with each other, not with the citing paper. 

The example given for CoCoXY mentions that the literature review is confusing because of contradictory results between different cited studies. In the provided passage, the authors are pointing out that there's confusion in the literature due to contradictory results from various studies, which are the ones listed as [REF1-REF12]. This seems to fit the CoCoXY category because they're contrasting different cited studies with each other, not comparing the citing paper's results or methods with those studies. 

Looking at other classes, Basis isn't right because the cited works aren't the foundation. CoCoGM is about comparing goals/methods, which isn't the case here. CoCoRes involves comparing results of the cited work with the citing paper, which also doesn't fit. Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, Weakness don't apply here either. 

Therefore, the correct classification here is CoCoXY.
