Okay, let's tackle this classification problem. First, I need to carefully read the given citation passage. The example sentence mentions two citations (CITSEG, CITSEG) in a comparison of contradictory results in the literature. The options here include CoCoXY since the citation is comparing two studies with each other.

The first step is to identify the rhetorical class based on the predefined categories. The passage says "often contradictory results that were reported. [REF1-REF12]". This seems to indicate a comparison between cited studies rather than contrasting the current work with another's methods, results, or goals. CoCoXY is specifically for comparing cited studies with each other, not the citing paper.

Looking at the CoCoXY example provided, it's exactly this scenario: "a review of the available literature is rather confusing due to the often contradictory results that were reported. [REF1-REF12]". The citations here (REF1-REF12) are part of the literature review where contradictory results exist between the cited works. The CoCoXY class fits because it's highlighting discrepancies between two cited studies.

So, in the given passage, CITSEG is functioning similarly. The citation is being used to reference conflicting findings in multiple studies. Therefore, the correct class should be CoCoXY.
