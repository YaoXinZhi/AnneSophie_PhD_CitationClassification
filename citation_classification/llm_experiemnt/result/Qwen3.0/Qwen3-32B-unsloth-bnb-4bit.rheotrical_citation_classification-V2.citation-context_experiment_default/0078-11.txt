Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the rhetorical class of the citation in the given passage. First, I'll look at the context around the CITSEG placeholder.

The passage says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)." 

Hmm, the key phrase here is "substantially differ". The authors are comparing their results to those from the cited work. The class CoCoRes is for comparing results, which fits because they're directly contrasting their findings with the cited study's results. The example given for CoCoRes also has a similar structure, mentioning differing results. So I think the correct class here is CoCoRes.

{
  "label": "CoCoRes"
