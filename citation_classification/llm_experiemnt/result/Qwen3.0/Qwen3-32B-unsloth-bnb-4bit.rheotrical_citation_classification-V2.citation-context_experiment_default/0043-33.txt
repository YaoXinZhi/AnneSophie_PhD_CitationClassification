Okay, let's tackle this classification. The user provided a passage where I need to determine the rhetorical class of the citation denoted by (CITSEG). Let me first read through the example again to understand the context.

The example given is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)." The assigned class here is CoCoRes, which is used when comparing results or findings with the cited work and the citing paper.

Now, looking at the user's specific case. The passage around the CITSEG mention that the current work's results substantially differ. This indicates a direct comparison between the results of the current study and those from previous experiments cited. According to the guidelines, CoCoRes is the appropriate class when the citation is used for comparison of results. There's no mention of contrasting methods or goals, nor is it about future work or neutrality. Hence, CoCoRes fits here.
