Okay, let's tackle this citation classification task step by step. First, I need to understand the given passage and identify the rhetorical role of the citation marked as (CITSEG). 

Looking at the example provided, the citation is used towards the end. The sentence states that the results obtained in the present work differ substantially from those of experiments using deuterium saturated metal targets mentioned in (CITSEG). The key phrase here is "substantially differ from the results," which directly points to a comparison of the findings or results between the current study and the cited work. 

The rhetorical classes available include CoCoRes, which is specifically for comparing or contrasting results. The example given under CoCoRes matches this scenario closely. The passage isn't just contrasting methods or goals but the actual outcomes of the experiments. There's no mention of future research, motivation, similarity, or weaknesses in the cited work here. The citation serves to highlight a discrepancy in results, which is best categorized under CoCoRes.
