Okay, let me try to figure out the rhetorical class for this citation. The passage says, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)." 

Looking at the options, the key part here is "substantially differ from the results..." which indicates that they're comparing their results with those from the cited work. The example given for CoCoRes uses similar wording: comparing or contrasting results or findings. The Basis class would be if the cited work is the foundation, but here it's a direct comparison of results. It's not about methods or goals, which would be CoCoGM. Also, there's no neutral mention or weakness pointed out. So it must be CoCoRes.
