Okay, let's tackle this citation classification task. I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the given passage. The user provided a list of possible classes like Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, etc. 

First, I'll read the example passage again to understand the context. The example says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)."

So here, the citation is mentioned in comparison with the current study's results. The key phrase here is "substantially differ from the results of..." which directly points to comparing findings. Looking at the classes, CoCoRes is for comparing results or findings. The example given under CoCoRes also matches this structure, where the current results are contrasted with those from the cited work. 

I need to check if there's any other possible class that might fit. For instance, CoCoGM is about comparing goals or methods, but here it's the results that are being compared, not the methods or goals. Basis would be if the cited work is foundational, but this is a contrast. Motivation or Future don't fit here. Neutral is when there's no direct argument, but here there's a clear comparison of outcomes. Support would be if the citation backs up the current claims, but in this case, it's a difference. So CoCoRes is definitely the right class here.
