Okay, let's see. I need to classify the citation in the given passage into one of the rhetorical classes. First, I should read the passage carefully. 

The example provided is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)."

Hmm. The key part here is comparing the results of the current work with those from another study using specific materials. The citation here is referring to previous experiments whose results are being compared. The class CoCoRes is for comparing results. Let me check the definition again. CoCoRes is when the citation is used to directly compare or contrast results or findings. 

In the example, they mention that their results "substantially differ" from the cited experiments. That's a direct comparison of results. So the correct class here would be CoCoRes. 

I should also make sure it's not a different class like CoCoGM (which is about goals or methods) or Basis. But here, the focus is on results, not methods or the foundation of the research. Therefore, CoCoRes is the right choice.
