Okay, let's tackle this citation classification. First, I need to understand the passage and how the citation is used. The example given is about a citation compared to the literature review's confusing nature due to contradictory results. The example itself refers to multiple references (REF1-REF12) and the class is CoCoXY because it's comparing cited studies with each other, not the citing paper.

Now, looking at the user's provided input for classification, I need to determine which rhetorical class fits. The passage states: "However, a review of the available literature is rather confusing due to the often contradictory results that were reported. [REF1-REF12]." Here, the citation [REF1-REF12] is used to highlight conflicting results among the cited studies themselves. The authors aren't comparing their own work to these studies but are pointing out contradictions between the cited works. 

Comparing this to the classes, CoCoXY is for comparing explanations or claims between cited studies. Since the example given for CoCoXY involves a review of literature with contradictory results reported in the cited works (REF1-REF12), the user's passage matches this scenario. There's no mention of comparing methods, results with their own study, or motivating their research; it's purely about contrasting the cited studies. Therefore, CoCoXY is the correct class.
