Okay, let me try to figure this out. The task is to classify the rhetorical function of the citation in the given passage. The passage is: "in the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 (CITSEG)." 

Looking at the examples provided for each class, the Neutral class example is almost identical. The example says, "in the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 (CITSEG)." The user's passage is exactly the same. 

In the Neutral class description, it's meant for citations used in a neutral, descriptive way without supporting, comparing, criticizing, or motivating any specific argument. The example here is just stating a fact without any further argumentation. The citation is providing background information, not serving as a basis for the current research, nor is it being compared or contrasted with the current work. It's just stating that the use of these devices has been spreading since a certain year.

So the correct classification here would be Neutral because the citation is used to present a factual statement without any supporting, contrasting, or motivating role in the current paper's argument.
