Okay, let's tackle this. Alright, the task is to classify the citation in the given passage into one of the rhetorical classes provided. The user provided an example where the citation was used to compare results with the cited work.

First, I need to read the example again to make sure I understand. The example says that the results in the present work differ from those conducted with deuterium saturated targets. The citation here is used to contrast their own results with the cited study's results. 

Looking at the classes, CoCoRes is specifically for comparing results. The key here is whether the citation is about contrasting findings between the current paper and the cited work. The example given in the user's setup for CoCoRes matches this scenario exactly. 

So the next step is to check the provided passage against the other classes. Let's see if any other class might fit. For Basis, the cited work would be foundational to the current research. Motivation would be if it's pointing out a knowledge gap. Support would be if the citation backs up the current claims. But in the example, the authors are saying their results are different, which is a direct comparison of outcomes. 

Comparing with CoCoGM would involve methods or goals, not results. CoCoXY is for explaining contradictory studies with each other, not contrasting with the current paper. Future is for suggesting research directions. Neutral is just descriptive without argument. Similar would point out likeness in results, but here it's difference. Weakness would critique the cited work's flaws, not contrasting results. 

Therefore, the correct classification here is CoCoRes.
