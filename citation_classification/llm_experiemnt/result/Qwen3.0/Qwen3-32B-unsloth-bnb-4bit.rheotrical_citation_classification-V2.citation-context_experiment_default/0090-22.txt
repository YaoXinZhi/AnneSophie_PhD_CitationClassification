Okay, let's tackle this classification task. The user provided a citation passage and I need to determine the correct rhetorical class from the given list. 

First, I need to recall the definitions of each class. Let me go through them briefly. The "Basis" class is when the cited work is foundational to the current research. "CoCoGM" is comparisons of goals or methods, "CoCoRes" for results comparison, "CoCoXY" for comparing explanations or claims between studies. "Future" is for future research directions. "Motivation" is about why the research is done, like a knowledge gap. "Neutral" is descriptive without argumentation. "Similar" indicates similarity between cited work and current work. "Support" is when the citation backs up a claim, and "Usage" is about methods or tools used. "Weakness" criticizes cited work's flaws.

Now, looking at the example given in the prompt: "However, a review of the available literature is rather confusing due to the often contradictory results that were reported. [REF1-REF12]". The correct class here is CoCoXY because it's comparing the explanations or claims between different cited studies, not contrasting them with the current paper.

For the user's specific case, the sentence is about contradictory results in the literature review, pointing out differences among cited studies (REF1-REF12). According to the examples, CoCoXY is appropriate here as it's a comparison between the cited studies themselves, not with the citing paper's work or results. There's no mention of the current paper's findings or methods contrasting with the cited ones. It's about the cited studies contradicting each other, hence CoCoXY.
