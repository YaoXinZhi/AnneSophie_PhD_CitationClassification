Okay, let's see. I need to classify the rhetorical class of the CITSEG in this example. The example given is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)." 

First, I'll look at the sentence structure. The phrase "substantially differ from the results of the experiments" indicates that they are comparing their results with those from the cited work. The key here is that the comparison is about the results themselves, not the methods or goals. The class CoCoRes is for comparing results or findings.

Looking at the example provided for CoCoRes, it's exactly this scenario where the citing paper is contrasting their results with a previous study's results. The other classes like CoCoGM would involve comparing goals or methods, which isn't the case here. Basis is about foundational work, which doesn't fit. Support would be if they were using the citation to back up their claims, but here they're showing a difference. So the correct class here is CoCoRes.
