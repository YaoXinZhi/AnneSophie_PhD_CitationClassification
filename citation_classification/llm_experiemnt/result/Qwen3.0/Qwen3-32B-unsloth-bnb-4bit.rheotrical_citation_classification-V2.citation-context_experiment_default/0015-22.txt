Okay, let's tackle this citation classification problem. The task is to determine which rhetorical class the (CITSEG) placeholder belongs to in the given citation passage. First, I need to carefully read the provided passage and understand the context in which the citation is used.

The example given is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)." 

Looking at the rhetorical classes listed, the relevant one here seems like it could be CoCoRes, which is for comparing or contrasting results. The phrase "substantially differ from the results" directly points to a comparison of outcomes between the current study and the cited work. 

The CoCoRes example provided in the prompt matches this scenario: when results are compared. The example states, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ..." which aligns with comparing experimental results. Therefore, the correct class should be CoCoRes. Other classes like Basis or Support don't fit because the citation isn't being used to build upon prior work or support a claim, but rather to highlight a difference in results. Similarly, CoCoGM would relate to goals or methods, which is not the case here. So, CoCoRes is the most appropriate label.
