Okay, let's see. I need to classify the citation here. The user provided a passage where the citation is used. Let me look at the example given.

The passage says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)."

Hmm, the key here is the phrase "substantially differ from the results of the experiments..." So they are comparing their results with those from the cited work. The class CoCoRes is for comparing results. The example given in the instructions for CoCoRes matches this scenario exactly. The citation is used to contrast the findings. So this should be CoCoRes. I don't think it's Basis or Support because they aren't building on the prior work or supporting their claim. It's a direct comparison of results. Yeah, definitely CoCoRes.
