Okay, let's start by examining the given example passage and the correct classification to understand why it's CoCoXY.

The example is: "However, a review of the available literature is rather confusing due to the often contradictory results that were reported. [REF1-REF12]". The explanation states that the citation is used to compare two studies with each other, not with the citing paper. 

So, the key here is contrasting different cited studies. Now, looking at the given test sentence: "In the same year, the effect was studied also in wheat plants, where the pathogen did not reach the upper fully expanded blade and only lesions were observed in the youngest leaves, while in barley the pathogen progressed from the youngest blade to the upper fully expanded one (CITSEG)."

The CITSEG here is referring to a study that contrasted findings between wheat and barley plantsâ€”the pathogen's effect differed in these two crops. The authors are contrasting two results (wheat vs. barley) within the cited work. Therefore, the rhetorical function is comparing explanations or claims between cited studies, which fits CoCoXY.
