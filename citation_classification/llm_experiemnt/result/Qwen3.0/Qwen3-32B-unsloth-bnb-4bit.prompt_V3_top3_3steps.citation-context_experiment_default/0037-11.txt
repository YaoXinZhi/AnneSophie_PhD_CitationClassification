Okay, let's start with Step 1. I need to extract the context around the @@CITATION@@ in the scientific passage provided. Let me look for the sentence that contains the citation to understand the surrounding discussion.

Once I find the sentence, I'll parse the surrounding sentences or phrases that explain why the citation is being referenced. Then, moving to Step 2, I'll identify the general intent. Is the citation providing foundational information for the research? Comparing goals, methods, results, or explanations with other works? Justifying the need for the research? Motivating future studies? Supporting the authors' claims? Demonstrating similarities? Describing usage of methods? Pointing out weaknesses? Or is it neutral?

Based on the intent, I'll determine the appropriate rhetorical class labels. For example, if the citation is establishing a basis, then Basis is appropriate. If it's comparing results, then CoCoRes might be the top class. Next, in Step 3, I'll rank the top three classes according to their relevance in the citation's context, considering the examples provided for each class to ensure accuracy.

Let me proceed through these steps based on the actual passage provided.
