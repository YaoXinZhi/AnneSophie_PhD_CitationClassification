Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the citation tagged @@CITATION@@. The passage says, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." The key part here is the direct comparison between the current results and those from previous experiments. 

Next, identifying the general intent. The sentence is contrasting the present findings with past results. That fits into the Comparative category. Looking at the subclasses, comparing results specifically would fall under CoCoRes. But there's a mention of the cited work's experiments, so maybe there's also a comparison of methods or goals? The example for CoCoGM involves methods, but here it's about results. 

CoCoRes is definitely primary here. Then maybe the example given in CoCoRes matches this. Since the author is contrasting their results with another's findings, CoCoRes is first. Then Neutral? Wait, is there any other intent? The example includes a direct contrast, so CoCoRes is primary. Then maybe Neutral if there's no further comparison. Alternatively, maybe CoCoRes is the main one, and if there's another, maybe it's Neutral if they just mention it without further analysis. Looking at the example for Neutral, it's more descriptive without support or comparison. Here the comparison is direct, so Neutral isn't the case. 

Wait, the example for CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies without the citing paper. In this case, the comparison is between current work and cited work, so CoCoRes fits. Another possible class could be Support? But the sentence isn't supporting; it's contrasting. So CoCoRes is first. The user needs three classes. If there's no other obvious classes, perhaps CoCoRes is first, then maybe Neutral if there's a descriptive element, but the sentence is about contrasting results. Maybe CoCoXY isn't applicable here because it's comparing cited studies with each other, not the citing paper. 

Hmm, I think CoCoRes is the primary class here. Then maybe Neutral isn't applicable because it's active comparison. Perhaps the third class is Basis? No, Basis is foundational. The sentence isn't establishing a foundation but contrasting. Maybe Weakness or Motivation? The citation isn't pointing out a flaw or motivating the research. So probably CoCoRes is first, and then maybe Basis is not applicable. Wait, the example given for CoCoRes matches exactly this scenario. The user's example is similar: "The results obtained... differ from..." with the citation. So CoCoRes is the top class. Then what else? The text doesn't indicate a second comparison. Maybe Neutral is the second if there's no other intent. But the example for Neutral is a descriptive mention without support or comparison. Since this is directly comparing results, Neutral would rank lower. So CoCoRes is first, Neutral is second. Wait, maybe the comparison is explicit, so Neutral isn't the second. Maybe Weakness or Support. The sentence isn't supporting or criticizing, so Weakness is out. Neutral is the safest next. Third could be Basis if the cited work is foundational but no, in this case, the cited work is providing results to contrast against. So Neutral is third. Wait, maybe the classes should be CoCoRes, then maybe CoCoGM or CoCoXY? Let me check again. The example for CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies, but here it's comparing the current work with cited. CoCoGM and CoCoRes are about comparing goals/methods vs results. The user's sentence is comparing results, so CoCoRes is first. The remaining classes could be Basis, Motivation, etc. Since the context here is about differing results, perhaps Basis isn't relevant. So ranking CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral third if the citation is only descriptive but in the example given, CoCoRes is about differing results. Neutral's example is descriptive, but here it's comparative. Therefore, CoCoRes is first, maybe Neutral is third? Let me see the examples again. Neutral example is more like stating facts without comparison. Here the context is comparison of results. So CoCoRes is first. Second could be Neutral if there's a descriptive aspect, which there isn't. Wait, maybe the third is CoCoGM because they compared experimental methods? The cited work used deuterium saturated targets, and the current uses something else. So CoCoGM could be comparing methods. But the sentence says the results differ from experiments conducted with deuterium targets. So maybe CoCoRes is comparing results, and CoCoGM is comparing methods. So in that case, the two classes could be CoCoRes and CoCoGM. Let me look at the example for CoCoGM: comparing goals or methods. The example given mentions methods being complementary. The sentence here mentions different experimental setups (deuterium targets vs whatever they used), so maybe CoCoGM is also applicable as comparing methods. Therefore, the top two classes are CoCoRes and CoCoGM. The third class could be Neutral or Basis. But in the context, there's no indication of it being foundational or supportive. So maybe Neutral third. Wait, the example for CoCoRes includes comparing results, and in this case, the comparison is direct. So probably CoCoRes is first, CoCoGM second, Neutral third. Wait, but the example for CoCoRes doesn't involve CoCoGM. Hmm, maybe not. I'm getting confused here. Let's think again. The sentence is comparing results (CoCoRes) and possibly the methods they used (deuterium targets). So CoCoGM would be comparing methods. If the author mentions that their methods are different (using deuterium saturated targets), then CoCoGM is applicable. But the original sentence is about results differing from previous experiments using those targets. So the focus is on results difference, so CoCoRes is first. Then maybe CoCoGM if they're comparing methods. But the sentence doesn't explicitly say their goals or methods are different. It just says their results differ. So perhaps CoCoRes is first, then maybe CoCoXY if they're contrasting two studies. Wait, CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies, but here it's comparing the cited study with the current work. So CoCoXY isn't applicable. Therefore, the top class is CoCoRes. Then maybe the second could be Basis if the cited study provides foundational work, but the example here isn't about that. Wait, the citation is being used to contrast results, so Basis is not applicable. The third class could be Neutral if there's a neutral mention, but the context is active comparison. Maybe Weakness if the cited work's results are problematic? No, the authors just say their results differ, not that the cited ones are flawed. So Weakness isn't likely. Therefore, CoCoRes is first, Neutral is second if forced, but maybe the correct classes are just CoCoRes. Let me check the user's examples again. The example for CoCoRes is exactly matching the scenario where the results are stated to differ from another's results. So CoCoRes is definitely first. The other possible classes might be CoCoGM if methods are compared. Let's see the user's sentence: "the results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." Here, the author is contrasting their results with previous ones which used different experimental setups (deuterium targets). That implies a comparison of methods (the cited work used deuterium targets; current work didn't?), leading to different results. So the methods might be different, hence CoCoGM. Because CoCoGM is comparison of goals or methods. So if the methods are contrasting, CoCoGM is applicable. Therefore, CoCoRes is first, CoCoGM is second. What about third? Then maybe Neutral. Because even if comparing methods and results, the third class could be Neutral. Wait, Neutral is when it's just descriptive. Since CoCoRes and CoCoGM are both comparative, and Neutral is the rest, maybe Neutral is third. So the ranking is CoCoRes, CoCoGM, Neutral.
