Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step.

**First, I need to understand the context of the citation marked @@CITATION@@ in the provided passage.** 

The passage says:
"Our results are in agreement with those of previous studies on the same subject where it was demonstrated that the presence of certain pathogens in the plant can influence the expression of specific genes. This was previously shown by @@CITATION@@ using a related plant species."

So the surrounding context is about agreeing with previous findings, specifically pointing to a study that showed pathogens influencing gene expression.

**Next, analyze the intent of the citation.** 

The phrase "in agreement with those of previous studies" suggests the citation supports the current work's findings. The author is reinforcing their results by referencing another study that found similar outcomes.

**Now, identify the rhetorical class.**

From the definition, "Support" is used when the citation is used to support or confirm the citing authors' work. Here, the authors are aligning their findings with those cited, implying the cited work backs up their own conclusions.

Could it be similar? Well, the passage mentions agreement, which is a form of support. Since the cited work is confirming the current results, "Support" is the primary rhetorical class.

Checking other possibilities: 

- CoCoRes compares results directly, which could apply since the cited work's results are being aligned with the current one. But in CoCoRes, there's usually a direct contrast. Since the author says "are in agreement," maybe "Similar" could be an option too as it points out a similarity between cited work and current work.

Wait, the example for Similar mentions that the cited work found similar results or patterns. So "Similar" might fit here as well. However, the author isn't just pointing out similarity but actually using it to confirm their findings, which is more aligned with Support.

Additionally, Neutral is used when the citation is purely descriptive. Here, the citation isn't just mentioning the study's existence but is supporting an existing finding. So Neutral wouldn't fit.

Between Support and Similar, I believe Support is more accurate because the phrase is used to substantiate the claim. Maybe CoCoRes is possible if contrasting results were mentioned, but the author isn't contrasting—they are agreeing. So CoCoRes probably doesn't apply here.

Therefore, the main rhetorical class is Support. 

Next, maybe Similar since they mention agreement, indicating similarity. So the top two could be Support followed by Similar.

Is there a third possible? Basis might be relevant if they're building on a foundational study, but the phrase doesn’t suggest introducing a foundation—it's more about confirming. 

CoCoXY could come into play if there's a comparison between two cited studies, but here it's only one cited work and their own findings.

Motivation or Future don’t apply here either.

Thus, the top three would be Support, then Similar, perhaps with Basis or Neutral further down. Wait, Neutral isn't really fitting here. Since Neutral is when the citation is descriptive without supporting anything. But the author is using the citation to support agreement. Therefore, Neutral might not be third unless another class is more appropriate. 

Maybe the third could be CoCoRes if the alignment is seen as a comparison of results. However, CoCoRes typically involves a direct contrast. Since the results are in agreement, maybe CoCoRes isn't correct. Neutral is possible but doesn't fit perfectly.

Given the definitions and examples provided, I think the correct classes are Support, then Similar, then maybe Basis or Neutral. But Neutral might not be correct. Given the example for Basis is about introducing a foundational study, and here the cited work is a previous study with similar findings, maybe Weakness? But the passage doesn’t criticize the cited work.

So final breakdown:
1. Support
2. Similar
3. CoCoRes (if considering alignment as comparison of results)

Alternatively, perhaps Neutral is third, but I think Neutral isn’t correct here. Since Support is most accurate, then Similar would be second, maybe Basis could be third if the cited work laid the groundwork for these findings. The passage doesn't use terms like "introduced" or "validated," so Basis might not apply. 

Hmm.

Considering all possibilities again:

- Support fits the best: the citation is used to support the current work's findings by citing another study with agreement.

- Similar could follow: indicating similarity between studies.

- CoCoRes is a stretch here but could be considered if the alignment is seen as a result comparison.

But since CoCoRes requires direct comparison, which might not be present here, maybe Neutral is better as the third. But Neutral is when the citation is used in a descriptive way. Since the citation is actually supporting an argument, Neutral wouldn't be right. 

Therefore, the correct ranking would be Support first, then Similar second. If Basis isn’t applicable and CoCoRes doesn't fit well, maybe Neutral would be third as a fallback. But given the context is more about support, Neutral seems incorrect.

Wait, maybe CoCoRes does apply here. If the authors are comparing their results directly with the cited study's results (since they agree), then CoCoRes would be appropriate. The example given for CoCoRes is about differing results, but the class itself refers to comparing results, whether agreeing or not. So aligning with another study's results might still fall under CoCoRes.

Thus, the correct ranking would be:

1. Support

2. CoCoRes

3. Similar

But I'm not sure. Let me check definitions again.

Support: the citation supports the work, result, or finding.

CoCoRes: direct comparison of results.

Similar: similarity between cited work and citing paper.

In this case, the authors say "our results are in agreement with those of previous studies"—this supports their findings by citing supporting work. So Support is primary. Additionally, agreeing indicates similarity, so Similar is secondary. If there's a direct comparison of findings, which might be the case, then CoCoRes could be third. Alternatively, maybe Neutral.

Hmm. I'm torn between CoCoRes and Similar here. Given the example provided for Similar is about similarity in findings, which matches this context exactly, I think Similar should be ranked second.

But why is Support different from Similar? Support is more about reinforcing your own findings with a reference, while Similar is pointing out similarity between works. So the authors are using the reference to both support their own findings and show similarity with the cited work's findings.

Hence:

1. Support

2. Similar

3. CoCoRes

But maybe Neutral isn't fitting here, CoCoRes would come third. Alternatively, perhaps Neutral is third, but I think Neutral doesn't apply because they’re not just mentioning the existence of a study but supporting their own conclusion with the cited work's findings. So CoCoRes might actually be appropriate if comparing the results between their study and the cited study. 

Final decision:

1. Support

2. Similar

3. CoCoRes

1. Support  
2. Similar  
3. CoCoRes
