Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to classify the given citation using the three most appropriate rhetorical classes. First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The provided passage is:

"The detection of phytoplasmas was attempted by direct PCR on leaves from naturally infected plants collected between January to April in 2017 using primer pairs 16S–23S, R16F2/R2 and P1/P7 for the amplification of the 16S rRNA gene, 16S-23S spacer region, and the intergenic spacer region of 16S–23S rRNA operon, respectively. The phylogenetic analysis was carried out with RFLP analysis of amplified fragments as previously reported @@CITATION@@."

So the context here is about methods used in PCR detection of phytoplasmas, and they mention using RFLP analysis as previously reported, citing another study.

Next, I need to determine the general intent. The citation is referring to a method (RFLP analysis) that was previously reported. Looking at the definitions, "Usage" is when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup from the cited work that is directly used in the current study. The example given for Usage mentions an experimental setup described previously. In this case, the current study uses RFLP analysis as described in the cited work, so that's a clear case of Usage.

Now, are there other classes that might apply? Let's see. CoCoGM compares goals or methods between the citing paper and cited work. Here, they're not comparing their methods with the cited ones but using the cited method directly. Support would be if they're supporting their findings with the cited work's results, but they're just mentioning the method's source. Neutral is if it's just descriptive without supporting or comparing. However, the example for Usage includes referring to a method from the cited work, which fits here better than Neutral. Basis would be if the cited work is the foundation for the current research, but here it's more about using a specific method they didn't invent.

So the top class here should be Usage. Then, maybe Neutral? Wait, the example for Neutral says something like "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment...", which is just stating a fact based on the citation. But in this case, the authors are stating they used RFLP analysis as previously reported, which is citing the method's origin, so Usage is more precise. Are there other possible classes?

Alternatively, maybe Future or Motivation? No, since the citation is not about future research or motivating the study. It's about methodology usage. So the top class is definitely Usage. Then, perhaps CoCoXY? Wait, CoCoXY is comparing cited studies with each other, not with the current paper. Neutral could be here because it's just mentioning the method's prior existence. Wait, but Usage is when methods are used from the cited work, which is exactly what's happening here. So Usage is 1.

Looking at other possibilities: Support would be if they used the cited work's results to support their own findings, but they are using the method. CoCoGM is comparing goals/methods between papers, but they're not contrasting goals—they're just using the cited method. So probably, after Usage, Neutral might come next. Wait, Neutral example includes citing a fact without direct use of the method. But here, the authors are using the method from the cited work, which is Usage. Wait, maybe Neutral isn't really applicable here. Let me check the definitions again.

Usage: refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup from the cited work that is directly used in the current study. The example is "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@" which fits. Neutral is when it's just descriptive without specific argument. So in this case, the citation is directly referring to the method's prior description. Therefore, the correct primary class is Usage.

Are there any secondary classes? Maybe Support or Similar? No, they're not comparing results or supporting their findings. Perhaps Neutral is not needed. Wait, the instruction says to output top three classes. Let me think again.

Wait, could there be a possibility that CoCoXY is relevant? That's comparing two cited studies. If the citation is contrasting two studies, but in this case, the paper is referring to one cited work's method. So CoCoXY isn't applicable here. CoCoGM is comparing goals or methods between citing paper and cited work, which isn't happening here—they're using the cited method, not comparing their goals. So after Usage as primary, perhaps Neutral? Maybe Not Neutral is better than nothing else. Or maybe Usage is the only applicable, but the user requires three classes. Let me see if there's a possible second or third.

Looking back, maybe Support? For example, if they're supporting the validity of their method by citing prior work. The sentence says "as previously reported @@CITATION@@", which could imply support for using RFLP analysis. If Support is when the citation is used to support a result or finding, but here it's supporting the method validity. Maybe Support is applicable here. But the example for Support is like confirming results. Hmm.

Alternatively, Neutral might still fit if they're just stating factually that the method was used. Wait, the example for Usage includes citing the experimental setup, which is the same here. So I think Usage is definitely primary. Maybe Neutral could be secondary if there's no direct comparison. But perhaps Neutral isn't necessary here. Alternatively, maybe the citation is part of Neutral and Usage. Wait, maybe Usage is the only one here, but the task requires three. The user's instruction may require me to give three classes even if some are not strong fits.

Alternatively, maybe Usage is first, then perhaps Neutral or Support? Let me think again.

The sentence says "as previously reported @@CITATION@@", meaning that they are citing the cited work's prior reporting of the method. That supports their usage of RFLP analysis by citing previous validation. So Support could be a secondary class here because they're substantiating their method choice by referring to prior work. But Usage is the main reason. So perhaps Usage is first, then Support as secondary. Then Neutral as third? But maybe Neutral isn't really applicable. Alternatively, maybe only two classes are possible, but the task requires three. So perhaps include Neutral as third even if it's weak.

Alternatively, maybe the third class isn't applicable. But the instruction says to return three. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the primary is Usage, secondary is CoCoGM because they are using the method in their study, implying a comparison of methods? Wait no, CoCoGM is when comparing goals/methods between current and cited. Here, they are not contrasting methods but using the cited method. So maybe no CoCoGM.

In conclusion, primary is Usage, secondary could be Support, and third Neutral. Let me check the example of Support again. Support example includes "participants did not distinguish...", confirming prior results. In this case, they are confirming that the method was previously reported. Maybe that's Support in terms of supporting their method's validity. So maybe Support is second. Then Neutral third. Alternatively, maybe Neutral isn't right here. Alternatively, maybe Neutral and Support aren't applicable. Maybe after Usage, the next could be None, but instructions require three. Hmm.

This is tricky. Given the example for Usage fits perfectly, and the citation is definitely in Usage category. Next, perhaps Motivation isn't. Then perhaps Neutral. Let me proceed with:

1. Usage  
2. Support  
3. Neutral  

But maybe Support isn't strong. Alternatively, maybe Neutral is second. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps Neutral isn't needed. Alternatively, maybe the third is Future or something else. But the citation isn't suggesting future work. Given the ambiguity, perhaps proceed with the top three as Usage, Neutral, CoCoGM or CoCoXY. But CoCoXY isn't applicable. Alternatively, Neutral as second. 

Wait, Neutral's example includes citing a fact without argument, which is similar here—they are stating that the method was previous reported. So perhaps Neutral is second. So the ranking is:

1. Usage  
2. Neutral  
3. Support  

But maybe Support is more accurate than Neutral. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps Support is better than Neutral. Because citing prior work as a reason to use their method could be support. 

But the example for Support involves confirming subscales, which is results. Here, it's confirming method validity. So maybe Support is still applicable. 

Therefore, final decision:

1. Usage  
2. Support  
3. Neutral  

But maybe Neutral is better than Support. Hmm. I think Usage is primary, Neutral second, CoCoGM third? Wait, no CoCoGM isn't applicable. Maybe Neutral is third if needed. But the instruction requires three, so proceeding with three.
