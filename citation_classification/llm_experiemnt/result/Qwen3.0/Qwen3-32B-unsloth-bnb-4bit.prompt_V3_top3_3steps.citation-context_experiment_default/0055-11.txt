Okay, I need to analyze the given passage to determine the correct rhetorical classes for the citation marked @@CITATION@@. Let's start by extracting the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the study's results differ from a previous experiment conducted with deuterium saturated metal targets. For example, Wei et al., 2004 observed high concentrations in young leaves and roots, while Saracco et al., 2006 reported conflicting results. Then there's the citation in question discussing a phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima. The context here is comparing different results from different studies, pointing out conflicts in their findings.

The general intent here seems to be a comparative one, as the author is contrasting the results of their study with those mentioned earlier. Comparing findings would fall under CoCoRes according to the definitions provided. They mention conflicting results, which is a direct comparison of results between studies. But there's also mention of two different studies (Wei et al., 2004 and Saracco et al., 2006) being compared to each other via the cited study. That might involve CoCoXY as well since it's comparing explanations or claims between cited works. 

So the primary class is CoCoRes because the citation is used to compare conflicting results directly. The secondary might be CoCoXY since there are conflicting results between two cited studies. The third would likely be Neutral if there's no strong support or motivation present. There's no direct support or usage mentioned here, and the intent is descriptive in pointing out conflicting findings without a specific argument or motivation for further research. So Neutral could be the third class.

1. CoCoRes  
2. CoCoXY  
3. Neutral
