Okay, let's tackle this classification. First, I need to extract the context around the @@CITATION@@ mention in the provided passage. Let me read through the passage again.

The passage says: "The efficacy of the current biofungicides in controlling damping-off disease caused by Rhizopus solani was evaluated, with results showing a significant reduction in disease incidence compared to untreated controls (Liu et al., 2020). In contrast, similar applications using commercial chemical fungicides showed even higher efficacy @@CITATION@@."

So the citation here is referring to another study that also used fungicides, but commercial ones, and showed higher efficacy. The phrase "In contrast" indicates a comparison between the biofungicides study and this other commercial fungicides study. The purpose here is to highlight the difference in efficacy results between the two approaches.

Now, identifying the general intent. Since this is a direct comparison of results between the current biofungicides (from Liu et al.) and another study (the @@CITATION@@), the mention is to compare the outcomes. So the intent falls under comparative.

Next, the specific rhetorical classes. The comparison here is of results because the efficacy levels are being compared. That points to CoCoRes as the primary class. Then, since they're contrasting their results with another study's, maybe CoCoRes is the top one. Also, the fact that they're using "In contrast" sets up a comparison between their findings and the cited study's, so CoCoRes fits. 

Is there any other class? Maybe CoCoGM? No, because it's about results, not goals or methods. CoCoXY is for explanations or claims between studies, but here it's direct results comparison. Neutral doesn't fit because there's an active comparison happening. Support isn't right since they are contrasting, not supporting. Motivation or Future aren't relevant here. Weakness isn't applicable either. 

So top three would be CoCoRes first, then maybe CoCoGM if there's method comparison. Wait, the passage says "similar applications using commercial chemical fungicides," which implies the methods might be similar, but they're contrasting the results. So maybe CoCoRes is first, then CoCoGM if they compared methods. Wait, the method could be similar (applications), but the outcome is different. So CoCoRes (comparison of results) is first. Second could be CoCoGM if there's a mention of goals or methods, but the example given here doesn't specify differences in goals or methods beyond the type of fungicides used. Maybe CoCoGM isn't applicable. Then maybe Neutral? No, because there's an active comparison. Alternatively, maybe CoCoXY if comparing two different explanations. Hmm. The example given in CoCoXY involves contrasting two studies without the citing paper. Here, the citing paper is comparing itself to CoCoRes study. Wait, the example for CoCoRes says "directly compare or contrast the results or findings of the cited work with those of the citing paper." So that's exactly what's happening here. The biofungicides study's results vs the commercial ones' results. So CoCoRes is the main class.

Is there another possible class? Let me see. Since the commercial applications used "similar applications," maybe CoCoGM is involved because methods are similar but goals differ? Not sure. Wait, CoCoGM is comparing goals or methods. If the method (application) is similar but results differ, maybe CoCoGM if they compared methods. But in this case, the user mentions "similar applications," meaning the methods are similar. So maybe CoCoGM is secondary? The example given for CoCoGM mentions contrasting methods. So here, the methods (applications) are similar, so maybe CoCoGM doesn't apply. Then the second could be Neutral? Or maybe Weakness? No, because there's no criticism. Hmm. Maybe Neutral isn't right. Perhaps the third could be Neutral, but I don't think so. Alternatively, maybe the comparison is solely CoCoRes. Maybe another class is Similar, but the results are contrasting. So perhaps the top is CoCoRes, then maybe CoCoXY if comparing explanations. But the example in CoCoXY involves comparing cited studies with each other, not with the citing paper. Wait, the example given here is contrasting the results of the citing paper with the cited work. Therefore, CoCoRes is the primary class. The other possible classes might be Basis (if the cited work is foundational, but that's not the case here) or Support (if they are supporting, but it's contrasting). So the top three might be CoCoRes, then maybe CoCoGM if methods are similar, then perhaps Neutral. Alternatively, maybe CoCoRes is first, then CoCoXY if contrasting claims between the cited work and the current paper, but the example for CoCoXY is when two cited studies are compared, not the current paper with a cited one. 

Wait, the example for CoCoRes is comparing the citing paper's results with the cited work's results. That's exactly this case. Therefore, CoCoRes is definitely first. Then, maybe CoCoGM isn't applicable. The second could be Neutral if the citation is used in a way that's just stating facts, but the contrast indicates a more active comparison. Hmm. Maybe the third is Neutral. Alternatively, maybe CoCoGM because the methods are similar, but the example given for CoCoGM is contrasting methods/goals. Since the application methods are similar, maybe CoCoGM is applicable. 

Alternatively, maybe the second is CoCoGM (comparing methods), third is Neutral. But I'm not sure. Given the ambiguity, the primary is CoCoRes, then maybe CoCoGM as secondary, then Neutral. So the final ranking would be:

1. CoCoRes  
2. CoCoGM  
3. Neutral

1. CoCoRes

3. Neutral
