Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. First, I need to identify the context around the citation marked @@CITATION@@. Let me start by reading the passage provided in the user's query.

The citation passage is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@."

Looking at the context, the authors are stating that their results differ from previous experiments that used deuterium-saturated metal targets. The citation is referencing those previous experiments. The main intent here seems to be a direct comparison between the present results and the cited work's findings. 

In the examples provided, CoCoRes is used when the paper directly compares results with the cited work. The example given is almost identical to the current case where results are said to differ from a cited study. So the primary rhetorical class here is likely CoCoRes.

Next, I need to determine if there are secondary classes. Let's look at the other options. The sentence doesn't mention supporting their findings (Support), nor is it a neutral description without specific argument (Neutral). There's no indication of contrasting goals or methods (CoCoGM) or comparing explanations (CoCoXY). The citation isn't used for motivation or future directions, nor is it pointing out weaknesses. So the only relevant ones are CoCoRes as primary.

Is there a secondary class? The example in CoCoRes explicitly shows a direct comparison of results. The user's sentence uses "substantially differ from," which is a clear result comparison. Since this is the most fitting class, and there's no other explicit comparison type mentioned, like CoCoXY where studies are compared with each other, not the citing paper. So CoCoXY doesn't apply here.

Therefore, the top class is CoCoRes. For the second and third positions, looking at the remaining options, maybe Basis? But the example for Basis refers to foundational research introducing a method, which isn't the case here. The cited work here is about experimental results being compared. Neutral might be third if the citation is just mentioned descriptively. But in the user's example, Neutral is when it's just stating a fact without argument. Here, stating a difference is an argumentative point, not neutral. Therefore, the next possible classes might be Support or Similar, but since they are stating differences, not support or similarity. Weakness could be considered if they're pointing out a flaw in the cited work. However, the sentence is about results differing, not stating the cited work's limitations. 

Wait, maybe Weakness isn't applicable here either. The cited work's results are different, but not necessarily flawed. The authors are just comparing their findings. Therefore, after CoCoRes, maybe Basis isn't fitting, and Neutral could be considered. Wait, in the example given for Neutral, it's stating a fact about when something was spreading without supporting an argument. In this case, the citation is used to contrast results, which is not Neutral. 

So after CoCoRes, perhaps there are no other applicable classes from the options provided. Wait, maybe CoCoGM? But the comparison here is about results, not goals or methods. The example of CoCoGM compares the method of a concurrent work. Here, the cited work's methods aren't mentioned; the authors are comparing results. Therefore, CoCoRes is the only clear class. However, according to the instructions, three classes are required. 

Looking back at the example given for CoCoRes: the citation is directly compared. Therefore, CoCoRes is 1. Neutral might be the next if the rest isn't applicable. Or perhaps there are two others. Wait, perhaps the sentence is not only comparing results but also establishing the cited work as a basis for comparison. Wait, but Basis is when the cited work is foundational to the current research. In this case, maybe Basis is second? For example, the cited work's results form the basis against which their current results are compared. But according to the example for Basis, it's about introducing a method or foundational work. If the cited study's results are a baseline, perhaps Basis is a lower priority. However, given the example for Basis involves validating a method, which isn't the case here. 

Alternatively, if the cited study's results are part of the existing body of knowledge that the current study contrasts against, maybe that forms a comparison of results (still CoCoRes). Since there's only one clear classification here, perhaps Neutral is third. Wait, Neutral could be third if part of the statement isn't part of the argument. For example, the phrase "conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets" might be descriptive. But the overall intent of the citation is to compare results. 

Given the constraints, I think the correct classifications here are:

1. CoCoRes (direct comparison of results)

Then, perhaps Neutral is second if part of the sentence is neutral. But according to the guidelines, Neutral is when the citation is descriptive without supporting, comparing, criticizing, etc. In this case, the citation is used to compare results, so Neutral isn't applicable. Then perhaps Weakness as third if there's an implied flaw, but it's just a difference in results. Without explicit criticism, Weakness isn't accurate.

Alternatively, maybe Basis is considered if the cited work's results form the basis of the comparison. But in the example for Basis, it's foundational. 

Therefore, perhaps only CoCoRes is the primary class, but the task requires three. However, the example provided in the user's instruction includes CoCoRes as first and then CoCoXY as second. Wait, no, in the user's example, CoCoXY is when comparing two cited studies with each other. Not applicable here. 

Maybe the remaining options are Neutral as second and perhaps CoCoGM or others as third. Given that the example isn't fitting for other classes, perhaps CoCoRes is the only valid, but the task requires three. Maybe Neutral is third if the rest can't be applied. Alternatively, if Neutral is not applicable, perhaps Weakness as third. Since the example's citation is neutral if it's just stating a fact without argument, but in this case, the intent is to contrast results. 

I think that after CoCoRes (first), there might not be a good fit for second and third. But according to the problem statement, three are required. Given that, maybe Neutral is the next if the sentence includes a neutral descriptive part. For example, mentioning the types of targets used could be neutral, but the act of comparing results is CoCoRes. However, I think combining these isn't allowed. Perhaps the best approach is to assign CoCoRes as first and then consider Neutral or Weakness. But given that, perhaps Neutral is not appropriate. 

Looking back at the user's instruction, the Neutral example says: "In the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 @@CITATION@@." Here, the citation is just stating a fact without supporting or comparing. In our case, the citation is part of a statement contrasting results, so Neutral isn't fitting. 

Therefore, perhaps after CoCoRes, Basis is considered? But the Basis example refers to foundational work. Maybe the cited study here is forming the basis for the comparison, but that's stretching it. 

In conclusion, perhaps the only valid class here is CoCoRes, but the task requires three. Therefore, maybe Weakness or Basis are considered as lower ranks, even if they don't perfectly fit. Given that, perhaps Weakness is third as the least appropriate if none others apply. Alternatively, Neutral. But according to the example given, Neutral is when the citation doesn't argue anything. 

This is challenging, but based on the provided examples, CoCoRes is the primary. For the second and third places, perhaps the only options left are Basis and Neutral, even though they may not fully fit. 

Alternatively, maybe Neutral is third because the mention of the deuterium saturated targets could be neutral. So the sentence says the experiments were conducted with those targets, which is a neutral statement. However, the act of saying their results differ from that study is CoCoRes. So maybe part of the citation is used for CoCoRes and part is Neutral. But according to the instructions, we should focus on the citation's intent in the passage. The citation's intent here is to compare results. Therefore, CoCoRes is the main one, and perhaps there's no other applicable classes. 

However, the task requires three classes. The best option might be CoCoRes as first, then maybe Basis as second if the cited work provides a foundation. But since the example for Basis is about introducing a method, perhaps here the cited work's results serve as a foundation for the comparison. But the example's definition for Basis is intellectual foundation. Given that, I'm unsure. Alternatively, if there are no other applicable classes, Neutral might be forced as third, even though it's not accurate. 

Given the constraints, I'll proceed with the primary three classes as CoCoRes, then perhaps Weakness if results differing imply a weakness, but that's a stretch. Alternatively, Neutral as third. Based on the example given by the user, Neutral is when the citation is just stating a fact. Here, it's about differences in results, which isn't Neutral. 

Therefore, the final list would be:

1. CoCoRes 
2. Basis (if forced) 
3. Neutral 

But since Basis isn't really fitting, perhaps Weakness could be third. But Weakness requires a critique. Maybe the authors are saying their results differ, which could imply that the previous results are not reliable, which might be Weakness. However, it could also be a neutral statement of difference. 

Given the ambiguity, maybe the correct top three are CoCoRes as primary, then possibly Weakness as second if there's implied critique, and Basis as third if forced. But I'm not confident here. 

Given the example in the user's instruction for Weakness where a study's taxonomic status is problematic, the cited work's results are in question. In our case, the authors are saying their results differ, which might indicate the cited study's results aren't completely accurate. Therefore, Weakness could be second. 

So possible ranking:

1. CoCoRes 
2. Weakness 
3. Basis 

But this is speculative. Alternatively, the user's example of CoCoRes is a straightforward comparison, so CoCoRes is first. The remaining two could be Neutral (since part of the sentence is descriptive) and Basis (as the cited work's results are a reference point). 

Given the confusion, I think the most accurate answer based on the example is CoCoRes as first. For the remaining two positions, since there's no better fit, perhaps Neutral and Basis. Hence:

1. CoCoRes  
2. Basis  
3. Neutral
