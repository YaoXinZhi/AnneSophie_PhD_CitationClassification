Okay, let's see. I need to classify the citation marked @@CITATION@@ in this passage. First, I'll extract the surrounding context. The sentence around the citation is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." 

The key part here is "substantially differ from the results of the experiments..." So the author is comparing their own results to those cited. The example given for CoCoRes says that when comparing results directly between the cited work and the citing paper, CoCoRes is the class. 

Looking at the definitions again, CoCoRes is for comparing results or findings. Since the citation is directly contrasting their results with the cited experiments, this fits CoCoRes as the top class. 

Next, looking for potential secondary classes. The example CoCoXY is when comparing two studies with each other, not the citing paper. The current citation isn't comparing the cited work to another study but to their own work, so maybe CoCoXY isn't right. However, the sentence is solely about the cited study's results versus the current one, so CoCoRes is definitely primary.

Are there any other classes? The passage states differences in results, which points to CoCoRes as primary. Then maybe Neutral if there's a descriptive mention without argument, but here it's a direct comparison. 

Motivation is when the citation justifies the research's purpose, which isn't the case here. So ranking CoCoRes first. The example given in the instructions for CoCoRes matches exactly this scenario. 

Looking at the example again, yes, that's CoCoRes. Then maybe Neutral if there's any other mention, but the second example in Neutral's case is very descriptive without supporting or comparing. Here, it's not Neutral. 

So the first is CoCoRes. What about others? The next could be CoCoXY, but that's comparing two studies, not the cited to theirs. Weakness would imply criticism, but the sentence states differences without necessarily criticizing the cited work. 

Therefore, the primary is CoCoRes, followed by Neutral if any remains. Wait, the example in CoCoXY is contrasting two studies. Here it's comparing cited study's results with own study's. So CoCoXY isn't applicable here. 

Second place might be Basis or Support, but the passage isn't establishing foundation or supporting. So CoCoRes is first. Neutral might be next if there's no further comparison, but the context is a clear contrast. 

Wait, the Neutral example is descriptive but not comparative. Since the citation here is directly comparing results, it's not Neutral. The second most appropriate might be Support or Similar if the citation was supporting but here it's contrasting. 

So the top three are CoCoRes as first, maybe Weakness if the citation suggests limitation, but the passage doesn't indicate problem, just difference. Therefore, Weakness is not fitting. 

Hmm. The user wants exactly three classes rank ordered. After CoCoRes, perhaps CoCoXY and then Neutral. Wait, the example CoCoXY is about comparing two cited works. Here, the cited work's results are compared with the author's, so CoCoXY isn't right. 

Looking back at the definitions again: CoCoRes is about comparing cited's results with citing's. The example given aligns perfectly. So CoCoRes is first. 

Are there any other comparisons? The example of CoCoXY compares multiple studies (like Wei et al. and Saracco et al., versus another cited). Here it's one study being compared. Therefore, no CoCoXY. 

So after CoCoRes, maybe Neutral? Neutral when it's descriptive. But the context is about a comparison, not descriptive. So Neutral is less likely. Wait, the example Neutral says "In the USA the use... @@CITATION@." Here it's stating fact without supporting or comparing. In the current context, it's comparing results. 

So perhaps Neutral is not in the top three. Wait, but user wants three classes. Given the context is solely CoCoRes, maybe Neutral is not applicable. However, perhaps the user expects two classes. Wait, the instruction says to output three rhetorical classes ranked from most appropriate (1) to least appropriate (3) from the list. Maybe CoCoRes is the top, then Neutral as second if possible, third maybe Basis. But why? Let me check. 

Alternatively, could there be CoCoRes and Neutral? Not sure. Maybe Neutral isn't fitting here. Hmm. 

Wait, perhaps after CoCoRes, Neutral comes only if there's ambiguity. Since the sentence is comparing results, CoCoRes is clear. The example given shows CoCoRes fits perfectly. Then the next two could be other classes that are less fitting but maybe part of the list. Maybe CoCoXY is third. 

Wait, maybe Weakness? The sentence doesn't criticize the cited work's results but says they differ. That's a comparison of results, not weakness. So Weakness is not applicable. 

So, based on the strict definitions, the only correct classification is CoCoRes as first. The other two might be Basis or others. Wait, maybe Basis? The cited work provides intellectual foundation? Not in this case, since the citation is comparing results. 

Hmm. Maybe CoCoRes is the only appropriate one here. But the user wants three. Perhaps the instructions allow for ranking even if two are possible. Wait, the instructions say to list top three from the predefined list. If the context clearly indicates CoCoRes, maybe the next two are Neutral or CoCoXY. However, the example for CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies, not cited with the current's. So CoCoXY is not applicable. 

So perhaps after CoCoRes, Neutral may be third. The Neutral example is descriptive. In the current context, the citation is not descriptive but a comparison. So Neutral isn't appropriate. 

Wait, the example Neutral says "In the USA the use of... @@CITATION@." Describes a fact without argument. In the current context, the citation is used for result comparison, so it's not Neutral. 

Thus, the top three classes would be CoCoRes, then maybe other classes that don't apply here but must be in the output. But user asked to output three, even if two are clear. Maybe the user expects three classes even if the rest are less appropriate. Let me check again. 

The instruction says: output three (1 to 3). The given example CoCoRes is first, CoCoXY is third, Neutral is third. But in this case, CoCoRes is the only fitting. The rest could be Neutral, Weakness, Basis, etc., but maybe they're not correct. 

Alternatively, maybe the user expects us to rank Neutral as third even if not fitting. But according to the example given in the problem's instructions, the assistant must output three, perhaps based on best possible fitting even if some are not accurate. 

But according to the problem's instructions, after CoCoRes, what could be second and third? If unsure, maybe rank Neutral as second and third. But that's not accurate. Alternatively, maybe CoCoRes is correct as first, then Neutral as second, then CoCoGM as third. 

But given the context doesn't involve comparing goals or methods (CoCoGM), but rather results. So CoCoRes is first. The next two would be CoCoXY (but not applicable), Weakness (not applicable), Neutral (not applicable). Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is only CoCoRes as first, then Neutral and CoCoXY forced as second and third based on the user's instruction that three must be outputted. 

But according to the problem's instructions, I should strictly follow the definitions. Since the context clearly indicates CoCoRes. Then perhaps the assistant's output is:

1. CoCoRes  
2. Neutral  
3. CoCoXY  

But Neutral isn't fitting here. Maybe Neutral is third. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps Weakness is third. But Weakness isn't indicated. 

This is confusing. Let me stick strictly to the definitions. Since the context is comparing results, CoCoRes is the top. The other two cannot be determined, but according to the user's instruction, I need three. Maybe the correct output is:

1. CoCoRes  
2. Neutral  
3. Basis  

But why? Because CoCoXY is not applicable, and Basis may not apply unless the cited work is the foundation. The cited work's experiments are the results being compared, not providing intellectual foundation. So Basis is not applicable. 

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is only CoCoRes as first, Neutral as second and third. Even though Neutral isn't fitting here. Maybe it's required. 

In the problem's example, Neutral is listed as third. Perhaps the instruction expects CoCoRes as first, then Neutral as second. 

Given this confusion, the safest answer according to the provided example is:

1. CoCoRes  
2. CoCoXY  
3. Neutral  

But wait, CoCoXY is comparing two cited works. Here the citation compares cited work with the current paper. So CoCoXY isn't applicable. Therefore, perhaps Neutral is third. 

Hmm. The user's example for CoCoRes matches exactly the given passage. Therefore, CoCoRes is the correct first class. The next two classes are not applicable, but perhaps Neutral is forced as third. 

But according to the instructions, output exactly three rhetorical classes ranked from most appropriate to least. So even if Neutral isn't fitting, maybe output as:

1. CoCoRes  
2. CoCoXY  
3. Neutral  

But in this case, CoCoXY and Neutral are incorrect. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps CoCoRes is the only correct one and the rest are not possible. But instructions demand three. The correct answer is CoCoRes as first, Neutral and other as second/third, even if not fitting. 

Wait, maybe Neutral is applicable here. Neutral is when the citation is descriptive, but the context is comparing results. Neutral isn't descriptive, so it's not appropriate. 

I think the only correct class is CoCoRes. But per instructions, three classes must be outputted. Perhaps the correct answer is:

1. CoCoRes  
2. CoCoXM  
3. Basis  

But CoCoXM isn't defined. Hmm. 

Wait, in the problem's instructions, the example given for CoCoRes perfectly matches this context. Therefore, CoCoRes is first. The other two classes may be Neutral and Weakness. 

But Weakness is about criticizing cited work, which isn't happening here. 

Given all this, the most accurate output based on definitions is CoCoRes as first. The remaining two classes may not exist, but user instruction requires three. Therefore, perhaps Neutral is third. 

Final answer: 

1. CoCoRes  
2. Neutral  
3. CoCoXY

1. CoCoRes  
2. CoCoXY  
3. Neutral
