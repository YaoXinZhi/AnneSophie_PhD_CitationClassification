Okay, let's start by looking at the given passage and the citation tagged @@CITATION@@. The sentence around the citation says: "The effectiveness of this treatment was later supported by @@CITATION@@, who found similar results using a larger sample size in a controlled trial." 

First, I'll extract the context that's relevant to the citation. The key part here is that the current authors mention their treatment's effectiveness was supported by the cited work, and the cited study found similar results with a larger sample in a controlled trial. 

Next, identifying the general intent. The phrase "was later supported by" suggests that the citation is used to back up the current research's claims. Also, "found similar results" indicates a comparison in findings between the current work and the cited paper. However, since the citation is presented as supporting their results, this leans towards the Support category.

Looking at the specific rhetorical classes, Support is the primary fit here because the cited work confirms their findings. Then, Similarity is also relevant because the results are similar. However, there isn't a direct comparison contrasting methods or goals, so CoCoGM or CoCoRes might not apply. The citation isn't criticizing or pointing out weaknesses, so Weakness is out. There's no mention of future work or motivation here either. 

The ranking would be Support as the top class since the citation's main role is to support the authors' claims. Similar comes next because the cited results are similar. Neutral is perhaps the third since the citation is described factually without expressing critical or motivational intent beyond support.
