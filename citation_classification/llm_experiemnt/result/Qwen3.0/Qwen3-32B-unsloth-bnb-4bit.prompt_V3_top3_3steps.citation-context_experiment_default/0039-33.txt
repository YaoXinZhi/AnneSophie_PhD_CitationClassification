Okay, let's tackle this classification task step by step.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation marked @@CITATION@@ in the provided passage. The passage says: "Similarly, a small aphid gut binding peptide was shown to interfere with enamovirus uptake from pea aphid gut into the hemocoel; the peptide also bound to gut epithelia of two other aphid species suggesting potential broader applicability @@CITATION@@." 

So the context here is about a study that found a peptide interfering with virus uptake and indicating possible broader use in other aphid species.

Next, identify the general intent of the citation. The phrase "suggesting potential broader applicability" implies that the cited work is pointing towards future research opportunities or possible applications beyond the current study. That leans towards the "Future" category. 

Looking at the rhetorical classes, "Future" would be the primary because it's about future research directions. "Support" might come into play if they're using the citation to back up their own findings, but the wording here is more about future implications rather than supporting existing claims. "Similar" could be a third option if they're drawing parallels, but the main thrust is the suggestion of broader applications.

So the top three classes would likely be Future, then perhaps Similar (since the cited work's findings are being highlighted as similar in the context), and maybe Support if there's an implied backing of a concept. But given the example provided for Future matches the cited study's role in suggesting applicability, Future is definitely first. The mention of similarity between species might be Similar, but the main intent is future research direction. Neutral could be tricky here, but the citation isn't just stating facts, it's suggesting implications. 

Thus, the top three are Future (1), then Similar (since other studies found similar patterns), and CoCoXY if comparing explanations, but in this case, the cited work is being compared to others in terms of results (CoCoRes) isn't directly matching. Looking back at the examples, CoCoRes involves comparing results between the citing paper and cited work, but here it's about suggesting future applications based on the cited result. So after Future, maybe Similar is second, Neutral third. Wait, Neutral is when it's just descriptive. The sentence isn't really neutralâ€”it's pointing to broader implications. So perhaps Future is first, Similar is second because the cited study's result is similar in suggesting broader applicability, and maybe Basis isn't applicable here. Basis is about foundational work, which isn't the case here. CoCoGM is about comparing goals or methods, which isn't directly happening. CoCoXY is comparing cited studies themselves, but the example here mentions another study's conflicting results. Wait, the given example for CoCoXY has conflicting results described between two studies, whereas here the context is suggesting similarity (the peptide's effect in other species). So CoCoRes might be relevant if comparing results between citing and cited work, but the cited work's result is being used to infer broader applicability. Hmm. Alternatively, Support could be if supporting the claim of broader applicability, but the cited work is the one making the claim. Wait, the citing paper mentions that the peptide "also bound to gut epithelia of two other aphid species suggesting potential broader applicability." The citation is the study that showed this binding in the two species. So the current study is pointing out the broader applicability inferred from the cited study's findings. That suggests Future is the primary class here because they're indicating future research could explore that applicability. Support might be if they're using the cited study to back up their inference. But in this case, the cited study's own findings are supporting the suggestion. Wait, maybe Support is appropriate because the current study is using the cited work's findings to support the claim of broader applicability. Or is the citation being used to support the claim of broader applicability made by the citing paper? Let me re-read the example for Support. The example says the subscales were consistent with previous research, supporting the citing authors' findings. In this case, the cited study's findings are the basis for the suggestion made by the citing paper. So maybe Support is the class here. Wait, but the cited study's peptide binding to other species supports the suggestion of broader applicability. So the citation is supporting the claim made by the citing paper. Let me check the Support example again. The example says "participants did not distinguish between personal interests... as before" because of the cited study. So in this case, the cited study is supporting a current subscale consistency. Similarly, here, the cited study supports the suggestion of broader applicability by showing binding in other species. Therefore, Support might be the primary rhetorical class. Hmm. Conflict arises between Support and Future. 

Wait, the citation is part of the phrase that says the peptide bound to two other species, suggesting broader applicability. The Future class's example says "suggesting potential broader applicability" is cited, hence indicating future directions. In the given example, the citation is used to suggest future applications. So in this case, the Future class is appropriate because the citation is being used to point towards future research directions. Support would be if the cited study supports a finding in the current paper, but here the current paper is suggesting future directions based on the cited study's results. Therefore, Future is the primary rhetorical class. Then, Support might come in if the cited study's results are supporting the suggestion, but in this case, the cited study itself shows the results that lead to the suggestion. So Support might not be the right class here. Neutral is when it's just stated factually, which isn't the case here. The third class could be Similar if the cited study's results are similar to something else mentioned, but the cited study's own findings are leading to the broader applicability suggestion. Maybe CoCoRes isn't applicable here since the citation isn't comparing results with the citing paper but is about suggesting future directions. Hmm. 

Alternatively, considering the structure of the sentence: the cited study's finding (peptide bound to two other species) is presented, then the suggestion follows. This is similar to the Future example where the citation is used to suggest directions. Therefore, Future is correct. Then, maybe Similar is second if the cited study's findings are similar to others, but CoCoXY could be if comparing explanations between studies, but CoCoXY's example mentions conflicting results between two cited studies. In this case, the cited study alone is mentioned with findings leading to broader applicability. Perhaps Support is the second class if the cited study supports the suggestion. Wait, maybe Support is appropriate here. Let me check again. The Support example: "All subscales... as before... participants did not distinguish... also using a U.S. sample." Here, the cited study supports the current subscales' consistency. Similarly, here, the cited study supports the suggestion of broader applicability by showing similar effects in other species. So Support could be the primary class. However, the Future example also fits because the citation is part of suggesting future research directions. But according to the definition, Future is when the citation is used to suggest directions. The example says "suggesting potential broader applicability" is cited, hence Future. Therefore, Future is the primary class. Then, Support might be secondary because the cited study's results support the citing paper's suggestion, but it's not entirely clear. Another angle: Similar could be the second if the cited study's results are similar to the current findings, leading to the suggestion of broader applicability. 

Given the ambiguity, perhaps the top three are Future, Support, and Similar, based on the examples provided. However, after careful analysis, Future is the strongest fit for the main intent, followed by Support and then Similar. But I need to prioritize based on the example given. The example provided for Future exactly matches the context here, where the citation is used to point towards future applicability. Therefore, Future is the primary rhetorical class. Support might be secondary if the cited work supports the current conclusion. Let me go back to the Support definition: Support is when the citation is used to support the work, result, or finding of the citing authors. Here, the citing authors suggest broader applicability based on the cited study's findings. So the cited study supports the suggestion. Hence, Support would be appropriate as the second class. Neutral is third if it's just stating facts, but in this case, they're using it to support or suggest future directions. Neutral would not fit here. 

Therefore, the top three classes are: Future, Support, and then perhaps Similar or CoCoRes. Wait, CoCoRes is for directly comparing results between the citing paper and the cited work. If the citing paper's findings differ or are similar to the cited work's results, CoCoRes applies. In this case, the citing paper's suggestion is not comparing results but using the cited result to make a point. Therefore, CoCoRes isn't applicable here. Then, Similar could fit if the cited study's results are similar to others or to the citing study's results. Since here the cited study's findings are similar to others (as per the two aphid species), Similar could be second. But the primary intent is Future. So final order would be Future (1), Support (2), Similar (3). But based on the example given for Support, maybe Support isn't fitting here. Alternatively, maybe the cited work's findings are being used to support the suggestion of broader applicability, which aligns with Support. Hence, Support is second. The example given for Future is a perfect match. After thorough consideration, I'll proceed with Future as 1, Support as 2, and then perhaps Neutral as 3 if none apply, but in this case, Neutral isn't a fit. The correct order based on the definitions provided would be Future, Support, Similar. Wait, Neutral might not be applicable here. Alternatively, after Future and Support, maybe CoCoGM or CoCoRes. Since the cited study's findings are showing peptide binding, which is similar to what others have found, maybe Similar is third. 

After reviewing all classes and examples, the most accurate classification based on the given context is Future as primary, Support as secondary, and Similar as third.
