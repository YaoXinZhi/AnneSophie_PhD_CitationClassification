Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the rhetorical classes for this citation. The passage is about plant health, mentioning a study by @@CITATION@@ on the effects of phytoplasma in daisies. 

First step is extracting the context around the citation. The sentence says, "Fast multiplication rates and high concentration of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains have been reported in young developing leaves and roots of infected daisy plants (Wei et al., 2004; Saracco et al., 2006), although conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima @@CITATION@@."

So the citation is pointing out conflicting results in another study about a different plant species. The authors are comparing the results of their mentioned studies with the cited one. 

General intent here seems to highlight differing findings between the cited work and another study. The example given for CoCoXY involves comparing two cited studies, not the current work. That fits because the sentence here is contrasting results between Wei/Saracco's findings and the cited @CITATION's, both about phytoplasma, but in different plant contexts. 

Next, ranking the classes. CoCoXY is primary since it's comparing cited works. Then maybe CoCoRes since there's a comparison of results, but the example for CoCoRes is about comparing cited work with the current paper, whereas here it's comparing cited works with each other. So CoCoXY is more accurate. 

The third might be Neutral if there's no supporting argument, but the citation is directly contrasting results, so maybe Weakness if it's criticizing the cited study? Wait, the example for Weakness critiques the cited work as problematic, but here it's about conflicting results without necessarily criticizing the cited work's validity. Neutral could be possible if it's just reporting conflicting results without judgment. 

So top three: CoCoXY first, Neutral second since it's describing conflicting results in a neutral way, and maybe Weakness if they're pointing out a flaw, but maybe not. Alternatively, if conflicting is neutral, Neutral would be second. Future doesn't fit here. So final answer is CoCoXY, Neutral, and maybe CoCoRes? Wait, CoCoRes is when comparing the cited work's results to the current paper. Here it's between two cited studies. So CoCoXY is correct. Neutral comes next because they mention conflicting results without clear support or criticism. The third could be CoCoRes if results comparison is implied between cited studies, but the class CoCoRes is when comparing cited and citing. So Neutral is better third. So ranking 1. CoCoXY, 2. Neutral, 3. Maybe CoCoRes or Weakness? Hmm, Weakness would involve criticizing the cited work, but the passage just states conflicting results. So Neutral is third.
