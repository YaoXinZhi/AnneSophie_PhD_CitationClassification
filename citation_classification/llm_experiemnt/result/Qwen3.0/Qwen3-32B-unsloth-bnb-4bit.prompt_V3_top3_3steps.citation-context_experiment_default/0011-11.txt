OK, let's take it step by step. 

First, I need to look at the citation passage provided. The user has marked the citation as @@CITATION@@. The sentence around it is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@."

Step 1 is to extract the context discussing the citation. The key part here is that the authors are comparing their own results ("present work") with the results from experiments mentioned in the cited work (TiD, TaD, etc.).

Next, identify the general intent. The phrase "substantially differ from the results" suggests a comparison between the current findings and those of the cited work. This falls under Comparative intent, which maps to rhetorical classes like CoCoRes or CoCoXY. 

Looking at the definitions, CoCoRes is when the citation is used to compare or contrast the results or findings of the cited work with the current paper. The example given is exactly about comparing results. Here, the present work's results differ from those in the cited work, so CoCoRes is definitely applicable.

Is there another possible class here? The example for CoCoXY compares two studies cited with each other, not the cited study with the current paper. Since this sentence compares the current paper's results to the cited paper's results, CoCoRes is more accurate.

Are there any support or other classes? The sentence isn't supporting the current findings, nor is it pointing out similarities (which would be Similar). It's directly contrasting results, so CoCoRes is primary. 

Now, what's the third? Maybe Neutral or something else? Neutral is when the citation is used descriptively without argument. But here, the contrast is explicit, so Neutral isn't fit. The next possible could be Basis if they're foundational, but the context here is about comparing findings, not establishing foundational work. 

Is there motivation? No, the citation here isn't justifying why they did the research but comparing results. 

So top three would be CoCoRes first. Then perhaps CoCoXY if there's another study mentioned, but the cited works are TiD, TaD, etc., so maybe Neutral? Wait, the example of Neutral is something like stating facts without specific argument. However, in this case, it's explicitly contrasting results, so Neutral wouldn't be relevant. 

Wait, maybe Basis if the cited work provides foundation. No, it's rather that the cited work's results are different. So Basis might not apply. 

Looking at the example given for CoCoRes, it's exactly matching this scenario. Then the next classes might be Basis or Weakness? No, maybe Weakness? If the citation is pointing out weaknesses, but the sentence states the results differ, not that the cited work is flawed. So Weakness might not be correct. 

Therefore, CoCoRes is the primary class. Next possible could be Neutral if no other applies. Alternatively, perhaps similar isn't right. Wait, maybe Basis if their own work is building on previous results. But the contrast is more indicative of CoCoRes. 

So top three would be CoCoRes as first, then maybe Basis if there's any foundation. Alternatively, maybe Motivation if they're contrasting results as a motivation. No, Motivation would be about why the research was conducted, not contrasting results. 

Wait, maybe Neutral as descriptive use. But Neutral example is like stating facts without argument, so in this case, the citation is contrasting results, so not Neutral. 

Thus, the top classes are CoCoRes as primary. Then perhaps Neutral as the next, but maybe there's no second class in this case. Wait, the example given by the user for CoCoRes is almost identical to this one. So CoCoRes is definitely first. The third could be Neutral or another class, but maybe Neutral isn't applicable here. Alternatively, maybe Weakness? Since the current results differ substantially, does that imply Weakness of cited work? But the example for Weakness says it's criticizing or questioning the cited work's limitations. In the given sentence, it's stating that present results differ, not necessarily that cited work is flawed. 

So third might be Neutral or something else. Hmm. Alternatively, Basis if the cited work is foundational but the context is comparing results. 

After reviewing, the best three seem to be CoCoRes first, maybe Neutral or CoCoXY as second. Wait, CoCoXY compares two cited studies with each other, not with the current paper. Since in this sentence the cited work is compared to the current paper, CoCoRes is correct. So perhaps second is Basis or another? If there's nothing else, maybe Neutral as third? But maybe Neutral isn't applicable here. Alternatively, if there's no better fit, third could be Basis. Wait, Basis is when it's the foundation. The citation here isn't establishing foundation but comparing results. 

Hmm. Maybe the top three are CoCoRes, then Neutral, then Basis? But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, CoCoRes is first, then maybe nothing else fits. 

In the user's example for CoCoRes, the cited work's results are directly compared with the present work. This sentence is the same scenario. Therefore, CoCoRes is the primary class. 

But what about CoCoXY? The example given for CoCoXY is comparing two studies cited with each other. In the given case, there's only one cited work compared to the current. So CoCoXY isn't applicable. 

Thus, the top three should be CoCoRes first, maybe Basis second if there's any foundation reference. Since in the example provided, the cited work provides the foundation for replication, but in this case, the cited work's results differ, so maybe Basis isn't relevant. 

Alternatively, maybe Future or something else isn't applicable. Given the constraints, the top three are CoCoRes, maybe nothing else, but the user requires three classes. Maybe Neutral is the third? Wait, Neutral is when citation is used descriptively, like stating facts. In this scenario, they're contrasting results. Hmm. 

Wait, perhaps Weakness is third. If they state their results differ substantially from previous, maybe implying weakness in previous methods. But Weakness requires criticism of cited work. 

In this case, the cited work's results are different but the statement doesn't criticize them. So maybe Weakness isn't right. 

Therefore, the top three are CoCoRes as first. The second and third could be Basis, Neutral, or CoCoXY, but perhaps Neutral is second, Basis third. But I'm uncertain. Since Neutral is descriptive without argument, which doesn't fit here. 

Alternatively, maybe Neutral isn't suitable. After careful analysis, CoCoRes is first. Then maybe CoCoXY and then Neutral. But CoCoXY isn't valid. Therefore, perhaps the user requires three classes even if only two fit. Alternatively, maybe Basis and Neutral are less relevant. 

Wait, perhaps Basis isn't applicable here. Since Basis is when it's the intellectual foundation. 

After checking, the most accurate class is CoCoRes as first. The second might be Weakness or another, but since the text states results differ substantially without criticism, Weakness doesn't fit. Therefore, perhaps the second could be Basis or Neutral but not applicable. Given the strict requirement of three classes, maybe CoCoRes is the first, Neutral the second, and Basis the third even if it's a stretch. But since Neutral doesn't fit, perhaps Basis and CoCoGM. CoCoGM is comparison of Goals or Methods. Since the comparison here is results, maybe CoCoGM isn't correct. 

This is challenging. Ultimately, given the example provided, CoCoRes is clearly applicable as first. Second and third might be Basis, Neutral, or Weakness, but none fit perfectly. Given that, perhaps CoCoRes is the only relevant class and the other two could be Basis and Neutral, even if they aren't the best fit. Maybe the user expects three classes even if secondary ones are weaker.
