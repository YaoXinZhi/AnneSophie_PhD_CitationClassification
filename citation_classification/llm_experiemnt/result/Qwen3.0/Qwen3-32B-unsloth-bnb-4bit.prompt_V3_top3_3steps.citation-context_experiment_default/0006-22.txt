Okay, let's tackle this. First, I need to look at the given passage and find where the citation is mentioned. The task is to determine the top three rhetorical classes for that citation.

The passage says, "The occurrence of the disease was also confirmed in samples collected from the same locality by @@CITATION@@ in 2023. These findings corroborate earlier reports of the species distribution in the region, suggesting a potential expansion of its range." 

Step 1: Extract the context. The sentence refers to the 2023 study confirming the disease in the same locality. The citing authors mention that their findings corroborate earlier reports, indicating expansion. 

Step 2: General intent. The citation here is to corroborate or support their own findings. They're confirming that another study (the citation) also found the disease in the same locality, supporting the current results. So, the intent is supportive, maybe also pointing out similarity since they mention corroboration. 

Step 3: Assign classes. The primary is Support because they're using the citation to back their findings. Next, Similar, because they're showing that their observations align with the cited work regarding the species distribution. Lastly, Basis might be secondary as well, but Basis is more about the intellectual foundation, which isn't the case here. Alternatively, Neutral could come in if the citation is just stated as a fact without supporting. But the main terms here like "corroborate" suggest Support and Similar. Future or Motivation don't fit. So top three would be Support, Similar, Neutral maybe third.

1. Support  
2. Similar  
3. Neutral
