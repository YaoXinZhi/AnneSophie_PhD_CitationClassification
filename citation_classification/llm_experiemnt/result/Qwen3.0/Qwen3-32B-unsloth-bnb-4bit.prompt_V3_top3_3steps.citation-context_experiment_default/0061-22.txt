Okay, let's start with the given passage and the citation marked @@CITATION@@. I need to figure out the rhetorical classes for that citation.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The sentence is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." 

The key part here is comparing the results of the current work with those from the cited experiments. The phrase "substantially differ" indicates that they're contrasting their findings with the cited ones. From the examples provided, CoCoRes is meant for direct comparison of results between the current paper and the cited work. 

Looking at the definitions, CoCoRes is when the citation is used to directly compare or contrast results. This fits because the authors are stating they differ from previous results. 

Next, are there other possible classes? Basis doesn't seem right because it's not about the foundation of the research. CoCoGM is about comparing goals or methods, but the sentence is about results. Motivation might be if the citation is setting a need, but here it's about existing results. Support or Similar might be if they agree, but they differ. Weakness could be if criticizing the cited work, but the example here is a neutral comparison of results. Neutral is when there's no strong stance, but since they are actively contrasting, it's not Neutral. 

Top choices would be CoCoRes first. What about second? Maybe Neutral if they're just stating existing findings, but the direct comparison pushes CoCoRes higher. Then perhaps Basis is not applicable here. Alternatively, CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies, but here it's comparing the current work to a cited one, so CoCoRes is correct. The third could be Neutral, as they mention the existence of past results without endorsing them. But the main intent is comparison of results. So the top three would be CoCoRes, then maybe Basis as the cited work provides a basis for comparison, but in the example given for Basis, it's about intellectual foundation, which may not fit. Alternatively, Neutral might come in third as the citation is providing context without direct criticism or support beyond comparing results. 

So the final three would be CoCoRes (1), maybe Neutral (2), and then Basis (3) if any, but Basis seems less fitting. Alternatively, perhaps CoCoRes, Basis isn't applicable, so Neutral could be third. Wait, maybe the cited work's results are part of the intellectual foundation, so Basis might be appropriate. Hmm. But the example for Basis involves foundational work that the current study replicates. Here it's a contrast, so maybe Basis isn't right. 

So the top three are CoCoRes (1), Neutral (2), and perhaps Future isn't relevant. Wait, the citation isn't suggesting future work. So the top three are CoCoRes, then maybe Neutral, then maybe Support isn't fitting. But the direct comparison is CoCoRes, and perhaps Neutral as third because there's a neutral mention of the cited experiment's existence. Alternatively, if there's another class that fits. But given the options, CoCoRes is first, perhapsNeutral as second, and maybe no other class fits. 

Wait, looking at the example of CoCoRes: the example given is identical in structure. So the correct classification here is CoCoRes first. Then, maybe Neutral as second, and Basis isn't applicable. Wait, the example in CoCoRes is direct comparison of results. So third could be other classes like Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoXY, Motivation, etc., but none seem to fit. So maybe the top three are CoCoRes, Neutral, and another class not clearly fitting. Since the example has CoCoRes as first and Neutral third, maybe Neutral comes in third here. Alternatively, CoCoRes is first, then nothing else fits well. Hmm. Since the user asks for three, maybe CoCoRes is first, then Neutral is third, and another class like Basis is second, but that doesn't seem right. I think based on the strict example provided, CoCoRes is first. Second could be Basis if the cited work provides foundation for comparison, but in this case, the citation is contrasting results, not foundation. So maybe the top three are CoCoRes, then Neutral, then maybe Weakness or Support, but neither fits. Alternatively, maybe CoCoXY isn't relevant here. So the top three are CoCoRes first, Neutral second, and then Neutral isn't applicable again. Wait, Neutral only appears once. Maybe Basis isn't fitting. Hmm. Given the example, CoCoRes is definitely first. What about CoCoXY? That's comparing two other cited sources. Here, the cited work is being compared to the current work, so CoCoRes applies. So the top three are CoCoRes as first, maybe Neutral as second, but Neutral is a possible class when the citation is descriptive. Since the current work states their results differ from cited results, the citation isn't Neutral. Alternatively, maybe CoCoRes is the only one fitting. The task says to list three, so perhaps the top one is CoCoRes, then Neutral (as there's no other class), and CoCoGM as third if that's the remaining option. But that's speculation. Based on the given definitions and examples, CoCoRes is the clear first. The others may not fit. Maybe Neutral is third due to the cited work being mentioned neutrally as part of the comparison. I'll go with CoCoRes as first, Neutral as second, and CoCoXY as third, but CoCoXY is comparing two studies not the current work. Hmm, perhaps CoCoXY isn't right here. So, after reconsideration, perhaps only CoCoRes is accurate, but the task requires three. Alternatively, maybe Basis is mistakenly applied here. Given the ambiguity, the best response based on the example is CoCoRes.
