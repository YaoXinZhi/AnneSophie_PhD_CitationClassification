Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to look at the context where the citation is placed. The example given uses CoCoRes, which is about comparing results. So if the citation in the user's passage is showing that their results are different from another study, that's CoCoRes. Then check if there's a comparison between two cited studies without involving the current paper, which would be CoCoXY. And Neutral would be if the citation is just stating facts without supporting or comparing.

Looking at the example passage, they say their results differ from experiments using deuterium saturated metal targets cited by @@CITATION@@. That's a direct comparison of results, so CoCoRes is the primary. CoCoXY might be if they're comparing two other studies. Neutral would be if they're just mentioning the study's findings without contrasting. In the example provided, Neutral is third because it's a direct result comparison, then maybe Neutral if there's no other intent beyond that. Wait, maybe after CoCoRes, Neutral makes sense as a fallback if there's no other specific context. Yeah, the example's top is CoCoRes, then CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two studies, but Neutral if not. So the correct ranking is CoCoRes first, CoCoXY if present, Neutral as third.
