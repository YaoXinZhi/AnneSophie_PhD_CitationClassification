Okay, let's tackle this classification task step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. The passage mentions that @@CITATION@@ used a specific method to study plant stress responses. The authors then state that their current work builds upon these findings by employing a different experimental setup.

Moving to step two, I need to determine the general intent behind the citation. Since the citation is discussed as the foundation for the current research, citing the original study which validated the method they are building upon, it seems foundational. The example for 'Basis' involves introducing an intellectual foundation, so this fits.

Next, for step three, identifying the top three rhetorical classes. The primary class here is definitely 'Basis' as the citation provides the foundational work. Then, looking for comparative elements. The authors mention using a different setup, which suggests a comparison of methods (CoCoGM). Lastly, there's a neutral mention since the authors state they are building upon the previous work without further comparison or support. So 'Neutral' would be third. There's no direct support or motivation here. The 'Usage' isn't applicable since they don't directly use a method from the cited work but build upon it. Critical/Weakness isn't present either. So the top three are Basis, CoCoGM, and Neutral.

1. Basis  
2. CoCoGM  
3. Neutral
