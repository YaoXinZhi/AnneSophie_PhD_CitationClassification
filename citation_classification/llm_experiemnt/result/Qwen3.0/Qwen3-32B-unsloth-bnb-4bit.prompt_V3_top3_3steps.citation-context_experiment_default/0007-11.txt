Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the @@CITATION@@. Let me read the passage again to get the right context.

The citation is part of a sentence that says: "The results obtained in these studies, along with those reported in @@CITATION@@", are similar to..." So the key part here is comparing the results from their research ("these studies") with another study's results mentioned in the citation. 

Next, determining the general intent. Comparing results between the current work and the cited work seems to be the main goal here. Looking at the definitions, CoCoRes is for comparing results. That's likely the primary class. 

But wait, the example given for CoCoRes mentions direct comparison of results. Here, the sentence states that their results are similar to those reported in the citation. So this is a comparison of findings, which fits CoCoRes. 

Then the rest. The next possible classes could be Similar, since they are highlighting similarity, but Similar is another category. The definition says Similar is when they point out similarity between cited work and the citing paper. However, in this case, the citing paper's results are similar to the cited work's results. So Similar might still apply here. 

But according to the example of Similar: "Our finding... is supported by... [citation]." That's more support. Wait, but the example for Similar is when they show similarity in results, patterns, etc. Here, the sentence structure is similar to the example given in Support except the example uses "supported by". However, the cited work's results are mentioned as being similar to their own results, which could be Support if they are using the cited work to support their findings. 

Wait, maybe that's conflicting. Let's clarify. CoCoRes is a direct comparison of results between the citing paper and the cited work. The example under CoCoRes is "results ... substantially differ from..." which is a contrast. In the given passage, the results are "similar to those reported in [citation]" which is a comparison of similarity. So this would still fall under CoCoRes because it's comparing results. 

The Similar category is when the papers point out similarities between their own work and the cited work. The example given for Similar mentions results in their study are similar to cited work. However, Similar might be part of CoCoRes here. Wait, maybe there's overlap. Let's check definitions again. 

CoCoRes is direct comparison of results between citing and cited work. Similar is pointing out that cited work's findings are similar to the current paper's findings. In the example for CoCoRes, it's differing results, but the example here is similar results. So CoCoRes includes both similar and different results comparisons. Hence, this would be CoCoRes. 

Then, if they mention similarity, would that be both CoCoRes and Similar? Maybe. But according to the step where we have to rank top three rhetorical classes, maybe CoCoRes is primary, then Similar as secondary if applicable. Wait, the options are separate. Let me check the predefined classes again. 

The classes are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Motivation, Future, Support, Similar, Usage, Weakness, Neutral. 

In the given example for Similar, the citing paper's findings are similar to cited. Here, the sentence says "results ... reported in citation are similar to our results." Wait, the structure is different than the example given. So the cited work's results are similar to their own, hence the similarity is mutual. So in the citation's case, the cited work's results are part of the similar findings. 

The Similar class example uses "supported by recent cross-taxon investigations... [citation]". Here, the cited work is mentioned as having similar results, so Similar is applicable. However, CoCoRes is the category for comparing results between cited and current work. 

In definitions, CoCoRes is direct comparison of results. So CoCoRes is for comparing two works' results. Since the cited work's results are being compared to the current work's results (even if it's a similarity), CoCoRes would be the primary class. 

Then, Support could be considered if they use the cited work to support their claims. However, Support is when the citation supports the current work's findings, which is what Similar does. Wait, Support is for when the cited work supports the citing authors' work. The example under Support is "All subscales were consistent with previous research, particularly that of [citation]". So if the citation supports their findings, then Support applies. 

In the given sentence, they are saying their results are similar to those reported in citation, so it's more of a similarity, which fits the Similar class. However, the citation's inclusion in the sentence is part of comparing the results. So if they mention similarity, maybe both Similar and CoCoRes. 

But according to the classification guidelines, CoCoRes is direct comparison of results. Therefore, the direct comparison (similar results) would be CoCoRes. ThenSimilar might also be applicable as highlighting the similarity. 

But the example given for Similar is pointing out similarity between their work and cited work. Let me check if Similar is redundant here or if CoCoRes is a better fit. For example, if the cited work is mentioned as having similar results to the current work, then CoCoRes is the main class here because it's comparing results between studies. However, if the cited work's results support the current work's findings, then Support could apply. But the example for Support uses the cited work as corroborating their findings. 

In the given passage, the sentence says that their results are similar to those in the citation. So perhaps the primary category is CoCoRes for the comparison, and then Similar for the similarity aspect. However, since the classes are distinct, CoCoRes covers the comparison regardless of similarity or difference, while Similar is when they specifically state similarity in patterns, phenomena, etc. 

Hence, CoCoRes is primary (as it's the comparison of results), and Similar would also be relevant because they are indicating a similarity. Neutral could be third if there's no direct support. 

Looking at Neutral's example: "...since 1975 [citation]". Here's Neutral when the citation is used descriptively. 

In our case, the citation is not descriptively mentioning something like the time, but rather discussing results. So Neutral isn't applicable here. 

So the most appropriate classes would be:

1. CoCoRes (direct comparison of results, similarity included)
2. Similar (points out similarity between cited work and current findings)
3. Support? Or Weakness/Future? Let me see if any other classes apply. 

Wait, the sentence doesn't seem to imply support; instead, comparing results. Support is when the cited work supports their findings. If they say "Our results support the findings of citation", then Support applies. But saying their results are similar could mean mutual support. 

Alternatively, in the example given for Similar, the cited work is cited as a similar finding. For instance, "Our finding is supported by..." but in the given passage, it's "results reported in [citation] are similar to..." So perhaps it's mutual support. 

But the example for Similar is similar findings, so maybe Similar is indeed applicable. 

So the ranking would be:

1. CoCoRes
2. Similar
3. Support? Or maybe Neutral? Wait, maybe Neutral isn't here. 

Wait, perhaps Support isn't directly applicable here because they aren't confirming their own findings with the cited work's results. They're stating that their results are similar to those of another study. So perhaps Support isn't the right category. Neutral is also not applicable. 

Wait, perhaps Neutral isn't the third class. Let me think again. If the citation is used to report the cited work's study in context of comparing results, then CoCoRes is primary. Similar is secondary because they are pointing out similarity. What about the third class? 

Looking for other possibilities. Maybe the sentence isn't using Weakness or Future, etc. Since the citation isn't criticizing the cited work nor suggesting future work. 

So if the primary is CoCoRes and secondary is Similar, perhaps Neutral isn't applicable, but maybe the third is Support? Wait, maybe if the cited work's results support their findings, then Support. 

Alternatively, maybe Basis is possible? No, the cited work isn't introducing foundational information for the current research. 

The citation is part of a comparison, which is covered by CoCoRes and Similar. Maybe Neutral is not relevant here, but perhaps Neutral is possible if the citation is just descriptive. 

Alternatively, perhaps CoCoXY isn't applicable. 

Hmm, maybe the ranking is CoCoRes, Similar, then Neutral if needed. But Neutral example is descriptive. Since the citation is part of a comparison, Neutral probably isn't applicable. 

So perhaps the top three are CoCoRes, Similar, and then... Maybe Support if any part of their finding is being supported by the cited work's results. If the cited work's results corroborate their findings, then Support applies. 

For example, in the passage, their results are similar to the cited work's results. That could mean that their findings are supported by the cited work. Hence, Support might be applicable. 

But according to the example given for Support, it's "consistent with previous research". Here, saying similar results might align with the Support category. 

Therefore, the three classes could be CoCoRes (comparison of results), Similar (similarity between works), and Support (current findings supported by cited work's results). However, perhaps that's overlapping. 

Alternatively, maybe the correct top three are CoCoRes first, then Similar, and then CoCoXY or other? No, CoCoXY is comparing two studies with each other. 

In this case, CoCoXY is when you compare two cited studies. For example: "Conflicting results are described in..." So CoCoXY is comparing the cited works themselves. Our case is comparing the citing work's results with a cited work's results, so CoCoRes is correct. 

So after considering all factors, the top three classes are:

1. CoCoRes (direct comparison of results between citing and cited papers)
2. Similar (similarity between cited work's results and current's)
3. Support (if applicable)
Wait, maybe Support isn't needed here. Alternatively, Neutral is not here. Maybe the third class is Neutral or another. Let me reconsider. 

The three classes should be distinct. If the citation is part of comparing results and highlighting similarity, then CoCoRes and Similar are both relevant. Are there other classes? The third could be Neutral if needed. 

But according to the example for Neutral, it's used in a descriptive way, not supporting or comparing. Since the citation here is part of comparing results, Neutral isn't applicable. 

Another possible third class could be Basis, but the cited work isn't foundational for the current study. It's just a comparative work. 

What about Future? No indication of future work here. 

Motivation? No, the purpose isn't to justify why the current research is needed. 

Usage? No methods are directly used. 

Weakness? Not relevant as there's no criticism. 

Therefore, the third class might be Support, as the cited work's results support the citing work's findings. 

So final ranking:

1. CoCoRes
2. Similar
3. Support

But wait, in the example given for Support: "All subscales were consistent with previous research... [citation]". So when their findings are consistent with cited work. In the given case, the cited work's results are similar to their own. That seems like a case where the cited work's findings support their results. Therefore, Support applies as well. 

So the top three classes would be CoCoRes, Similar, and Support. But according to the classification instructions, they want three distinct classes ranked from most to least appropriate. 

But maybe the correct ranking is CoCoRes, Similar, and then maybe Neutral as the least? Hmm, but Neutral isn't applicable. 

Wait, let's check again. If the citation is used to show similarity in results between works, that's Similar. Also, since they mention comparison of results, that's CoCoRes. The question is whether both are applicable. 

In some classification systems, these could be overlapping categories. But according to the definitions given, CoCoRes is specifically for comparing two studies' results while Similar is when the citing paper points out similarity. 

So if the sentence is both comparing results and highlighting similarity, both classes apply. But which one is more appropriate? 

Looking back at the example for Similar, it's "Our finding... is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations... [citation]". The cited work's study found a similar pattern, hence Similarity. 

So if the cited work's results are similar to theirs, then Similar applies. 

Therefore, the three top classes would be CoCoRes (comparing results), Similar (indicating similarity), and maybe Neutral as third if needed. Wait, maybe Neutral is not applicable. 

Wait, the third class could be Support if the cited work's results support their findings. If the cited work supports the citing authors' findings, Support applies. In the example given for Support, they use the cited work to validate their own subscales. So yes, if citing authors find similar results as cited work's, that could imply Support. 

Therefore, ranking them: 

CoCoRes as first, Similar as second, Support as third.
