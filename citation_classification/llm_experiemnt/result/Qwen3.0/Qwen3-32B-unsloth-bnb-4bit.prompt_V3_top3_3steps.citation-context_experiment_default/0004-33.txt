Okay, let me try to work through this step by step.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The citation is in the sentence: "However, recent research on plant health has highlighted the importance of integrated pest management approaches @@CITATION@@ as a means to reduce chemical pesticide use while maintaining or enhancing crop yields. These findings corroborate the results of earlier studies indicating that sustainable practices can lead to long-term benefits @@CITATION@@." Wait, actually, there's two citations here. But the user specifically mentions the citation marked @@CITATION@@, so maybe it's referring to the first one? Wait, the passage provided might have a citation tagged like that. Let me check again. Oh, maybe the passage is part of the input but here the example is hypothetical. Wait, perhaps the actual input would have a specific passage with the @@CITATION@@ placeholder, but since I don't have the real passage, maybe this is a test example. Wait, actually the user provided a generic example in the task description, perhaps expecting me to work through that. Let me proceed with the example given in the definitions, maybe?

In the example under 'Support', the context is: “All subscales were consistent with previous research, particularly that of @@CITATION@@ also using a U.S. sample...” The intent here is to support their findings by pointing to similar previous research. So the rhetorical class would be Support here.

But let's think about a hypothetical scenario. Suppose the citation is used to support the current argument by confirming results. Maybe in the given passage, the authors mention that their results align with prior work, which would indicate Support. Or if they're contrasting their methods with cited work, it's CoCoGM. If they point out a knowledge gap, then Motivation. 

The task is to take the provided passage, extract the context around the citation, determine the intent, and then assign the top three classes.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to simulate using the example provided. Let's take the example under 'Support': the citation is used to support the current work. So the top class would be Support. Then, maybe Similar? Because if they are showing similarity between their results and the cited work. But the example under Similar says they point out a similarity in findings, such as both studies observed the same phenomenon. 

In the Support example, the authors say their subscales were consistent with previous research, so maybe Support is appropriate but also Similar. However, according to the definitions, Support is when they use the citation to support their work, whereas Similar is pointing out similarity between their work and the cited work. So perhaps Support and Similar can co-occur but maybe ranked differently based on context.

If the primary purpose is to support their claim by referring to prior work, then Support would be the top class. If the citation is also used to highlight similarity in results, Similar would be secondary. CoCoRes could be if they are comparing their results directly with the cited work's results, but in the Support example, it's more about agreement than direct comparison. 

So, based on the example, Support would be the primary class, then maybe Similar. Neutral could be third if they just mention the citation without strong support, but in the example, the support is explicit. However, maybe the Neutral class isn't applicable here. 

But the output example in the prompt shows CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Neutral. Wait, no, the output example is hypothetical. Let me re-examine the user's instructions.

The user's task says to output the top three classes for the cited passage. The example given in the problem is perhaps hypothetical. Let me follow the steps again:

Step 1: Extract context around the citation. Suppose the citation is used to compare results with previous work, like the CoCoRes example. 

Step 2: Identify the general intent. If the intent is comparative, then CoCoRes. 

Step 3: Assign specific classes. The example for CoCoRes says the current work's results substantially differ from cited work's, so CoCoRes is the primary. 

If following that pattern, the correct output would be CoCoRes first. Then maybe CoCoXY if they are comparing two cited studies, but in the example, they compare their work with cited work directly. 

Wait, the example under CoCoRes is a direct comparison of results between current work and cited work. So the primary class is CoCoRes. Possible second could be CoCoGM if there's a comparison in goals/methods, but if the sentence only compares results, perhaps Neutral is third. 

But Neutral is when the citation is used neutrally, descriptively. If the sentence is stating a fact without strong argumentation, Neutral would be appropriate. For example, mentioning prior research existed without directly using it to support, contrast, compare. 

So in the example given under CoCoRes, the output example's answer would be CoCoRes first. Let me think again about the user's output example. Wait, the user provided an example response like:

1. CoCoRes  
2. CoCoXY  
3. Neutral

But that's under their example scenario. However, perhaps the correct answer depends on the specific context. 

Since I don't have the real passage, perhaps in this hypothetical exercise, given the example under CoCoXY where two cited studies are compared with each other, the output would be CoCoXY first, then CoCoRes, Neutral third. But that's just a guess. 

Alternatively, in the user's CoCoXY example, two studies are compared, so CoCoXY is the primary, and maybe CoCoRes as secondary if there's also comparison between the cited work's results and current. But in that example, it's conflicting results in the two cited studies. 

So the answer would depend on whether the citation is comparing cited work with current work (CoCoRes) or comparing two cited works (CoCoXY). 

Since the user's task is to classify the given passage's citation, but without the actual passage, perhaps the example provided in the problem's context is the one where the CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Neutral classification applies. However, the user wants me to process a passage but since I don't have the specific passage, perhaps I should rely on the example given in the prompt. 

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to follow the example provided by the user under each rhetorical class. For instance, if the passage is similar to the Support example given, then Support would be the first class. 

Assuming the passage is the Support example provided by the user: “All subscales were consistent with previous research, particularly that of @@CITATION@@ also using a U.S. sample...” 

Step 1: Extract context: the authors' subscales are consistent with previous research (cited). 

Step 2: Intent is Supportive → Support class. 

Step 3: Top three classes. Since the primary intent is Support, then maybe Similar is secondary because their results are similar. However, according to the definitions, Support is when the citation confirms the citing authors' work, whereas Similar is when they point out similarity between their work and the cited. In the example, the citing work's subscales are consistent with previous research, so Support. If the cited work has results similar to theirs, then Similar could also apply. 

But the Support class's definition says it's to support, confirm the work. The Similar class says pointing out similarity between the citing paper and cited work. So both could apply, but perhaps ranked differently. 

Looking at the definitions, Support is when the authors support their current work using the citation. Similar is when similarities are pointed out between the works. 

In the example provided, it's both supporting (consistent with previous) and similarity (same results). So both Support and Similar could be applicable, potentially. But maybe Support is primary. 

Other classes like CoCoRes could be secondary if comparing results, but the example doesn't indicate that. 

So for the given Support example, the top three would be Support (1), then maybe Neutral or Similar (2), Neutral third. 

But since Similar is specifically about similarity between citing and the cited work, and Support is about supporting, they can co-occur but perhaps ranked differently. 

Given the example's answer, perhaps Support (1), Similar (2), Neutral (3). However, Neutral might not be appropriate here. 

In this case, perhaps the correct response is:

1. Support  
2. Similar  
3. Basis  

But Basis is when the citation is foundational. 

Alternatively, perhaps Support is first, then Basis, Neutral third. 

But this is speculative. Given that the example given under Support is more about support than foundation, I think Basis is not applicable here. 

Given all that, perhaps for the example provided in the Support scenario, the top classes are Support, then maybe Similar, and third could be CoCoRes. 

But I'm not sure. Given the information and the definitions, I'll proceed.
