Okay, let's see. I need to determine the top three rhetorical classes for the given citation. First, I'll extract the context around the citation in the passage. The user mentioned the citation is in a plant health domain scientific article. The example given is about phytoplasma strains in daisy plants and conflicting results in Euphorbia pulcherrima. The citation is used to compare two studies (Wei et al., 2004; Saracco et al., 2006) with another study mentioned via the citation tag.

Looking at the example in the CoCoXY definition, it's when two cited studies are compared with each other, not with the current paper. The example sentence mentions fast multiplication rates in phytoplasma strains in daisies and then references conflicting results in Euphorbia pulcherrima, citing another study. So the citation here is used to point out conflicting results between different cited works, which fits CoCoXY.

Next, the general intent seems to highlight conflicting findings between two phytoplasma studies. That's a comparison of explanations or claims between cited studies, so CoCoXY is the primary class. Then, maybe Support or Similar if there's confirmation of results. But in the example, it's about conflicting results, so perhaps Weakness isn't correct. Neutral might be if it's just stating facts without argument. However, since it's contrasting studies, CoCoXY is first. The next could be Similar if it's pointing out a similarity despite the conflict, but that's not the case here. Maybe CoCoRes if comparing results with the current paper's findings, but the example given doesn't mention the current work's results. The example is comparing two other studies, so CoCoXY is the top. The other possibilities might be Basis or Motivation, but the context is contrasting studies, not foundational or motivating the current work. So CoCoXY is first. The next classes would depend on secondary intents. If they mention conflicting results, maybe Weakness, but I think CoCoXY is the primary. Maybe Neutral as a third if there's no specific argument beyond the comparison. But according to the example provided, CoCoXY is the main class, followed by perhaps CoCoRes or CoCoGM. Wait, in the example given in CoCoXY, the conflicting results are being compared between two studies. So the citation here is used to compare two cited studies, not the current one. Therefore, the top three classes would be CoCoXY first, maybe Neutral if the rest is just stating facts, but Neutral is used when there's no argumentative intent. Wait, in the example sentence, the authors are highlighting conflicting results between two phytoplasma studies in Euphorbia, which is a comparison between cited worksâ€”that's CoCoXY. The third class could be Neutral if there's no further argument, but maybe Support if they support their current findings by contrasting others. Wait, in the example, they might be explaining conflicting results found in different studies. So CoCoXY is the main class. The second might be CoCoRes if comparing results between their work and the cited works, but in this case, the example sentence doesn't mention their work's own results. Therefore, maybe Support isn't applicable here. Neutral might be third if they're just stating facts without argument, but the comparison of conflicting results is analytical. Alternatively, CoCoRes could be if the citation is contrasting results, even if between studies. Wait, CoCoRes is for comparing the current paper's results with cited works, while CoCoXY is for comparing cited studies with each other. Since the example cites two studies and then another conflicting one, the primary citation is CoCoXY. Then, perhaps Future or Weakness if suggesting further research directions, but the example doesn't mention future work. Neutral might not be right. Maybe Neutral is the third if the citation is just describing findings without direct comparison. But given the example's structure, after highlighting conflicting results, maybe Weakness isn't applicable here. So the top three would be CoCoXY first, Neutral second if there's no further argument, but perhaps CoCoXY is the only one. Wait, the user's output example for CoCoXY's example lists CoCoXY first, then Neutral as third. Hmm, maybe in the user's example, the third was Neutral. So in this case, perhaps CoCoXY is first, then Neutral or CoCoRes. Alternatively, maybe CoCoRes if the cited work's results are conflicting with the current work's claims, but in the example given, the current work doesn't mention their own results. Therefore, CoCoXY is first, then Neutral or Similar. But since it's conflicting results, perhaps Weakness is the third. Wait, Weakness is when the citation is criticizing or pointing out flaws. Here, the authors are just pointing out conflicting results between studies, not criticizing one. So maybe Neutral is third. So the top three would be CoCoXY, then maybe Support if they're supporting their current discussion by citing the conflicting results, but that's not the case here. Alternatively, maybe CoCoRes is the second. But CoCoRes is between the current work and cited works. Hmm, this is tricky. The best fit is CoCoXY as first class. The next might be CoCoRes or Weakness, but given the example's structure, it's CoCoXY first. Let me stick with the example given by the user. In their CoCoXY example, the third class was Neutral. So perhaps Neutral is the third here.
