Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the cited paper with the @@CITATION@@ tag. Since the task doesn't provide a specific example passage, I'll imagine a typical sentence from a plant health research context. Let's assume the citation is used in a sentence like: "Our findings regarding leaf pathogen resistance mechanisms align with those described by @@CITATION@@, particularly their observation on gene expression patterns related to defense responses." 

Step 1: Extract the context. The semantic context here is that the authors are pointing out similarity between their findings and those of the cited work, specifically about gene expression patterns in defense mechanisms.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. Since they're stating their findings align with previous results, the intent is to support their current findings by referencing this prior work. This suggests a supportive rhetorical stance.

Step 3: Assign the specific classes. The primary class here would be "Similar" because they're highlighting similarity between their work and the cited study. Next, "Support" might also apply since they use the cited work to back up their findings. "Neutral" could be third if theyâ€™re just stating a fact without strong support or motivation, but given the wording "align with," Support seems more fitting than Neutral. Alternatively, CoCoXY or others might not apply unless there's a comparison between two cited works, which isn't indicated here. Therefore, the top three classes would be Similar, Support, Neutral.

1. Similar  
2. Support  
3. Neutral
