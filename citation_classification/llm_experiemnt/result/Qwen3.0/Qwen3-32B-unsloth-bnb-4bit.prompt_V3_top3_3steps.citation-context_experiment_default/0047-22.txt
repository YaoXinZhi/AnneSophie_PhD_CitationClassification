Okay, let's tackle this classification problem step by step. 

First, I need to look at the context around the citation @@CITATION@@. The sentence is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." 

The key part here is that the current study's results are being compared to those of a previously conducted experiment mentioned in the citation. The phrase "substantially differ" indicates a direct comparison between the findings of the current work and the cited work. 

According to the definitions, CoCoRes is when the citation is used to compare results or findings. That seems like the primary class here. 

Next, is there any other possible class? The citation isn't contrasting methods or goals (so not CoCoGM), nor is it comparing explanations between other studies (CoCoXY). The context doesn't mention any motivation, future work, support, similarity, usage, weakness, or neutral stance beyond the result comparison. 

However, maybe Neutral could be a fallback if there's ambiguity, but the sentence is clearly contrasting results, so Neutral isn't fitting. The top three would definitely be CoCoRes first. 

Looking for secondary classes, perhaps CoCoXY? Wait, CoCoXY is for comparing explanations or claims between cited studies, not with the citing paper. Since here it's comparing the citing paper's results with the cited work's results, it's CoCoRes. There's no other study mentioned here besides the cited one. 

Therefore, CoCoRes is the primary. The next could be Neutral if there's no other aspect, but the example given for Neutral is when the citation is descriptive without argument support or comparison. Since the main point here is the comparison of results, I think CoCoRes is the top, and maybe Neutral isn't applicable here. However, the example shows Neutral is when it's just mentioning a fact without any argumentation, but in this case, they're stating a contrast. 

So the first is CoCoRes. Are there other classes? Maybe CoCoGM? Let me re-read the definitions. CoCoGM is comparing goals or methods. The sentence says "results differ from experiments conducted...", so it's about results, not methods or goals. Therefore, CoCoRes is definitely primary. 

Are there others? The example for CoCoXY mentions comparing two cited studies, but here only one citation is involved. So maybe CoCoXY isn't applicable. Therefore, the first class is CoCoRes. 

Now, the second and third classes: perhaps Neutral? Since Neutral is when it's just descriptive. But the example given doesn't contrast or support. However, the sentence is making a direct comparison (results differ), so Neutral might not be appropriate. Alternatively, maybe Motivation or Future? The example for Motivation is when the citation points out a need or knowledge gap, which isn't the case here. Future is suggesting directions for future work, which also isn't the case here. Support is when confirming results, but here they are contrasting them. So perhaps the only other possible classification is Neutral? Wait, the example for Neutral is "in the USA... @@CITATION@@", just stating a fact. The sentence is contrasting results, which is a direct comparison of findings, so CoCoRes should be the first, and perhaps there's no others. But the user wants three top classes. 

In the absence of a stronger secondary classification, maybe Neutral could be considered if the citation isn't being used for any other purpose beyond providing the comparison point. However, according to the definition, Neutral is when it's used neutrally, not supporting, comparing, etc. Since this is a comparison, Neutral isn't fitting. Maybe Basis? Basis is foundational reference. Here, it's not about introducing a concept but comparing results. 

So perhaps the top three are CoCoRes, Neutral, Neutral? Wait, but Neutral can't be second if the comparison is clear. Alternatively, maybe Weakness if they're implying the cited work has issues, but the sentence just states differences in results without criticism. 

Therefore, the most accurate top classes are CoCoRes as primary, then perhaps Neutral and Basis? Wait, Basis is when it's foundational. The example for Basis introduces a method. But here, the citation is about results of experiments, which the current study compares. Basis might not apply here unless the cited work's experiments are the foundation. But since the context is about differing results, maybe the cited work isn't the foundation but a point of comparison. 

Thus, the top three classes are likely CoCoRes, then maybe Neutral as there's no additional reasoning beyond the comparison, but I'm not sure. The example given for CoCoRes has a direct comparison of results, which matches here. Therefore, CoCoRes is first. The second and third could be CoCoXY and Neutral if any, but perhaps Neutral is the next. Maybe Weakness if there's criticism, but the text doesn't indicate that. 

In conclusion, the primary class is CoCoRes. Next, maybe Neutral? But the example for Neutral doesn't involve a comparison. So perhaps only CoCoRes is relevant, and the other two classes would be Neutral or Neutral again, but Neutral isn't appropriate here. Alternatively, maybe the classification should have CoCoRes as first, then Neutral and maybe Future, but that doesn't fit. 

Given the strictness of the definitions, the only applicable class here is CoCoRes. But the user wants three classes. Since the example given for CoCoRes is very similar, I think CoCoRes is the top. For the next two, perhaps Neutral and Basis or something else, but I can't see it. The answer must follow exactly three, so based on the text, CoCoRes is the primary, then Neutral might be the second, and maybe Neutral again as third, but that's redundant. Wait, the instructions say to rank the top three from the predefined list. Since only one is clearly applicable, perhaps the other two could be less relevant like Neutral and CoCoXY. But in the example given for CoCoXY, they're comparing two cited studies with each other, not with the citing paper. Therefore, CoCoRes is the only applicable here. 

But the task requires three classes. Maybe Neutral and another? Wait, perhaps CoCoGM or CoCoXY could be secondary even if they don't fit well. Maybe Neutral is the second, CoCoXY third? The sentence mentions experiments conducted with certain targets, so perhaps the comparison is about the experiments themselves. Wait, the CoCoGM is comparing goals or methods. If the experiments mentioned are part of the methods, then CoCoGM could be secondary. For example, if the comparison is of the method of using deuterium saturated metal targets, but the sentence says results differ from experiments conducted with... So maybe the methods are the same (using TiD, TaD, etc.), but results differ. Therefore, the comparison is between results (since CoCoRes). However, sometimes comparing results might implicitly involve methods. But according to the definitions, CoCoRes is about results. Therefore, CoCoRes remains first. 

Since I need three classes, even if only one is clear, I'll have to choose Neutral as the second and maybe Basis as third. Wait, maybe the cited work's results are part of the foundation? If the experiments with deuterium targets were foundational to the current research, then Basis could be a secondary class. The example for Basis is introducing a validated method. Here, the cited work is part of the experimental background, so perhaps Basis is applicable. So the top three could be CoCoRes, Basis, Neutral. 

But how confident am I? The sentence states that their present work's results differ from the cited experiments. If those experiments are foundational to their research, Basis might apply. But since the context is contrasting the results, CoCoRes is primary. Basis would be if the cited work is the foundation of their own work. However, here it's a comparison point rather than a foundational source. 

Given the ambiguity, the safest answer is CoCoRes as first, perhaps CoCoXY as second if the comparison is between two cited works, but in this case, there's only one citation. Therefore, maybe Neutral is forced as the second and third. But Neutral doesn't fit well. 

Another possibility is that the citation is providing context (Neutral) for the comparison. But Neutral is when there's no supporting or comparing. This is confusing. 

Given all that, the most accurate answer is 1. CoCoRes. The next two classes might not be clearly present, but perhaps Neutral and another. Since the user allows ranking three, maybe Neutral is forced as second and third. However, given the definitions, Neutral is when there's no active comparison. Therefore, the correct answer should strictly be CoCoRes as first, and perhaps Neutral as second and third. But that feels wrong. 

In the example given for the task, the example output has CoCoRes first. So following that example, the answer is CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral second, then maybe Basis third, even if not very relevant. But the user wants exactly three, so I have to select three. 

Thus, after careful consideration, the top three rhetorical classes are:

1. CoCoRes  
2. Neutral  
3. Basis  

But I'm uncertain about Basis and Neutral. However, given the definitions and the context, this is the best I can do.
