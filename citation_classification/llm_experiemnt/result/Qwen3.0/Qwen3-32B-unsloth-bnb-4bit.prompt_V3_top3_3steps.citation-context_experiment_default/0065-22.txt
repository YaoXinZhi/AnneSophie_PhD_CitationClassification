Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. 

First, I need to extract the context around the @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. The passage mentions, “This method has been previously applied to similar studies in citrus plants @@CITATION@@, yielding promising results.” The semantic context here is about the application of a method similar to previous studies in citrus plants.

Next, identifying the general intent. The citation is referencing prior work where the method was applied in similar studies, which supports the current research by showing a foundation or existing use. This suggests the intent is foundational, perhaps to establish basis or support for the current work. The phrase “yielding promising results” might indicate motivation, suggesting the previous results motivated further application.

Now, ranking the specific rhetorical classes. The top three candidates here would be Support (as the authors refer to previous work to support their method's application), Basis (since it's foundational for their current approach), and Motivation (because the promising results might inspire their current study). CoCoXY isn't relevant here as it's about comparing two other studies. Usage is less likely because they're not directly using the method from the cited work but rather citing similar applications. Weakness or Neutral seem off-topic as there's no criticism or mere description without argument.
