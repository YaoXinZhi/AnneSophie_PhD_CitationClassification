Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions @@CITATION@@ presenting a phylogenetic analysis based on COI barcoding and ITS nrDNA sequences of several species. The authors observed contrasting patterns between COI and ITS datasets, but when combining them, the monophyletic status of two genera wasn't resolved. The current study aims to address this by expanding taxon sampling.

Next, understanding the general intent. The citation here seems to be referencing previous work that has conflicting results, which is why the current research is being conducted. That sounds like Motivation since they're addressing a problem identified in prior studies. 

Looking at the specific rhetorical classes, Motivation fits because the authors are explaining why their research is neededâ€”due to unresolved phylogeny in the cited work. CoCoRes could apply because they're comparing their findings to the cited results. Neutral might be there too as they're just stating the previous findings without direct support or criticism. 

So the top three would be Motivation, CoCoRes, and Neutral.

1. Motivation  
2. CoCoRes  
3. Neutral
