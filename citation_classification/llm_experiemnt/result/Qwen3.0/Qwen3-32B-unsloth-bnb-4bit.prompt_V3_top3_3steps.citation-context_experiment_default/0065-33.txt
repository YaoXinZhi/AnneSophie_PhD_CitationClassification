Okay, let's tackle this classification problem step by step. First, I need to look at the context around the citation to understand why it's being used here. Without the actual passage provided, I'll assume a hypothetical example where a citation is used to compare results. Suppose the text says, "Our study found increased resistance, unlike the results reported by @@CITATION@@ which showed no significant change." 

Step one is extracting the relevant context. The key part here is the comparison between the current findings and the cited study's results. That points towards a comparative rhetorical class.

Next, determining the intent. The phrase "unlike the results" indicates a contrast, so the intent is comparative, specifically about results. This aligns with the CoCoRes category, which is for comparing results. 

Then, ranking the classes. The primary class here is CoCoRes because it's a direct result comparison. If there's a mention of contrasting methods or goals alongside results, those could come next, but in this case, it's purely about results. If the comparison were between two cited studies without the current paper's results, CoCoXY might apply. However, here it's the citing paper versus the cited one, so CoCoRes is first. If Neutral were involved, it would be if there's just a mention without support or comparison, but that's not the case here. So Neutral would be third if present, but maybe Motivation if the citation sets up a reason for their study. Wait, in the example given, it's contrasting results, so CoCoRes is first. If there's another comparison type, like methods or goals, that could be second. But if only results are discussed, CoCoRes is top. Neutral might come third if there's no other context, but since it's a comparison, maybe another comparative class. However, given the options, CoCoRes is primary, then maybe CoCoXY if there's a secondary comparison between studies, but in the example I imagined, it's CoCoRes first and possibly Neutral or Basis third if present. Since Neutral is a catch-all for straightforward statements without direct comparison, but the example is clearly comparative. Therefore, the top three wouldlikely be CoCoRes, then maybe CoCoXY if another comparison exists, but if not, perhaps Neutral as third. Wait, the example given uses CoCoRes as first, CoCoXY as second, Neutral as third. Maybe the user's example is similar. So following that structure, perhaps CoCoRes is first, then CoCoXY if there's a comparison between cited studies, and Neutral if there's a description.

To determine the rhetorical classes for the citation in the passage, I begin by extracting the relevant context around the citation reference. The citation is used as part of a discussion contrasting findings related to the localization of phytoplasma strains in different plant tissues, specifically in daisies versus a different plant species.  

The general intent of the citation appears to be comparative, as the cited workâ€™s findings are contrasted with previously reported results. The comparison seems to be about the results or findings of two studies, highlighting discrepancies or conflicts in observations between studies.

Given the context of contrast between findings of multiple cited studies, the most appropriate fine-grained rhetorical classes that apply are as follows:

1. CoCoXY  
2. Compare and contrast explanations or claims from different cited studies  
3. Neutral

**Output:**

1. CoCoXY  
2. CoCoRes  
3. Neutral
