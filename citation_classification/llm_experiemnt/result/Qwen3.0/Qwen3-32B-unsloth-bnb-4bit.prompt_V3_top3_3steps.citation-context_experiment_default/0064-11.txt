Okay, let me tackle this classification task step by step. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation marked @@CITATION@@. The passage mentions that the authors compared their results to those of previous studies and highlighted differences. Specifically, the example given is about experimental results with different metal targets. 

Next, determining the general intent. Since the citation is used to contrast results from their study with those cited, that points towards a Comparative intent, specifically in the context of results. The example provided in the definitions under CoCoRes matches this scenario where results are directly compared.

For the specific rhetorical classes, CoCoRes would be the top choice here. The mention of conflicting results in another study (CoCoXY) is present but not the primary comparison hereâ€”it's between their results and the cited work. However, since the primary comparison is between the current study and the cited, CoCoRes is first. There's also a slight descriptive element since they mention the existence of conflicting results, so Neutral could be a third option if there's no clear support or motivation.

1. CoCoRes  
2. CoCoXY  
3. Neutral
