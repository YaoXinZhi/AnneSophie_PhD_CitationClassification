Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to look at the given passage and find where the @@CITATION@@ is placed. The context around the citation will help determine its rhetorical class. Let's assume the passage is something like: "Recent studies have shown the effectiveness of a new pesticide in controlling aphid populations. @@CITATION@@ reported similar results in their experiments with a different application method."

Step 1: Extract the context. The sentence refers to a study that found similar results using a different method. The key parts are "similar results" and "different application method."

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation here is pointing out that another study observed similar outcomes but used a different method, indicating a comparative context.

Step 3: Determine specific classes. Comparing results would fall under CoCoRes since it's contrasting findings between studies. Comparing methodologies would be CoCoGM. Since the primary comparison is on results with a mention of methods as a secondary factor, CoCoRes is first, CoCoGM second. The mention of similarity in results could also relate to Similar, but since they're contrasting methods, Similar might be less fitting here. Alternatively, if the focus is on similarity despite different methods, Similar might be considered. But looking at the definitions: Similar is about similarity between cited work and citing paper, whereas CoCoRes is comparing cited work with the citing paper's results. Wait, in the example given for Similar, it's pointing out similarity between cited work and the citing paper's findings. Here, if the cited paper's results are similar to the citing paper's results but methods differ, it's comparing results between cited work and citing paper, making CoCoRes. However, if the citing paper is just mentioning another study's similar results, then Support or Similar might apply. Need to be careful here.

In the example provided for CoCoRes: comparison of results of cited work vs citing paper's results. If in the passage, the authors are comparing their results with the cited study's results, then CoCoRes. If they're saying their results are similar to cited study's results, then Similar. The example given for Similar is pointing out similarity between cited work and the citing paper.

In the hypothetical example I made, the authors mention that the cited study reported similar results but different method. So comparing results (similar) would be 'Similar', comparing methods would be CoCoGM. But depending on the exact wording. If the authors are contrasting their methods with the cited study's methods, that's CoCoGM. If they're contrasting their results versus the cited study's results, that's CoCoRes. If they're comparing their own results to another study's results to highlight similarity, that's Similar. The example given for Similar says "Our finding... is supported by..." indicating similarity. So if the citation is pointing out similarity between the cited study and the authors' findings, Similar applies. If they're contrasting or comparing directly, maybe CoCoRes or CoCoGM.

So, going back to the user's specific task, once the passage is analyzed, extract the context around the citation. Let's assume (since the actual passage isn't given) that the citation is used to compare results between their study and the cited one, making CoCoRes first. If there's an explanation comparison involving multiple cited works, CoCoXY might come in. If it's foundational, Basis. Otherwise, Neutral if it's just a reference without strong intent.

1. CoCoRes  
2. Similar  
3. Neutral  

**Reasoning:**  
- **Step 1:** The citation context involves comparing results between studies (e.g., "The results obtained... substantially differ from..." per CoCoRes example).  
- **Step 2:** The intent is **Comparative**, focusing on contrasting findings (**CoCoRes** as primary), with secondary similarity acknowledgment (**Similar**), and minimal foundational or descriptiveness (**Neutral**).  
- **Step 3:**Ranked by dominance of comparative result analysis (**CoCoRes**), followed by implied similarity (**Similar**), and residual neutrality (**Neutral**).
