Okay, let's tackle this classification task step by step. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation @@CITATION@@. The passage says, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." So the main point here is about comparing results between the current study and the cited work.

Next, the general intent seems to be a direct comparison of results. According to the provided categories, when a citation is used to contrast findings, it falls under CoCoRes. The example given in the CoCoRes definition matches this scenario exactly.

Now, checking for other possible classes. The citation isn't comparing different cited studies with each other, so CoCoXY isn't suitable here. Also, it's not mentioning similarities or supporting the current work, so Similar or Support can be eliminated. The comparison here is specifically between the present results and the cited ones, so CoCoRes is the primary class. There's no mention of future directions, motivation, or methods, so those can't be secondary classes here. Neutral is unlikely since the context is clearly comparative. Hence, the top three are CoCoRes first, then perhaps Neutral as the cited work is referenced purely for result comparison without additional context, making Neutral the third. CoCoGM is less likely here since the comparison isn't about goals or methods but results. Therefore, ranked as CoCoRes first, Neutral second, perhaps CoCoXY third if there's any indirect comparison between the cited studies, but given the examples provided, CoCoXY is more about two cited works compared to each other. So Neutral remains third.
