Okay, let's tackle this classification task step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the citation marked @@CITATION@@. The example given has a sentence like “...results of the present work substantially differ from ... @@CITATION@@.” So in the given passage, I look for the sentence that includes @@CITATION@@ and the surrounding text to understand the reason for the citation.

Next, determining the general intent. If the citation is pointing out differences in results between the current study and a previous one, that's CoCoRes (Comparison of Results). If it's contrasting explanations between two studies without directly referencing the current one, it might be CoCoXY. If there's a mention of a knowledge gap leading to the current research, that's Motivation. 

Looking at the example of CoCoRes: the text mentions that their results differ from those cited. Similarly, if the sentence says "Our findings contrast with the results reported in @@CITATION@@", that's CoCoRes. If it's comparing two cited studies without involving the current paper's results, it's CoCoXY. If the citation is just providing background information, it could be Basis or Support. 

Assuming the context is comparing the current study's results with the cited, then CoCoRes is primary. If neutral description of the cited work's results is mentioned without comparison, it would be Neutral. But if it's a direct comparison, CoCoRes ranks first, followed by CoCoXY if multiple studies are compared, and Neutral if there's a general statement. So, based on the structure of the example, I'd rank CoCoRes first, then CoCoXY, then Neutral as the third.
