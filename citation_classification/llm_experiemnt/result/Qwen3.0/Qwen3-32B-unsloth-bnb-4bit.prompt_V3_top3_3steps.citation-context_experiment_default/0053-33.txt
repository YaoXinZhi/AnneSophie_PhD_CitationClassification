Okay, let's try to figure out the rhetorical classes for this citation. The passage mentions that the current work is in the field of citrus huanglongbing (HLB) detection using hyperspectral imaging, and references a study that evaluated the same approach for detecting other diseases like citrus canker and bacterial spot.

First step is to extract the context around the citation. The key part is where they say, "This application builds on previously published work on disease detection using hyperspectral imaging, particularly a detailed review by @@CITATION@@ on the use of hyperspectral image processing methods for detection of citrus canker and bacterial spot..." So the citation is to a review that discussed methods for detecting those diseases.

Next, identify the intent. The authors are referencing a prior review to show they're building on existing work. That sounds like they're positioning their current study as an extension or continuation, using a foundational source. So the intent might be foundational or motivational.

Looking at classes like Basis, Motivation, and Support. Basis is when the citation sets the intellectual foundation. Since the review provides a foundation they are building on, Basis could be applicable. Motivation might be because they're justifying their research by showing prior work exists and they're applying it to a new disease (HLB). Also, maybe Support if they're confirming their approach's validity based on prior results.

Then, considering specific rhetorical classes. Basis would fit as the prior work's methods are foundational. Then Motivation, because the citation motivates why their current research is neededâ€”it's moving the field forward. Support might come in if they're supporting their method's use by citing similar approaches, but the example given in the Support class includes the cited work supporting similar results. However, in this case, they mention building on the prior work's detailed review, which is more about foundation or motivating the current work rather than supporting their own results directly.

Also, could there be a Comparison? They mention that their work is on a different disease, which might fall under CoCoGM or CoCoRes. But the example given for CoCoGM is comparing goals or methods. The citation here is about prior methods applied to different diseases, so maybe CoCoGM if comparing methods, but the main intent here is to base their work on previous research. So perhaps Basis is first, Motivation second (as justification), and Support third because the review supports their methodology's validity by showing prior use cases.
