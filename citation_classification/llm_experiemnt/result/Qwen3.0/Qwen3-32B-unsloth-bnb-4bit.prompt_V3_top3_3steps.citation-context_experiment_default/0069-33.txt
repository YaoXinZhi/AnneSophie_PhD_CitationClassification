Okay, let me figure out the top three rhetorical classes for the given citation example.

Starting with Step 1: The context provided around @CITATION@ is "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted..." So the key part is comparing the current study's results with those previously obtained by the cited work.

Step 2: The general intent here is clearly a comparison of results since it states the results "substantially differ". According to the definitions, this falls under Comparative â†’ CoCoRes.

Step 3: Now ranking the top three classes. The most direct match is CoCoRes. Next, perhaps CoCoXY since it's about contrasting results between studies, but the example given is more about comparison between their own results and cited results, not contrasting cited studies with each other. Maybe Future could be considered if there's implication of future work, but here it's directly pointing out differences. Neutral is less likely because there's an explicit comparison. Basis might come into play if it's foundational, but here it's about differing results. Motivation isn't the driver here. Support seems off-topic here. So the top three would likely be CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral if there's a generic reference, then CoCoGM if there's any methodological comparison. But based on the direct use, CoCoRes is the primary, followed by CoCoXY if between two cited studies, but the example mentions own results versus cited results. Maybe CoCoRes is primary, Neutral next as descriptive, then possibly Future if the comparison points to future directions but I don't see that. Wait, the example in CoCoRes is comparing present work's results with cited results. In the given context, similar structure exists. Therefore CoCoRes would be the top, Neutral might be third if the citation is just a neutral reference. So ranking would be CoCoRes first, then Neutral maybe second, but perhaps Weakness if the differing results are being presented as limitations, but the example doesn't indicate that criticism. Therefore Weakness is not here. So final top three should be CoCoRes as primary, Neutral as descriptive reference, and maybe Future if suggesting further research directions based on the differences. But I don't see that. So primary is CoCoRes. Then maybe CoCoXY if contrasting with another study's explanation, but here it's own work's results versus cited work's results. Therefore CoCoRes is most accurate. Following that, Neutral if there's no further argumentation beyond stating differences. Thus the top three would be CoCoRes as 1, Neutral as 2, and perhaps Support inversely if citing to support their claim of differences but examples state comparisons not support. So final decision: 1. CoCoRes, 2. Neutral, 3. CoCoXY?
