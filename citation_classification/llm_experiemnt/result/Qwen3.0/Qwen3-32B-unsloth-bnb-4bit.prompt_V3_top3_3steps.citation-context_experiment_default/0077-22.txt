Okay, let's tackle this classification task step by step. First, I need to look at the citation marked @@CITATION@@ in the given passage and extract the relevant context around it. The context is crucial for understanding the intent behind the citation. Once I have the context, I'll determine the general intent using the categories providedâ€”foundational, comparative, motivational, supportive, technical, critical/analytical, or descriptive. Then I'll assign the top three rhetorical classes based on the definitions given.

Looking at the example provided in the user's message might help clarify how the classes are applied. For instance, CoCoRes is about comparing results, while CoCoXY compares explanations or claims between two cited studies without involving the current paper. Support is when the citation backs up the authors' own work.

The key is to see whether the citation supports the current research, compares methods/results, motivates the study by pointing out gaps, or perhaps points out weaknesses in the cited work. Let me go through each step carefully.
