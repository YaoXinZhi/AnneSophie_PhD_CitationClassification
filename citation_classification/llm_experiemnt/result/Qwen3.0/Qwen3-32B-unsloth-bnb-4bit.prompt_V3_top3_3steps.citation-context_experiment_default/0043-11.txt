Okay, let's go through this step by step. First, I need to extract the context where the citation is mentioned. The passage says, "These results contrast strongly with previous studies that found high infection rates in adult plants @@CITATION@@".

So the context is about contrasting current results with previous findings cited by the reference. The main intent here is to compare the results of the cited work with the current study's results. 

Looking at the general intent categories, this falls under "Comparative" which corresponds to the classes CoCoRes because it's comparing results. 

For the fine-grained classes, since it's a direct contrast between their findings and previous results, CoCoRes is the primary class. There's also a mention of conflicting outcomes, which might imply a comparison of explanations or claims (CoCoXY) if they're contrasting interpretations, but in this case, it's more about the findings themselves, so CoCoRes is higher. The Neutral class might come into play if there's a descriptive use without a direct comparison, but the emphasis here is on contrasting results. 

Therefore, the top three classes would be CoCoRes, Neutral as it's describing the context without further argument, and possibly CoCoXY if there's an implied contrast in explanations, but in this case, it's more straightforward comparison of results.

1. CoCoRes  
2. Neutral  
3. CoCoXY
