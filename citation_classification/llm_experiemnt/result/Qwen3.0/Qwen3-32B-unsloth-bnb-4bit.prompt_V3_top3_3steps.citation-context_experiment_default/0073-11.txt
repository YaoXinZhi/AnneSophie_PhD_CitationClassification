Okay, let's tackle this classification task step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the citation marked @@CITATION@@ in the provided passage. The citation is in the sentence: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@."

So the context is that the authors are comparing their results with those from an experiment that used deuterium-saturated metal targets. The key here is the phrase "substantially differ," which indicates a direct comparison between their results and the cited work's results. 

Next, determining the general intent. The authors are pointing out a difference in results between two studies. According to the given categories, this falls under Comparative intent. Within Comparative, the possible classes are CoCoGM, CoCoRes, or CoCoXY. Since they're comparing results directly ("results... differ"), that fits CoCoRes as per the example given.

But wait, are there any other classes that might apply? Let me check. The example for CoCoRes is exactly about differing results compared with cited work. So definitely CoCoRes is the main one here. 

What about Neutral or Support? Neutral is when there's no direct support or criticism. Support would be if they agreed with the cited work. Here, they're contrasting, so CoCoRes is more accurate. 

Is there a mention of another study's limitations or weaknesses? No, it's just a comparison of findings. CoCoXY involves comparing two cited studies with each other, not with the current work. Since they're comparing their results with the cited one, CoCoRes is the top choice.

Now, looking at the secondary classes. The citation isn't used to support their findings nor as motivation. It's just a contrast of results. The example given for CoCoRes matches exactly. So the primary class is CoCoRes. 

Are there other possible classes? Neutral could be a stretch if there's no judgment, but the explicit comparison of differences suggests it's not neutral. Basis might apply if they're building on the cited work, but here it's contrasting. So the top class is CoCoRes.

Next steps: The remaining classes could be Neutral if there's no other implication. Wait, but the context is a direct comparison. Maybe Neutral isn't right. Wait, maybe there's no other intent here. The example for Neutral says it's descriptive without supporting or comparing. But the example here is a comparison, so Neutral would not be correct. Maybe the second class could be Nothing else, but according to instructions, we need three. Hmm. Wait, maybe the second is CoCoXY? Let me re-examine the example for CoCoXY: comparing two cited studies with each other, not with the citing paper. The current context is comparing the citing paper’s results with a cited study. Therefore CoCoRes is first. What about CoCoXY? No, because that's when comparing cited studies with each other. 

Therefore, the top class is CoCoRes. For the second and third classes, maybe CoCoGM or CoCoXY? But there's no mention of goals or methods here, just results. The sentence is strictly about results. So perhaps Neutral is secondary? Wait, Neutral is when citations are mentioned without support, comparison, etc. But in this case, they are contrasting results, so it's not Neutral. Maybe Basis isn't applicable here. So perhaps the top is CoCoRes, and others might not fit. But the task requires three top classes even if others are weak. Maybe Neutral if it's just descriptive? Wait, Neutral example is like mentioning dates or facts. So here, since they're comparing results directly, Neutral isn't the case. 

So maybe the top three are CoCoRes, then perhaps None, but per instructions, we have to list three. Wait, maybe Weakness or Support isn't applicable here. Let me check again. The citation is to show differing results. The example of CoCoRes is exactly that. So CoCoRes is 1. Are there other possible classes? Maybe CoCoGM if they compare methods, but since the sentence mentions results differing, CoCoRes is correct. Maybe Neutral if it's just descriptive, but no. So perhaps the top three are CoCoRes, then maybe Neutral (if forced), and then another? Hmm, maybe CoCoXY if there's another comparison mentioned. But the example sentence here doesn't mention another study besides the cited one. So probably CoCoRes is the only valid one, and the rest are Neutral or Basis. But Basis isn't applicable here. Wait, Basis is foundational. The cited work isn't a foundation, it's a comparison point. 

Therefore, the top class is CoCoRes. Since the user requires three classes, perhaps Neutral is the second and third? But according to the example, Neutral is when there's no specific intent. Wait, the example given for Neutral is mentioning a date or fact without supporting any point. Since the current sentence is a comparison, Neutral isn't valid. Maybe the second could be CoCoGM if some method is mentioned. But in this sentence, methods aren't compared, just results. So CoCoGM isn't applicable. 

Therefore, maybe the top three are CoCoRes, Neutral, and Basis. Wait, Basis is foundational. Since the citation here is contrasting results, not building upon the foundation, Basis isn't correct. Hmm. The user might require three rankings even if the first is the only clear one. Maybe CoCoRes, then maybe something else. Perhaps CoCoXY if there's another comparison with another study. Looking back at the example for CoCoXY: "Conflicting results were described...", which is similar. Wait, the example given in the problem includes a sentence where conflicting results are cited between two studies. In the user's example for CoCoXY: "conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma...", which is comparing two cited studies. In the current problem statement, the sentence is: "substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted..." which is comparing their results with the cited study. So it's CoCoRes, not CoCoXY. Therefore, CoCoXY isn't applicable here. 

So perhaps the top three are: CoCoRes as 1, then maybe Neutral as 2, and then Basis as 3. But Neutral might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps Weakness is the third if they critic the cited work's results. Wait, no. The citation is stating that their results differ, not that the cited work is flawed. Therefore, Weakness isn't applicable. 

After thorough consideration, the top three classes would be CoCoRes first, then maybe CoCoXY isn't applicable, Neutral might be forced as second, but based on context Neutral isn't correct. Wait, maybe Basis isn't second either. So perhaps the task requires three, even if two are weaker. Given the instructions, I need to provide three labels ranked from most to least appropriate. The only possible is CoCoRes, then maybe CoCoGM if there's a mention of methods. But the sentence mentions results. Hmm. 

Wait, let me re-read the original sentence: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." The key part is comparing results between their study and the cited one. Therefore, CoCoRes is definitely the top class. There's no mention of methods or goals, so CoCoGM isn't applicable. There's a mention of experimental setup (deuterium saturated metal targets), but that's part of the context, not comparison of methods. The comparison is results-based. So CoCoRes is first. 

The other two might have to be Neutral and something else. Wait, Neutral isn't valid. Since the citation is used to compare results, Neutral isn't the right class. Maybe Weakness if the cited work's results are problematic? But the sentence doesn't indicate that the cited work is flawed; it's just that the results differ. Therefore, Weakness isn't applicable. 

Given this, perhaps the top three are CoCoRes, then Basis (if forced), but Basis is foundational, which isn't the case here. Alternatively, Neutral might be listed as third if forced, even though it's not accurate. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. 

Since CoCoRes is the only appropriate class, maybe the other two are Neutral and Basis. But according to the definitions, Neutral is when you describe facts without comparison. Since the citation is used to contrast results, Neutral isn't accurate. Basis would apply if the cited work is foundational to the current study, which it's not—it's contrasting. So perhaps the task allows for only one correct classification with the others being placeholders. 

Given the required output format, I need to list exactly three. Since the instructions state to include the top three, maybe the answer is CoCoRes, then CoCoXY (even though it doesn't fit), and then Neutral. But that might be incorrect. Alternatively, maybe there's a misinterpretation here. Wait, the example given in the problem for CoCoXY is a conflicting result between two cited studies, but this case is between the current work and cited. So CoCoXY isn't applicable here. Therefore, the correct first is CoCoRes, and perhaps Neutral as second and third if we have to list three, even though it doesn't fit. 

But according to the problem's example, Neutral is when citing descriptive information without argument. Since the citation is used to compare results, Neutral isn't accurate. 

This leaves me to conclude that the correct primary class is CoCoRes, and the other two may not fit. However, the problem requires listing three, so perhaps the next best would be CoCoXY and Neutral. Even if it's forced. So for ranking purposes:

1. CoCoRes
2. CoCoXY
3. Neutral

But this might not be accurate. Wait, no—the example given in the problem statement for CoCoXY involves comparing two cited studies, which is not the case here. The current case is comparing the current study's results with cited results, so CoCoRes. Hence, the correct order is CoCoRes as first, then perhaps Nothing else fits, but per instructions, three must be chosen. Maybe Neutral as second, as third. But Neutral isn't appropriate. Hmm. This is tricky. I think the best possible ranking is CoCoRes first, then perhaps CoCoGM if there's a mention of methods. But there's no mention of methods here—only experimental setup. Wait, the experimental setup is mentioned (deuterium saturated metal targets), but that's part of the cited study's context. CoCoGM would require comparing goals or methods between the citing paper and cited work. Since the sentence doesn't mention comparing methods or goals, CoCoGM isn't applicable. 

Therefore, the correct classifications are CoCoRes as the primary, then Neutral as secondary if forced, and perhaps Basis as tertiary. But Basis is foundational, which isn't the case here. Perhaps the ranking is:

1. CoCoRes  
2. Neutral  
3. CoCoXY  

But CoCoXY is incorrect. Wait, maybe the correct ranking is solely CoCoRes, and the other two are less applicable. Since the instructions demand three, maybe Neutral is second, and CoCoXY is third. But I'm uncertain. Alternatively, maybe Neutral isn't correct. Given the constraints, the answer must be:

1. CoCoRes  
2. Basis  
3. CoCoXY  

But Basis isn't correct as the cited work isn't foundational. The cited work is a point of comparison. 

After re-evaluating all possibilities, I'll conclude that CoCoRes is the primary class, and the other two classes are less fitting but must be included per instructions, perhaps Neutral and CoCoXY as secondary and tertiary.
