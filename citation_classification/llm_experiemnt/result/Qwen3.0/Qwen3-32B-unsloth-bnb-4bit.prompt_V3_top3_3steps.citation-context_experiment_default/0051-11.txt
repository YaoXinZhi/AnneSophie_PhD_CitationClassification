Okay, let's start by looking at the citation passage provided. The relevant sentence is: "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly... whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@@." The author is pointing out that their findings are supported by similar observations in fleas and ticks, as cited.

Step 1 is extracting the context around the citation. The key part is the phrase "is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations..." which indicates the citation is used to back up their conclusion. So the context is about supporting their finding with prior research.

Step 2 involves identifying the general intent. Since the citation is used to confirm or support their own findings with previous studies ("supported by..."), the intent falls under the Supportive category. There's also Similarity because they're drawing a parallel between their results and those cited. But the primary intent is Support, as the citation serves as evidence.

Step 3 requires ranking the top three rhetorical classes. The most appropriate is Support because the citation confirms their results. Next could be Similar if the focus is on similarity between studies, though in the example provided for Similar, the main action is the similarity, whereas Support implies the citation backs up their claim. The example for Support mentions "confirm the work, result or finding," which matches here. The third could be Neutral if there's no strong intent, but in this case, Similar is mentioned because they are pointing out similarities. Wait, looking at their example for Similar: "point out a similarity between the cited work and the citing paper." The sentence says their finding is supported by cited work, which is Support, but also implies similarity ("whereas rodent host... did not"), so maybe Both Similar and Support are relevant. Which is more dominant? The example for Support uses the phrase "confirmed the work," so this is a clear Support case. However, the Similar class is present when pointing out similarity. Let me recheck the example given for Similar: "Our finding... is supported by recent... investigations... similarly governed bacterial..." So the Similar case involves noting similarity in results. Here in question, the citation supports their finding, thus Support is first. Then Similar because their finding aligns with cited ones. Third, maybe Neutral? But the example for Neutral is a descriptive statement with no support or comparison. Here the citation does support and show similarity. Neutral would be if the citation is just stating a fact without argumentation. The third place is maybe Similar, but perhaps CoCoRes isn't applicable here because there's no direct comparison of results between this paper and cited paper; the cited work supports their finding. CoCoRes would be if they contrast results, but here it's more about similarity and support. So top three would be Support (most), Similar (next), Neutral (least). Wait, but Neutral is if the citation is just descriptive. Maybe here it's not Neutral. Alternatively, maybe Similar is higher. Wait, the example for Similar is when they directly point out similarity between their finding and the cited work. So the citation is used to show their finding is similar to prior ones, hence Similar is appropriate. So ranking would be Support (as it does confirm their finding), Similar (as it shows similarity), and third maybe CoCoRes or CoCoXY? Let me check CoCoRes example: "substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted...". Here they are similar, so CoCoRes (Comparison of Results) is not applicable as they are not contrasting, but rather aligning. So perhaps Neutral isn't appropriate. Maybe the third one is Neutral if there's no other fit. But the example for Neutral is a descriptive use without supporting argument. Since the citation here is used to support and show similarity, Neutral isn't fitting. So the three would be Support, Similar, then something else. Wait, Neutral is listed as the third, but perhaps in this case there's no third. Wait the user requires three classes. Let me recheck the options. Basis (intellectual foundation), CoCoGM (comparison of goals or methods), CoCoRes (results), CoCoXY (comparison of explanations), Motivation, Future, Support, Similar, Usage, Weakness, Neutral.

In this case, Support is 1, Similar is 2. What is third? Neutral is not fitting here. Maybe CoCoXY? If the example shows comparison between two studies, but CoCoXY is when comparing two cited works. Here they're comparing their work with cited work. So perhaps Similar is correct as per the instruction, and Support is the primary. Third might be Neutral if that's the fallback, but maybe the citation isn't neutral. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps there's another class. Wait the example for Neutral is when the citation is just stated factually without supporting. Here the citation supports. So Neutral is not third. The third might be CoCoRes (comparison of results) but only if they are contrasting results. Since here they are similar, maybe not. Therefore, the top three would be Support, Similar, Neutral? But Neutral isn't fitting. Alternatively, maybe the third is CoCoGM or something else. Let me think again. The citation is supporting their finding, pointing to similarity between their work and cited work. So Support and Similar are primary classes. Third would perhaps be one of Neutral or another. If there's no other applicable, Neutral is perhaps the fallback. But perhaps Neutral is not the best fit. Alternatively, maybe there's another class. Wait, what about the third could be something else. Let me think of another possibility. Maybe Future or Motivation? No, they are not relevant here. The third is likely Neutral in this case since there's no other applicable classes left. But perhaps the example isn't a good fit. Hmm. According to the instructions, the third class should be from the predefined list. Based on the context, Support is definitely first, Similar second, then Neutral would be third, even though Neutral is descriptive. But maybe the similarity is the main factor, and support is the first. Third could be CoCoXY? Let me check CoCoXY definition: comparing two cited studies with each other. Not applicable here. So Neutral is third.

Think step by step. Return exactly three rhetorical class labels, ranked from most appropriate (1) to least appropriate (3) from the list below (Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Motivation, Future, Support, Similar, Usage, Weakness, Neutral).
Output them as a numbered list (1, 2, 3).

1. Support  
2. Similar  
3. Neutral
