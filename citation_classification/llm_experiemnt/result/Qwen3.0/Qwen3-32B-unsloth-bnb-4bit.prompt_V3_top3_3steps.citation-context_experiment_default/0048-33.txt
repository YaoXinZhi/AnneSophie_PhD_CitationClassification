Okay, let's tackle this classification problem step by step. 

First, I need to understand the context around the given citation. The passage mentions that the results of the current study contrast with past findings from specific studies (Lecoq et al., 2011; Saponari et al., 2013). The key sentence is: "These results contrast with past studies that observed high rates of systemic spread of GFLV when grafting to nonhost species (Lecoq et al., 2011; Saponari et al., 2013)."

Next, identifying the general intent. Here, the authors are directly comparing their results with previously reported studies. The phrase "contrast" indicates a comparative intent, which aligns with the Comparative category. According to the instructions, this points to either CoCoRes, CoCoGM, or CoCoXY. 

Now, ranking the specific classes. Since the comparison is about the results of different studies (how findings differ), CoCoRes is the most appropriate. There's also a mention of conflicting results between the cited studies, which hints at CoCoXY being used to compare the cited studies themselves, not the current paper. However, the primary focus here is contrasting the current results with past results, making CoCoRes the top classification. Neutral might come into play if it were just a statement without comparison, but since it's a direct contrast, CoCoXY could be secondary. The third class would likely be Neutral, as the mention of conflicting results among the cited works themselves might be presented in a neutral descriptive manner. 

So, the top three classes are CoCoRes (most relevant), followed by CoCoXY and then Neutral.

1. CoCoRes  
2. CoCoXY  
3. Neutral
