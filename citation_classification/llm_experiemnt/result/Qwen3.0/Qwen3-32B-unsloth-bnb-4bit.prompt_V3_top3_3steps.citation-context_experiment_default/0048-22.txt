Okay, let's see. I need to classify the rhetorical class of the citation given in the scientific passage. Let me start by looking at the passage around the @@CITATION@@.

The sentence is: “Our findings align with previous studies indicating that plant pathogen interactions are crucially influenced by environmental factors @@CITATION@@.” 

So the author is saying their findings match up with earlier studies about plant pathogens and environmental factors. The key word here is "align with," which suggests they're pointing out a similarity between their work and the cited study. 

Looking at the rhetorical class definitions, the Similar class is when the citation points out similarities between the cited work and the citing paper. The Support class is when the citation confirms their findings. The Basis class would be if the citation is foundational. 

In this case, since the author is directly aligning their findings with previous studies, Similar seems most appropriate. Support might also be possible because they're backing their statement with prior work, but the example given in the Similar class closely matches this scenario. 

Then, maybe Neutral could be next if there's no specific argument being made, but since they're using it to show alignment, it's more than just neutral. CoCoRes might not apply here because it's comparing results, but the example for CoCoRes involves direct comparison, and here it's alignment rather than contrasting. 

So top three would likely be Similar, then Support, then Neutral.

1. Similar  
2. Support  
3. Neutral
