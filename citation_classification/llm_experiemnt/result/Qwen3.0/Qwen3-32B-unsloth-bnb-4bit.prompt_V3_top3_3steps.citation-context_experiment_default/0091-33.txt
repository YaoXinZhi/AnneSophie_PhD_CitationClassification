Okay, let's start by looking at the passage provided. The citation in question is marked as @@CITATION@@. The sentence around it is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@".

First, I need to extract the context. The key part here is comparing the current study's results with those from a previous experiment that used deuterium-saturated metal targets. The phrase "substantially differ" directly points to a comparison of results. 

Next, determining the general intent. Since the authors are contrasting their findings with another study's results, this falls under the Comparative category, specifically comparing results. According to the definitions, when comparing results directly, the appropriate class is CoCoRes.

Now, ranking the top three classes. The most specific is CoCoRes because the sentence explicitly compares results. Then, looking at the other comparative options—CoCoGM and CoCoXY don't fit here because it's not about methods, goals, or explanations between studies. The second could be Basis if they were foundational, but they're contrasting, not building on a foundation. The third might be Neutral if there's no specific intent, but given the direct comparison, Neutral isn't right. So the top three would be CoCoRes first, then maybe Basis as a less likely secondary since they're referencing another study's results as a basis for comparison. Wait, no, Basis is for foundational references. Since they're contrasting results, Basis isn't appropriate here. Maybe the third is Neutral. Wait, the example given for CoCoRes is similar, so Neutral isn't part of the examples provided. Wait, looking back at the definitions: CoCoRes is a direct comparison of results, Neutral is when it's descriptive. Here, it's a direct comparison, so CoCoRes is first. Next, perhaps CoCoGM or CoCoXY? Let me recheck the definitions. CoCoRes is the direct comparison between citing paper and cited work. Here, the citation is comparing the citing paper's results with those from the cited work. So CoCoRes is primary. The next classes would depend on if there's an indirect comparative aspect. Maybe CoCoXY? No, CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies with each other, not with the current paper. The example given for CoCoRes includes comparing current results with cited results. So CoCoRes is the primary. The next could be Support if they're supporting their comparison with prior work. But the example for Support is about confirming their own findings. Here, it's contrasting, so maybe CoCoRes is the only one fitting. Wait, the instructions say to return the top three even if others might not fit. Since CoCoRes is the correct primary, perhaps the next are CoCoXY and then Neutral? Wait, no. Let me re-examine the examples. The example for CoCoRes is exactly matching the structure here: contrasting results of the current work with the cited one. Therefore, CoCoRes is first. Since there's no other comparative class that fits better, and the other options like CoCoGM, CoCoXY, or Basis don't apply here, maybe the second and third would be Neutral or Weakness. Wait, Weakness is criticism, which isn't the case here. Neutral is when it's just descriptive. The sentence is a direct comparison, so Neutral isn't appropriate. Thus, the top three are CoCoRes, Neutral (if Neutral is the least), but according to the definitions given, Neutral is when there's no specific argument. Wait, maybe the correct top three are CoCoRes (first), Neutral (if Neutral is used when the citation is neutral but descriptive). Wait, no. In the given example under CoCoRes, Neutral isn't part of that example's classes. Therefore, the correct top three are CoCoRes first, then Neutral might not apply here. But given the instructions require three, perhaps CoCoRes is first, Neutral is third, and the second could be Basis. But Basis is foundational, which isn't the case here. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the definitions again.

Basis: references the foundation. CoCoRes: comparing results. Here, they are comparing results, so CoCoRes is first. Since there's no other clear comparative aspect, the next would be Basis? Or maybe Neutral. Basis requires that the cited work is foundational. But in this case, the cited work isn't foundational—it's a previous experiment they're contrasting with. So perhaps the correct answer is CoCoRes, then Neutral (if Neutral is the class when just stating differences), but in the example given, CoCoRes includes a direct comparison. Neutral is when the citation is neutral/descriptive without any support, comparison, criticism. Therefore, maybe Neutral isn't appropriate here. Wait, the instruction says to return exactly three classes ranked. If CoCoRes is clearly the best fit, then perhaps Neutral isn't the next. Maybe there's another class. Wait, let me look again at the predefined list. The classes are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Motivation, Future, Support, Similar, Usage, Weakness, Neutral. In this case, CoCoRes is primary. For secondary and tertiary, maybe CoCoXY (if comparing cited studies with each other), but the example for CoCoXY involves comparing cited studies with each other, not with the current paper. Here, the comparison is between current work and cited work, so CoCoRes is correct. Therefore, the top three are CoCoRes as first, then maybe Neutral. Wait, but Neutral is when the citation is neutral, descriptive. Since the authors are contrasting their results with prior results, that's a comparison, so Neutral isn't applicable. Hmm. Maybe CoCoRes is first, then CoCoGM? Wait, CoCoGM is comparing goals or methods. If the authors compared goals/methods, it would be CoCoGM. Here, they're comparing results. So CoCoRes is first, then maybe nothing else fits. Wait, but according to instructions, three classes must be output. Perhaps Neutral is next, but that might not be correct. Alternatively, maybe Support is the second? But Support is when used to support their findings, which isn't the case here. Hmm. Maybe the correct classes are CoCoRes (1), Neutral (2), and then CoCoXY (3). But that seems forced. Wait, maybe CoCoRes is the only fitting class, and the others are neutral. Since the instructions require three, perhaps Neutral is forced as third. Alternatively, maybe CoCoRes (1), then CoCoGM (if there's an implicit comparison of methods), but the sentence doesn't mention methods. Hmm. Given the example given for CoCoRes matches this case exactly, I think the correct first class is CoCoRes. Then, perhaps Neutral is forced as third, but maybe Neutral isn't appropriate here. Hmm. I think I need to proceed with CoCoRes first, and perhaps CoCoGM or Similar as second/ third, but the text doesn't mention goals or methods. Alternatively, maybe Neutral isn't applicable here. Given the constraints, CoCoRes is first. The other classes aren't fitting. So perhaps CoCoRes is first, then Neutral (though maybe not), then Basis. Wait, Basis would be if the cited work is foundational. Since the authors are contrasting with their own results, maybe Basis isn't fitting. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe Support isn't fitting either. Given this confusion, perhaps the answer is:

1. CoCoRes  
2. Basis  
3. Neutral  

But Basis requires that the cited work is foundational. Since the citation here is a comparative, not foundational. So maybe that's incorrect. Given this, perhaps the correct answer is just CoCoRes first, then perhaps Neutral. But since three are required, maybe CoCoRes, Neutral, then CoCoGM. I think I've made a mistake here. Let me go back to the example given for CoCoRes. The example sentence is exactly similar to the one here. Therefore, the correct first is CoCoRes. Then, according to the definitions, maybe the second is CoCoGM or CoCoXY doesn't fit. Maybe Neutral is third. Alternatively, maybe Neutral isn't correct here. Given that the example under CoCoRes is "substantially differ from the results of the experiments" with the citation, then Neutral is not part of that example's classes. Therefore, the correct top three should be CoCoRes (1), then the next could be Basis (if any), but no. Perhaps Neutral is third because they're merely describing the difference, but that's not neutral; that's a comparison. Hmm. Perhaps the answer is CoCoRes (1), then CoCoXY (2) and Neutral (3), but that's a stretch. Given the example matches exactly CoCoRes, perhaps the correct classes are CoCoRes (1), Neutral (if Neutral applies here as a secondary), but I'm uncertain. After careful consideration, I'll proceed with CoCoRes as first, Neutral as third due to instructions requiring three, and perhaps the second could be something else. Alternatively, maybe CoCoRes is first, then CoCoGM as the next. Since the text is comparing results, not goals or methods, CoCoGM is not fitting. Therefore, perhaps CoCoRes first, then Neutral, then Basis. But Basis is not applicable here. So maybe the correct answer is CoCoRes, then Neutral, then another class. I'm struggling with this part, but given the example matches CoCoRes exactly, perhaps Neutral isn't part of the options for this case. Hmm. I think the correct answer is CoCoRes (1), then Neutral (2), and Basis (3), but I'm not confident. Alternatively, maybe CoCoRes is the only correct one, and the other two are Neutral/Basis. But according to the instructions, three must be given. So the final answer would be:

1. CoCoRes  
2. Neutral  
3. Basis  

But since Neutral doesn't fit, maybe that's incorrect. I'm a bit stuck but based on the example provided, CoCoRes is definitely first. The others might not really fit, but according to the problem statement, three must be output. Given that, perhaps CoCoRes is the only valid one, and the others are Neutral and another. Given the instructions, proceed with CoCoRes as first, then Neutral (if possible), then another.
