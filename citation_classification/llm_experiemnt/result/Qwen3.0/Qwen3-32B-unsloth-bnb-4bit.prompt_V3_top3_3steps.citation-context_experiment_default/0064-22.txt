Okay, let's tackle this classification. First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage states that the results observed in their study substantially differ from those of experiments using deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @CITATION#. 

Looking at the intent here, they're comparing their results with the cited work's results. According to the classification guidelines, this fits under CoCoRes as it directly contrasts results. 

Next, since they mention substantial differences, maybe there's an implication for future research directions, pointing towards areas where further study is needed. That would suggest Future as a secondary class.

For the third class, Neutral might come into play if they're just stating a differing outcome without deeper critique or support. There's no clear support, criticism, or methodology discussion here, so Neutral could be appropriate.

Now ranking these: CoCoRes is the primary as it's a direct result comparison. Future comes next because suggesting further research based on differing results. Neutral is last if there's no additional motivation or context beyond stating differences.
