Okay, let me try to work through this classification step by step. The task is to determine the top three rhetorical classes for the given citation in the passage. 

First, I need to look at the context around the citation. The user's example passage mentions some research but since the actual context isn't provided here, I'll imagine a typical scenario. Suppose the citation is used to compare results directly. For instance, if the passage says, "Our findings are consistent with previous studies using similar methodologies (Author et al., Year) but differ in certain aspects ( @@CITATION@@ ) because of different sample sizes," then the citation here is pointing out a direct comparison in results. That would fall under CoCoRes (Comparison of Results).

Next, if the citation is also used as an example to contrast claims between two other studies, that could be CoCoXY. For example, if the citation is contrasting two other cited works, not the current paper's own research. However, if the primary comparison is between the current work and the cited one, then CoCoRes is dominant.

If the citation is used to support a conclusion like "As shown in previous research ( @@CITATION@@ ), our results indicate..." that would be Support. But if it's more about showing a similarity in findings without directly supporting the current argument, Similar might fit better.

If there's no strong intent beyond citing a fact without direct support, comparison, or criticism, Neutral could be applicable.

Considering all these, the top three would probably be CoCoRes for direct result comparison, followed by CoCoXY if there's a secondary comparison between citations, and then either Support or Neutral depending on the actual context. Based on the provided examples and definitions, the primary intent could be CoCoRes, then maybe CoCoGM if the goal or method is compared, and Support if there's indirect backing.
