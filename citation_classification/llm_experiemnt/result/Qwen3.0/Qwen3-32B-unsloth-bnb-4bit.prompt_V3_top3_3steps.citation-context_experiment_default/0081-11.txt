Okay, let me try to figure out the rhetorical classes for this citation. The original text around the citation says, "The results from the current study corroborated those presented in a previous research conducted by @@CITATION@@." So first, they're talking about their current study's results matching previous research.

In Step 1, the context is that they corroborated previous results. So the intent here is supportive because they're confirming the work of the cited study. That points towards Support or Similar classes. Support is when the citation is used to back up the current work's findings. Similar is when there's a similarity between the cited work and the citing paper.

Looking at the example for Support: "All subscales were consistent with previous research... also using a U.S. sample..." That's similar because the authors are showing their results align with prior work, just like here. The example for Similar mentions a finding supported by cross-taxon studies, which is about similarity in results, which seems related. 

But wait, in the example given for Support, they reference previous results that confirm their current findings. In the given sentence, corroboration is mutual—both the current study and the cited one present the same results. Does that make it Support or Similar? Support is more about using the cited work to confirm the citing work. Here, it's that their results corroborate each other. Maybe Similar is more appropriate because it's a parallel finding. 

Wait, another angle: if the authors are saying their results corroborate a previous study, that's similar to the Similar example where "our finding... is supported by recent investigations." Wait, in the example given for Similar, the citing paper's findings are supported by the cited work's. But in our case, the current study's results corroborated the cited one's. So perhaps Support is more fitting here because they use the cited work's results as support for their own. 

But the example for Support says "corroborated those presented in a previous research conducted by CITATION". The example in Support says "consistent with previous research... as before..." So maybe Support is correct here. 

Then CoCoRes is when results are compared. The citation could be compared, but since they are corroborating (matching), maybe CoCoRes isn't right. Unless they are contrasting. But here it's confirmation, so likely Support. 

Is there any other class? Basis might be foundation, but here they're using previous work to support their own results. Motivation would be if they cited because there's a problem in previous work. Neutral is descriptive without taking a stance. 

So first candidate is Support. Second might be Similar, if the similarity is mutual. But according to definitions, Support is when citing to confirm their own work. Here, the citing says their results corroborated previous ones. So maybe Support is best. Second could be Similar if it's reciprocal. Wait, Similar example is when the citing paper's findings are similar to the cited one. CoCoRes is when comparing results directly. Maybe CoCoRes is also relevant here. But the example given in CoCoRes says "results substantially differ from..." whereas in the context here, they are the same. So maybe CoCoRes could be considered as comparing or contrasting results, but since it's a positive comparison, Support might override. 

So perhaps the top three are Support, CoCoRes, Similar? Wait, but CoCoRes is for direct comparison. Here it's supporting their work by citing another's results. Maybe Support is first. Then, maybe Basis if they're building on previous work's foundation. But in the example, Basis is about introducing a method or validating something. In the context, if the previous research is foundational for their replication, maybe Basis? But the example has replication of results as Basis. Wait, the Basis example starts with “…validated the IAT by studying biases…” and replicates inoffensive results. The given example in Basis is similar to the context here. So Basis might be a candidate. Wait, but Basis is foundational, meaning the cited work introduced the foundation. However, in this case, the current study corroborates previous results, which might be more Support than Basis. Because Basis is when the cited work is the foundation of the current research, not necessarily that their results align. 

Hmm. Let's re-examine the sentence: "The results from the current study corroborated those presented in a previous research conducted by @@CITATION@." So the current study's results confirm the previous one's. This is a case where the cited work is being used to support the current findings, reinforcing that the current study's results are correct. So that's Support. 

Other possibilities: Could it be Future? No, since they're referencing past work. Motivation? If the previous result was a justification for their study, but here it's a corroboration. Weakness? No. CoCoXY? Comparing two studies? Not mentioned. Usage? Not relevant here. Neutral? If they just mentioned the existence but didn't support. But here they're saying their results corroborate previous ones, which is more than neutral. 

So top three would be Support first. Then maybe Basis if they're replicating a foundational study. Wait, the example for Basis includes replicating results. In that example, the current study replicates previous results for the same purposes. In our case, "corroborated" could imply replication, hence Basis? Hmm. If that's the case, Basis and Support might both apply. 

But according to the definitions, Basis is for foundational references. Support is when confirming the citing authors' work. Here, does the cited study form the foundation, or is it confirming the current work's validity? If the cited work's results are foundational to the current research, then Basis. If the current results support the cited work's findings, then Support. 

Given the sentence structure, it's the current study supporting the previous one's results, reinforcing the previous findings. But in citation analysis, when a paper cites a previous study to show their own results align with previous ones, it's usually Support. The example given in Support aligns with this scenario. 

Therefore, primary class is Support. Then possibly Similar, as mutual similarity. But according to the definition, Similar is about pointing out similarity between the cited and citing paper. Here, they're saying their own results corroborate previous ones, which is similar. So Similar might be second. Then maybe Basis, if it's replicating the foundation. 

Alternatively, Basis might not apply because Basis is more about introducing foundational concepts, not just confirming results. So Basis would be if the cited work introduced a certain method or theory which the current study uses. But here it's about results alignment. 

Therefore, the top three classes would be Support first, Similar second, Neutral third? Or CoCoRes? Wait, CoCoRes is comparison of results, which could be considered here since they're comparing their results with the cited ones. The problem is that CoCoRes implies a direct comparison, either agreement or disagreement. Here it's agreement, so maybe Support and CoCoRes both apply. But the example for CoCoRes is about substantial differences. However, the definition allows for direct comparison regardless of agreement. So CoCoRes could be relevant as they are comparing results. 

But which is more appropriate? The primary intent is support, so Support is first. CoCoRes might be second if it's a comparison. Then maybe Similar is third. Wait, but Similar is also a comparison of similarity between the citing paper's findings and the cited work's. 

Alternatively, maybe Support is first, Similar second, CoCoRes third. Need to check definitions again. 

Wait the example given in Support says "consistent with previous research... also using a U.S. sample", which is confirming their findings with previous. The example in Similar is when their finding is supported by a similar study's findings. 

So perhaps Similar is about a similarity between the current study and the cited work. In this case, current corroborated previous results, which is a similarity. So Support is about supporting the current study's validity through prior work, while Similar is pointing out a similarity between the two. So maybe both apply here. But according to the instructions, need to pick top three. 

So perhaps Support is first, Similar second, CoCoRes third. But I think CoCoRes is a comparison of results, which applies here. Since they mention their results corroborating previous ones, it's a comparison. Thus CoCoRes would be included. So maybe Support first, CoCoRes second, Similar third. But the example for Support is similar to the context. 

Alternatively, maybe Support is the main one. Because the primary intent is that the authors are supporting their current findings by citing corroborating prior research. So first is Support. The second candidate could be Similar, as they're showing similarity. Third might be Basis if they're building on previous work's results as a foundation. 

But Basis is foundation. In the example for Basis, it's replicating previous results for the same purposes, which could be seen as foundational. Here, if corroboration is part of replication, then Basis could be second. 

Putting it all together, maybe Support is first, Basis second, Similar third. Wait, but Basis is about foundational. The cited work might be foundational here if the current study is replicating previous. Alternatively, Support is more accurate. 

I think the correct classes here are Support, CoCoRes, and Similar. Support as the primary, CoCoRes as comparing results, and Similar as indicating a similarity. But based on definitions, Support is about confirmation, CoCoRes is direct comparison. Since CoCoRes can be positive or negative comparison, and Similar is about pointing out similarity between cited and citing work's findings. 

Alternatively, maybe Support is first, Similar second, CoCoRes third if the comparison is between results. 

Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous, but based on the example provided in Support matching the context closely, Support should be first. The CoCoRes might come into play if they're contrasting or comparing their results in a more analytical way. Since here it's agreement, maybe support is primary, and Similar or CoCoRes could be secondary. 

Given all that, I think the top three are Support, CoCoRes, and Similar. Maybe in that order. Wait, but perhaps CoCoRes is only when comparing cited works with the citing paper's results, which is exactly what Support does. So perhaps CoCoRes is redundant with Support here. 

Alternatively, maybe CoCoRes isn't needed. In this case, the citation isn't comparing between the current and cited paper's results in a direct analysis, but confirming them. So maybe Support is first, and then Similar as reciprocal similarity. Basis could also be considered if it's replication. 

After re-reading the instructions, Basis is when the cited work is the foundation. Support is confirming with prior research. So in this case, Support is the best fit, maybe followed by Similar. Third could be Basis if it's foundational. 

Given the example in Basis is replication, perhaps Basis could be relevant here as well. 

Final conclusion: The top three rhetorical classes are Support, Basis, and CoCoRes.
