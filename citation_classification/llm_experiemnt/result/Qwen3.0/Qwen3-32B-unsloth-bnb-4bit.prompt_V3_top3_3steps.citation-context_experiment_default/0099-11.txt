Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. The citation in question is @@CITATION@@.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage says, "However, recent studies have suggested that some of these methods might lead to unintended systemic effects @@CITATION@@ which could impact long-term plant health outcomes." 

The general intent here seems to be critical, pointing out potential issues with certain methods mentioned in the cited work. The phrase "might lead to unintended systemic effects" suggests a limitation or flaw in the cited studies. 

Looking at the rhetorical classes, the primary class appears to be Weakness since the citation is used to question or point out limitations in the cited work. CoCoRes could be secondary since it's contrasting results or findings. Neutral might come in third if the citation is just descriptive, but given the critical tone, Weakness is more fitting. CoCoXY doesn't seem relevant here because it's not comparing two cited studies.
