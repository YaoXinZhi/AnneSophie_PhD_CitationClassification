Okay, let's tackle this classification problem step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the cited paper. The example given mentions a comparison of experiments involving different methods. The text says "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets..." which directly compares findings.

Next, the general intent here seems to be a comparative analysis focusing on results, so CoCoRes is a strong candidate. There's also a mention of conflicting results in another context, which hints at a Comparative Explanations or Claims aspectâ€”maybe CoCoXY. However, since the example contrasts the cited work's experiments with the current results, the primary class here is CoCoRes. The Neutral class might come in if there's descriptive content without taking a stance, but the example seems more about direct contrast. I don't see a Motivation or Support here. Usage or Weakness also don't fit. The most fitting classes would be CoCoRes as the primary, perhaps followed by CoCoXY if comparing explanations, and Neutral last due to descriptive elements not being prominent. But the example is more about result comparison, so Neutral might not be necessary here. Let me recheck the definitions to ensure accuracy.

1. CoCoRes  
2. CoCoXY  
3. Neutral
