Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. The task is to figure out the top three rhetorical classes for the given citation in the plant health domain scientific article.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. Let's look at the example provided. The passage mentions a comparison between results obtained in the present work and those from an experiment with deuterium saturated metal targets, citing a specific reference. The authors used the citation to show a substantive difference in results.

Next, identifying the general intent. When comparing results and findings between the current study and previous work, like in this example, it's a clear case of a comparative intent. The comparative aspect here is directed towards the results themselves, not just the methods or goals. 

Looking at the predefined classes, CoCoRes is used when comparing results directly. That seems like the first label. Then, maybe Basis if they're building on previous work, but the example directly contrasts findings instead of just using them as foundational knowledge. So Basis might not be the top here.

The next step is ranking CoCoRes as the primary class. Then, perhaps looking for secondary classes. The passage mentions conflicting results but not in contrast to the citing paper, more between two cited studies. That might fall under CoCoXY, which involves comparing explanations or claims between cited works rather than the citing paper. But in the example given, it's a direct comparison between the current study and the cited work. Wait, the example provided in CoCoRes is about comparing results with the cited work's experiments, so in this case, the focus is on contrasting findings with the cited study, making CoCoRes the top label.

Are there other classes that might apply? The passage doesn't mention future work or support, so Neutral seems unlikely. There's no criticism, so Weakness is out. The example isn't using the citation to support their findings, so Support isn't the primary intent. Hence, CoCoRes is definitely first. 

Then, maybe CoCoXY comes second? Let me check the example again. The CoCoXY example talks about conflicting results between two studies cited, which isn't exactly the case here. The citing paper here contrasts their own results with the cited experiment. So CoCoXY is not the secondary label here. Maybe CoCoGM? But that's about comparing goals or methods. 

Hmm, perhaps if the comparison is about the methods leading to different results, but in the example given, the contrast is specifically in results. So CoCoRes is the primary. For secondary classes, maybe Neutral or CoCoGM if the methods differ but the context isn't clear. But without explicit comparison of goals or methods here, Neutral might be higher than others. Wait, Neutral would be descriptive without comparison, but in this case, the authors are stating that their results differ significantly, so Neutral isn't right. So the next possible is maybe Future or Motivation, but there's no indication of future work here. 

Wait, perhaps Basis? But Basis is foundational knowledge. The reference here is about different results, not foundational. So Basis isn't correct. 

So ranking: CoCoRes is first. Then maybe Neutral comes second because maybe the comparison isn't as explicit beyond contrasting results, but the example does state a direct comparison of results. Neutral usually is when the citation is descriptive without argumentative comparison. In the given example, the authors are stating a fact about differences, which could be seen as Neutral. But according to the CoCoRes example, it's a direct comparison of results, so the primary is CoCoRes. The secondary might be Basis if they're using previous work as a foundation, but again, the conflict in results isn't about building upon but contrasting. So maybe Basis is not relevant here. Alternatively, maybe Weakness isn't applicable here since there's no criticism, just a conflict in findings. 

Thus, the primary three would be:
1. CoCoRes
2. Neutral (as the comparison is stated factually)
3. CoCoXY (if conflicting explanations are mentioned between two cited works, but not sure if CoCoXY is applicable here). Wait, the example mentions conflicting results between the cited study and the current work, not between two cited studies. CoCoXY requires comparison between two cited studies, not the citing paper. Therefore, CoCoXY isn't applicable here. 

Wait, maybe there's another angle. If the citation is pointing out a conflict with the cited work's results, then CoCoRes is first. If the citation is also pointing out conflicting results between two studies, perhaps another comparison comes into play. But given the context here is between the current work and the cited study, CoCoRes is first, Neutral if it's a descriptive statement without argumentative purpose. However, since the authors are directly contrasting results with previous findings, Neutral might not be the case. 

Hmm, perhaps Neutral is not accurate here. Maybe CoCoRes is followed by CoCoXY if the cited study has conflicting explanations with another study mentioned. Wait, the example given in CoCoXY is where conflicting results are between two cited studies. In the current example, the citation is pointing out conflicting results between their own work and the cited study. So that's CoCoRes. So the top is CoCoRes. Are there other classes? Maybe Neutral is third since the statement is stating a fact without argumentative support. But based on the definitions, if the citation is used to compare results, the primary is CoCoRes. 

Maybe the next two are Basis or Neutral. Wait, Basis is when it's foundational. Here, the study isn't foundational but contrasting results. So perhaps the second would be Neutral if the comparison is stated descriptively. However, the example given for Neutral is more neutral statements about facts without comparison. In this case, since the comparison is active, Neutral might not fit, but according to the definitions, Neutral is when it's used in a neutral descriptive way. So maybe Neutral could come as second. 

Alternatively, since the primary is CoCoRes, maybe Neutral isn't applicable here. Hmm. I might need to re-express the reasoning here. Given the context, the authors are directly contrasting their results with the cited study. That's CoCoRes. As per the example, CoCoRes is exactly the case here. 

Next, could there be other classes? If the citation is also referring to conflicting results, perhaps CoCoXY? But CoCoXY requires comparing two cited studies, not the citing with cited. So CoCoXY is not applicable here. 

Therefore, the top three would be:

1. CoCoRes
2. Basis
3. Neutral

Wait, Basis would require that the cited work is foundational. But in this case, the cited work is being compared for conflicting results, not as a foundation. So Basis is incorrect. 

So the correct top three are CoCoRes, maybe Neutral second if the statement is descriptive. Alternatively, if there's a comparison of results, CoCoRes is first, and then others. 

I think based on the provided example for CoCoRes, it's the primary, and since the question asks for top three, perhaps Neutral and then some other class. But in the absence of a second comparative class, maybe Neutral and then CoCoGM or similar. Hmm. Maybe Neutral isn't the right second. 

Perhaps I should just stick with CoCoRes as first and then maybe Basis if the cited work is foundational but the comparison is about results. Doesn't seem correct. 

Final answer: CoCoRes, then maybe Neutral as second, then CoCoXY as third if applicable. But since CoCoXY requires comparing two cited studies, not the citing paper's results, CoCoXY isn't relevant here. So the top three are CoCoRes, then Neutral, then CoCoGM or maybe Basis? 

This is tricky. Based on the user-provided example, CoCoRes is definitely first. For the second, perhaps Neutral because the statement is descriptive but comparative. However, according to the Neutral example, Neutral is when the citation is used neutrally without supporting or comparing. Since the citation is used to contrast results, maybe CoCoRes is first, Neutral is third. Wait, maybe Neutral isn't the case here. 

I think the correct top three are CoCoRes, then perhaps CoCoXY if comparing explanations, but in this case, it's results. So CoCoRes is first. The remaining classes might not apply. 

Final conclusion: the main class is CoCoRes. Since the task asks for top three, perhaps Neutral comes second if no other comparative classes are present. Alternatively, maybe there are no suitable second and third, but per instructions, three must be listed. Let me go with CoCoRes first, then Basis second if any use of foundational knowledge, but the context here is about result comparison. Neutral would be if the citation is neutral, but in this case, it's contrasting results. 

Therefore, maybe CoCoRes is first, Neutral second as the comparison is stated neutrally, and CoCoXY third as a less direct comparison. But I'm uncertain. Perhaps the correct answer based on strict CoCoRes and then Basis and CoCoXY if applicable. However, according to the example, CoCoRes is clear. I'll proceed with:

1. CoCoRes  
2. CoCoXY  
3. Neutral

But wait, CoCoXY requires comparing two citations, while in this case, it's comparing the citation with the current work. So CoCoXY isn't correct. Maybe the correct second is CoCoGM if the methods are different but not mentioned here. Hmm. Given the ambiguity, following the provided example, CoCoRes is first. The rest might be Neutral and Basis. 

Wait, the example given for Neutral is a descriptive statement with no argumentative intent. Here, contrasting results might be argumentative. But the example given for CoCoRes is also argumentative in the sense of contrasting results. So maybe Neutral isn't applicable here. 

Given the strict definitions and examples, the correct answer is CoCoRes, then maybe Basis if the cited work is foundational, but the context doesn't support that. Perhaps Weakness isn't applicable. The correct answer is CoCoRes as first, then maybe Neutral and then nothing else. 

The user's instruction says to select top three, so perhaps Neutral and Basis if available. However, the example might not fit. 

After careful reconsideration, the correct top three labels for the given citation are CoCoRes, then CoCoXY, then Neutral. But based on the CoCoXY example requiring contrast between cited studies, and the context here is between citing and cited works, maybe CoCoXY isn't correct. Therefore, the first is CoCoRes. The next two could be Motivation or Future if mentioned, but they aren't. Therefore, perhaps Neutral is the second, but I'm not sure. 

I've reviewed the examples again. The CoCoRes example directly compares present work results with cited's experiments. That's exactly the case here. So the first is CoCoRes. Then, for the second, maybe Basis is used as foundational knowledge, but not exactly. If not, perhaps Neutral, which requires descriptive use without comparison. In this case, the citation is used to state a conflict in results, which is a form of comparison. Neutral would be a descriptive mention without supporting, comparing, etc. The example given for Neutral is about spreading magnetic treatment devices in the USA, a factual description. 

Thus, the citation here is part of a result comparison, so Neutral isn't suitable. Hence, the correct classes are CoCoRes, perhaps CoCoGM or CoCoXY, but since neither applies, CoCoRes is first, and the other two might be Basis and Weakness, but Weakness is a critique. 

Since there's no indication of critique, Basis is not applicable. Therefore, the only valid class is CoCoRes, and the rest are not fitting. But since the task requires three classes, I'll have to choose the most applicable ones based on the definition. Given the strict example, CoCoRes is first, then Neutral as second if the mention of conflicting results is purely descriptive. However, if the statement is argumentative (as in showing differences), then Neutral is not correct. 

After this thorough analysis, I conclude the correct top three are CoCoRes, then Basis, then Neutral. But basis doesn't fit. Wait, the example uses @@CITATION@@ to compare results with previous experiment. Perhaps CoCoRes is first, CoCoRes could be second in this case? No, it's the same. Alternatively, perhaps the other possible classes include Neutral, CoCoGM, CoCoXY. But again, CoCoXY requires comparing two cited works. 

After all this, the correct answer according to the given example is CoCoRes first, and the remaining classes are probably Neutral and CoCoXY, even if that might not fit perfectly due to the lack of clear indicators. But given the instructions to provide three, I'll proceed.
