Okay, let's start by looking at the context around the citation. The sentence says, "Our results are consistent with prior studies showing that resistance to citrus canker is enhanced in certain citrus cultivars @@CITATION@." The mention of "consistent with prior studies" suggests that the cited work supports their findings.

The general intent here seems to be supportive, so the class would fall under Support. Support is when the citation is used to confirm the work or findings of the citing authors. Another possibility is Similar, since it's pointing out consistency. But the example given for Support includes phrases like "consistent with previous research," which matches this context better.

Is there any comparison here? It might be a comparison in terms of results, but the example for CoCoRes mentions contrasting results. However, the sentence here doesn't contrast but rather aligns with prior studies. So CoCoRes might not fit. Maybe the context is more about support and similarity in findings.

Looking at Neutral, but the citation here is used to back up the statement, so Neutral is less likely. Basis is about foundational aspects, which isn't the case here. Motivation or Future don't apply either since the citation is about existing support, not motivating future research or addressing knowledge gaps.

So top three would be Support first, Similar second, and maybe CoCoRes third if there's any indirect comparison. But given the examples, Support seems the most accurate, then Similar, then perhaps Neutral if it's more descriptive, but in this case, since it's supporting, Neutral might rank lower. Wait, maybe CoCoXY isn't relevant here because it's comparing explanations between cited studies. The example for Similar mentions "point out a similarity," which aligns with "results are consistent." So between Support and Similar. Looking at the Support example, it says "as before, participants did not distinguish..." which is similar. The example for Support here supports their results by citing prior work. The user's sentence uses "consistent with prior studies," so Support is a fit. Similar would be if they point out the similarity of results. So perhaps Support and Similar both apply here.

But according to definitions, Support is when the citation supports the citing authors' work. The sentence says their results are consistent with prior studies, which is supporting their findings. Support is the most appropriate. Then Similar if they mention similarity in results, and maybe Neutral if it's just a factual citation. But given the phrasing, Support is primary, Similar secondary, Neutral third maybe? Or perhaps Neutral isn't the third. Let me check again. Neutral is when it's descriptive without supporting. Here, the citation is used to support their consistency claim. So Neutral wouldn't be right. Maybe the third is CoCoRes as a comparison, but the example for CoCoRes involves contrasting results. The sentence here doesn't do that. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's just Support and Similar. But the user asked for three classes. Let me see the example given for Support: it directly supports their subscales by citing previous research. So Support is definitely the first. Similar comes from the phrase "results are consistent," indicating similarity. Then maybe Neutral is third? Wait, but if the citation is used in a neutral descriptive way, but here it's still supporting. Hmm. Perhaps the third is Similar. Alternatively, maybe CoCoRes if they compare their results to cited ones. But the example of CoCoRes is direct comparison. Here, the authors state their results are consistent, which is a similarity, so Similar is better. Maybe the third could be CoCoXY if comparing two cited studies, but there's no mention of two studies here. The example given for Neutral is a descriptive citation without supporting or motivating. But in this case, the citation is supporting their claim of consistency. So Neutral wouldn't fit. Therefore, the top three would be Support, Similar, Neutral? But Neutral might not apply here. Alternatively, maybe Similar is the primary, Support secondary, and then CoCoXY or CoCoRes. Wait, I think I'm getting confused here. Let me refer back to the definitions. Support is when the citation confirms or supports the citing authors' work. Similar is pointing out a similarity between cited work and the citing paper. In the example sentence, the authors say their results are consistent with prior studies, which is similar findings. So both Support and Similar might both be applicable. But according to the example given for Support: "participants did not distinguish between..." which is similar findings. The example for Similar mentions "our finding is supported... also using a U.S. sample," which is similar findings. Wait, maybe Support is when using previous studies as support for their results, which is what the example shows. In the user's context, they state their results are consistent with prior studies, which is using those studies as support. Therefore, Support is the primary. Then Similar is secondary because they mention similarity. Neutral might not apply here. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe Neutral is the third if there's no clear supporting intent. But in the given example of Support, it's exactly that scenario. Therefore, the top three classes would be Support, Similar, Neutral? Or perhaps Support, Similar, CoCoRes? Hmm. Let me re-examine. Since their results are consistent with prior, that's supporting their work by citing previous study's results—Support. Also, pointing out similarity between their findings and cited findings—Similar. CoCoRes would be if they contrast results, but here they are consistent, so not contrast. So Support (1), Similar (2), CoCoRes might not apply. But the user expects exactly three classes. Alternatively, if Neutral is third. Maybe Neutral isn't right here. I think based on the definitions, Support is the most accurate, followed by Similar, CoCoRes might not apply here. Neutral is when it's just a factual mention without supporting or anything else. So the final list would be Support first, Similar second, Neutral third.
