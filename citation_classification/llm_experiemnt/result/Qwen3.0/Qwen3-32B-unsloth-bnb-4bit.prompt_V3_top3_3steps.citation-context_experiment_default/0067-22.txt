Okay, let's start by looking at the context around the citation marked @@CITATION@@ in the given scientific passage. The relevant sentence says, “The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@.” 

The key phrase here is “substantially differ from the results of the experiments,” which indicates that the authors are comparing their findings with those of a previous study. The purpose here is to highlight how their results contrast with existing results. According to the definitions provided, the CoCoRes class is used when citations are employed to compare or contrast the results or findings of the cited work with the current study.

Now, considering the general intent of this citation. The main goal isn't foundational (Basis), because they're not building upon the cited work's foundation. It's also not motivational or suggesting future work (Motivation/Future). The citation isn't supporting their own results by referencing another study's findings (Support) but instead contrasting them. Therefore, CoCoRes seems most fitting here.

Next, we check for other potential classes. Could this be CoCoGM? That involves comparing goals or methods, but the sentence refers to results, not methods or goals, so CoCoGM isn't appropriate. CoCoXY is for comparing two cited studies, which isn't the case here. Neutral would imply a non-specific mention, but the citation is clearly being used for a direct comparison of results. 

Weakness or Criticism isn't indicated since the sentence doesn't express a flaw in the cited study, just a difference in results. Therefore, the primary rhetorical class is CoCoRes.

To find the secondary and tertiary classes, consider any related categories. There might be a slight similarity (Similar) angle if they imply similarity but contrast in context. However, CoCoRes remains dominant. Neutral could be secondary if there's neutrality, but here it's an explicit comparison of results. So CoCoRes is first, then possibly Neutral (as results are being compared rather than results of their own being supported), and lastly CoCoXY if any contrast among cited works is implied, which isn't the case here.

So the ranking is CoCoRes as first, followed by Neutral as a close second, and perhaps Support if there is any implicit support, but no direct support is stated.
