Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the three most appropriate rhetorical classes for the citation marked @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. The user hasn't provided the actual passage, but based on the example given in the definitions, I can assume a scenario.

Wait, actually, the user probably expects me to apply this process to a specific example they might provide. Since the example here is about a scientific article discussing plant health, maybe something like comparing results or methods between studies. Let me think of a sample sentence where @@CITATION@@ is placed. For example, imagine a sentence like: "The effectiveness of the new fungicide was demonstrated in our study, contrasting with previous results shown in @@CITATION@@", where they mention their findings are different from an earlier study.

Step 1 would be extracting the context around @@CITATION@@. Let's say the extracted context is "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@", similar to the example provided for CoCoRes.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. If the citation is used to compare results between the current work and the cited work, that's comparative. So the intent would be Comparative â†’ CoCoRes.

Step 3: Assign specific classes. The main one here would be CoCoRes. If there's also a mention of contrasting explanations or another comparison between two studies, maybe CoCoXY. But if the example is only comparing current paper's results with the cited work's results, then CoCoRes is primary. Secondary could be CoCoXY if another study is mentioned too. If not, maybe Support if they're supporting by contrasting. Wait, the example given for CoCoRes is comparing their results with cited experiments, so in that case, CoCoRes is the main class. Then perhaps Neutral if there's no further analysis. Wait, Neutral is when the citation is neutral. If the comparison is direct, CoCoRes is first. If the example contrasts results without further critique, maybe CoCoRes is first, then perhaps Support or Similar if the context allows. Hmm. The sample example in CoCoRes' explanation is a direct comparison of results, so CoCoRes would be first. The Neutral might come if there's no additional intent beyond stating the comparison. Wait, the Neutral example is a citation that's just describing something without argumentation. So in this case, if the citation is used to compare results directly, CoCoRes is top, then maybe CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two cited studies, but since the example is comparing current work, maybe CoCoRes is first, similar comes next if there's a similarity noted alongside. Alternatively, if the comparison is just contrast of results, CoCoRes would be primary, maybe followed by something else if there's more context. But without additional info, maybe CoCoRes is first. Then Neutral if the rest is just stating facts. Wait, maybe the example given in CoCoRes would have CoCoRes as 1, then Neutral if the rest is descriptive. Wait, Neutral is when the citation is used descriptively without supporting, comparing, etc. So if the citation is comparing results, that's CoCoRes, not Neutral. So perhaps after CoCoRes, maybe similar classes like CoCoXY if two studies are compared. Wait, CoCoXY is when comparing two cited studies with each other, not with current work. In the example given for CoCoXY, they mention conflicting results between two cited studies. So if the context here is comparing current work with cited work, it's CoCoRes. If only comparing cited works, CoCoXY. Based on the example given in CoCoRes, then CoCoRes is the main class, maybe CoCoXY as a secondary if the cited work is part of a larger comparison between studies. Alternatively, maybe Neutral comes third if there's no further intent. Hmm. Wait, maybe the top three would be CoCoRes, then Neutral if there's no direct comparison beyond the stated result. Alternatively, if the sentence also uses the citation as a foundation for further work, maybe Basis or Motivation. But in the example given for CoCoRes, the intent is purely comparative. So the main classes would be CoCoRes, Neutral might come third if the rest is neutral. Wait, perhaps the top classes are CoCoRes (1), Neutral (2?), but Neutral usually isn't a comparison. Hmm, perhaps the top three are CoCoRes, then maybe Support if the cited work is used to support their comparison. Wait, in the example given in CoCoRes: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets... @@CITATION@@", the intent here is to compare results directly, so CoCoRes is first. Then maybe similar classes would be if there's a similarity mentioned elsewhere, but if not, perhaps Neutral or something else. Alternatively, perhaps Basis if the cited work is foundational but in the example it's more comparative. Hmm. Maybe the top three are CoCoRes, Basis, Neutral? Or maybe Basis isn't applicable here. Without further context, it's tricky. Based strictly on the example given in CoCoRes, the correct order would be CoCoRes first. If there's no other clear indicators, then perhaps Neutral as second if the citation is described neutrally beyond the comparison. Wait, Neutral is when the citation is used descriptively without comparing. So if the citation is comparing results between current work and cited, CoCoRes is first. Then if another part of the sentence is descriptive, maybe Neutral. But if the citation's context is entirely comparative, Neutral wouldn't be a top class. Hmm. In the absence of more context, perhaps the top three are CoCoRes, followed by something else if possible. Wait, in the user's example output, they might expect something like 1.CoCoRes, 2. CoCoXY, 3. Neutral. But if the context is directly comparing the current study's results to cited work's results, CoCoRes is primary. If also there's a mention of comparing to another study's explanations, CoCoXY comes next. If not, maybe another class like Basis. But without specific context, I need to rely on the examples given. Let me stick to the example provided for CoCoRes. The example sentence uses CoCoRes to compare results directly. So in that case, CoCoRes is first. Neutral would be if the citation is neutrally mentioned without comparison. If the example's citation is part of a comparative statement, Neutral isn't appropriate. Hmm. This is confusing. Maybe the example's top classes would be CoCoRes, then maybe another CoCoXY if two studies are compared. For example, in the CoCoXY example, the authors compare conflicting results between two other studies. So in that case, CoCoXY would be first. If the citation in question is part of a comparison with current work's results, CoCoRes is first. Then perhaps Neutral or something else. Without more context, maybe the answer is CoCoRes, Neutral, and Basis? Not sure. Wait, maybe the correct top three here are CoCoRes, similar to Basis if the cited work's results form the basis of their study. But in the example given, it's more direct comparison than foundational. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps Basis is not applicable here. This is challenging without looking at the actual context. Based on the user's example output, perhaps it's CoCoRes first. If the context is comparing results between current and cited studies, then CoCoRes is first. Maybe Neutral comes third if the rest of the sentence is descriptive. Alternatively, maybe Basis isn't applicable. Hmm. I'll proceed as per the example given in CoCoRes, where the main classification is CoCoRes, and maybe Neutral if the citation is used in a neutral descriptive way beyond the comparison. Wait, Neutral is when it's descriptive without any argumentation. If the citation is used to compare results, it's not neutral. So perhaps Neutral isn't appropriate here. Maybe the next possible classes are CoCoXY if two cited studies are compared, Basis if it's foundational, or Motivation if the cited work motivates the current research. In the example given in CoCoRes, the citation is contrasting results, so CoCoRes is primary. If Motivation isn't present here, maybe Basis or Similar. Hmm. This is getting a bit tangled. To recap: if the citation is used to compare results between current work and cited work, CoCoRes is first. If there's additional context pointing to other comparisons like between two cited studies, CoCoXY would be second. Neutral might come third if any part of the sentence is neutral, but the citation context is comparative. So maybe CoCoRes is 1, then perhaps another comparative class if applicable, or Basis. Alternatively, perhaps Basis is not relevant. Given the example provided in CoCoRes, the correct answer would be CoCoRes first. Without additional context, I'll proceed with that example.
