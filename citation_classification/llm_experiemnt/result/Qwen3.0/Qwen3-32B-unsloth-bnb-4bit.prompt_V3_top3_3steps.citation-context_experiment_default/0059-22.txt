Okay, let's start by looking at the citation passage where @@CITATION@@ is placed. The relevant sentence is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." 

First, I need to extract the context. The author is directly comparing their own results with those from a previous study using deuterium targets. The key phrase here is "substantially differ," which signals a comparison of findings. 

Next, determining the general intent. Since they're contrasting their results with the cited work's results, this points towards a Comparative category. Specifically, the example under CoCoRes matches this scenario where the current study's results are compared directly to those in the citation.

Looking at the options, CoCoRes is the primary class here. There's also a mention of the cited experiments, but it's about results, not goals or methods, so CoCoGM isn't right. The citation isn't used to support their own work or justify future steps, so Basis and Future are out. Neutral is incorrect because there's an active comparison happening. 

As for the third most appropriate, maybe Neutral if there's a descriptive mention elsewhere, but in this case, the entire context is about contrasting results, so Neutral isn't fitting here. The top three would be CoCoRes first, perhaps CoCoXY if they were comparing explanations between two studies, but in this case, it's only between the cited study and the citing paper. Wait, CoCoRes is when comparing the citing paper's results with the cited work, which is exactly the case here. The example provided under CoCoRes is "the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted..." So CoCoRes is definitely first. 

Then, maybe Support if there's some supporting elements, but the sentence is contrasting results, not supporting. Neutral could be third if there's another part of the citation passage that's neutral, but the given context doesn't show that. So perhaps Weakness if the citation is being critiqued, but here it's just stating a difference. 

Given the definitions, CoCoRes is the primary. Then maybe Neutral or CoCoGM as second, but there's no mention of goals or methods here. Wait, perhaps CoCoXY isn't applicable since it's not comparing two other studies but the citing paper's own results with the cited study. So the top three would be CoCoRes first, then perhaps Neutral if there's any neutral mention, but in this case, the main point is the contrast. So the secondary could be something else. But given the options, after CoCoRes, maybe CoCoXY isn't right, Motivation isn't applicable, Basis isn't either. So maybe CoCoRes is first, Neutral second if parts of the citation are just background, but the example provided doesn't show that. Hmm. 

Looking back, the sentence is straightforwardly stating that their results differ from the previous, so it's a direct comparison of results. CoCoRes is the primary. The third could be Basis if the cited work is foundational, but the example given in Basis mentions introducing and validating a method, which isn't the case here. Neutral might apply if there's a general mention without critique or support. Since the sentence is stating a contrast without implying a problem, Weakness might not be right. So Neutral could be third. But the example under Neutral is something like stating a fact without any argument. In this case, stating a difference is not exactly neutral, but part of the CoCoRes. Wait, the Neutral example is more like descriptive usage without taking sides. However, in CoCoRes, the citation is used to compare results, which is exactly what the example given does. Therefore, the top class is CoCoRes. The second could be something else if present, but based on the passage, maybe Neutral isn't fitting here. Maybe Weakness if they are pointing out a limitation, but they are just stating a difference. Therefore, the top three would be CoCoRes first, then maybe Basis if the cited work is foundational. Wait, the example under Basis is about introducing and validating a method. Here, the cited work conducted experiments, but it's their results that differ. So Basis could be second if their own research is building upon the cited work. But the intent here isn't foundational but comparative. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe CoCoRes is first, then Neutral as the cited work's results are mentioned in a neutral fashion as part of the comparison. Then perhaps Basis is not applicable here. The second best could be Basis if the cited work forms the foundation for the comparison, but the example given in Basis is when the cited work introduced a method that's replicated. Here, the cited work's experiments are used for comparison, so Basis isn't the primary intent. The most appropriate is CoCoRes, second could be something else if there's a secondary intent. 

Wait, maybe CoCoRes is the primary. Then, perhaps Neutral is third if any part of the citation is just background, but the sentence is about differences, making Weakness irrelevant. Since Weakness is about criticizing, but here it's just stating a contrast. So Weakness is not applicable. Then maybe the third is Neutral, which is when the citation is used descriptively without any argument. But in the case given, the citation is used to directly compare results, which is part of CoCoRes. However, maybe after CoCoRes, the next possible is Basis if the cited work provides foundational context. If the cited work is forming the basis for their current study's comparison, then Basis could be second. But the example under Basis is when the cited work introduced the method, which isn't the case here. Here, the cited work's experiments are compared, but they aren't foundational unless mentioned as such elsewhere. Without additional context, it's safer to stick with CoCoRes as first. 

Then perhaps Neutral as second because the citation is mentioned in a neutral way when stating differences. Wait, noâ€”if the citation is used to show a contrast, it's not neutral. Neutral is when there's no argumentation. Therefore, after CoCoRes, maybe Weakness is third if the work is criticized, but the sentence doesn't do that. Therefore, CoCoRes is first, and the next two might be less appropriate. But according to the instruction, we need to output three classes. Given the example given in CoCoRes matches the scenario, CoCoRes is first. The second could be something else like CoCoGM if there's a method comparison, but the example mentions different metal targets as part of the experiments, which would be methods. Wait, the cited work's method is using deuterium saturated metal targets, and the citing paper's experiments differ. Is that CoCoGM? Because if they're comparing methods, then CoCoGM might apply. Wait, the current work's methods differ from those using deuterium targets, leading to different results. So maybe the comparison is both results and methods. Then CoCoGM could be second if the methods are compared. But the sentence says the results differ from experiments conducted with the use of deuterium targets. However, the cited work's methods involved deuterium targets. If the citing paper is contrasting their methods with the cited paper's methods, then CoCoGM would apply. But in the sentence given, the emphasis is on differing results. But perhaps the differing methods are mentioned (deuterium saturated), implying that the methods are different, leading to different results. However, the sentence structure says "the present work's results differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium..." So the comparison is on results (CoCoRes), and possibly the methods are part of why the results differ. But according to the CoCoRes example, it's a direct comparison of results. Therefore, CoCoRes is first. 

Now, considering the options, CoCoRes is definitely first. The second might be CoCoGM if methods are compared, but the sentence's primary focus is results. The third could be Basis if the cited work is foundational to the current research's methodology. But again, the example under Basis is about introducing and validating a method that the current work replicates. Here, it's a comparison of results, not building upon a foundation. So perhaps Basis isn't applicable. Neutral would be if the citation is just descriptive, but since the citation is part of a comparison, it's not neutral. Therefore, after CoCoRes, maybe Weakness is third if there's an implication that the cited work's results are flawed because of their methods (using deuterium targets). However, the sentence states that results differ but doesn't criticize them as flawed. Weakness requires pointing out limitations, which isn't done here. Therefore, Weakness isn't applicable. 

Given that, the top three would be CoCoRes first, then maybe CoCoXY if comparing two cited studies, but the example under CoCoXY involves comparing two studies to each other, not the citing paper with the cited work. Therefore, CoCoXY isn't applicable here. 

The remaining option for second could be Similar if there's any similarity mentioned, but the sentence says "substantially differ," which is the opposite. Therefore, Similar is out. Motivation isn't applicable since it's not about justifying the research. Future isn't either. Usage isn't relevant here since there's no mention of using methods from the cited work. Support isn't applicable since the current work's results differ from the cited ones and aren't supported by them. 

So, the only applicable category is CoCoRes as first. Since the instruction requires three classes, perhaps Neutral and CoCoGM are forced into the remaining spots. Neutral would be a stretch because the citation is part of a comparison, not descriptive use. CoCoGM could be considered if the methods are being compared implicitly. Since the cited work used deuterium targets, maybe the citing paper's methods are different, leading to different results. In that case, the comparison includes both methods and results. The example under CoCoGM uses phrases like "proposals a method," hence comparing goals or methods. In our case, comparing methods used in experiments could fit CoCoGM. Therefore, CoCoRes is first, CoCoGM is second, and maybe Weakness is third if there's a critique, but without it. If there's no critique, Weakness is out. Therefore, perhaps the second could be CoCoGM if the methods are compared, but the sentence focuses on results differing from experiments with different methods. Therefore, the secondary might be CoCoRes and CoCoGM. 

Alternatively, considering that the citation is comparing their results with another study's results (CoCoRes), and perhaps their methods (CoCoGM), but since the sentence focuses on results, CoCoRes is first. Therefore, the top three would be CoCoRes, then maybe CoCoGM, then Neutral. 

So, based on the given definitions and example sentences, the correct classes are CoCoRes first, then possibly CoCoGM second, and maybe Neutral third, but without explicit comparison of methods, CoCoGM might not be warranted. Since the citation passage doesn't explicitly compare methods but talks about the results differing from those obtained with different methods, perhaps CoCoRes is the primary, and CoCoGM is secondary if the methods are part of the comparison's explanation. Alternatively, CoCoRes is primary and CoCoXY isn't applicable. Maybe Neutral is third as a fallback. 

Given the instructions require three, but after thorough analysis, CoCoRes is the first, CoCoGM is second if methods are implied, and Neutral third if there's any descriptive elements. Since the citation passage includes a comparison of results (CoCoRes) and mentions different methods (deuterium saturated targets), possibly CoCoGM and CoCoRes. 

In conclusion, CoCoRes is first, CoCoGM could be second, and Neutral third as the best fit given options.
