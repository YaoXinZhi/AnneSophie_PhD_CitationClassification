Okay, let's start by looking at the citation in question. The sentence is: "Similar results concerning the colonization rates of different phytoplasmal strains in various plant tissues have been previously reported by @@CITATION@." 

Step 1 is to extract the essential context around the citation. The keyword here is "similar results," which indicates that the authors are referring to prior research where they observed comparable colonization rates of phytoplasmal strains in different plants.

Step 2 involves determining the general intent. The use of "similar results" suggests that the current study's findings align with those previously reported by the cited work. This seems like a supportive statement, indicating that the cited study corroborates their results. 

Now, moving on to Step 3, ranking the rhetorical classes. The primary class here would likely be 'Similar' because the authors state "similar results," pointing out a similarity between their work and the cited study. That's the definition of the 'Similar' class. 

Next, considering secondary intents, could there be another class overlapping? Maybe 'Support' if they're using the citation to back up their own findings. However, since the sentence explicitly says "similar results," it's more about indicating similarity rather than just supporting their claim with external data without stating similarity. So 'Support' might come in second if we interpret the similarity as supporting. But maybe not as directly as 'Similar.' 

Another possible angle is 'CoCoRes' — comparing results — but since the authors aren't directly contrasting their results with others, just stating similarity, 'CoCoRes' might be a stretch. The citation isn't contrasting differences but affirming similarities. 

Thus, 'Similar' is the most accurate class. Looking at tertiary options, 'Support' might come second if it's considered providing support through similarity. Alternatively, 'Neutral' if the context is merely descriptive. But given the explicit use of "similar," which directly points to a similarity, 'Support' might be redundant here because similarity itself indicates support.

Wait, maybe 'Support' isn't necessary if the similarity is the reason for supporting. However, according to the definitions provided, 'Similar' is for similarity in findings, while 'Support' is when the citation is used to back the citing authors' claims. If they said something like "Our findings are supported by previous research (CITATION)," then it could be 'Support'. But their wording stresses similarity in results, so 'Similar' is more precise.

Therefore, the top classes are likely 'Similar', followed by maybe 'Support' if it functions as support by stating similarity. Alternatively, if the similarity is enough, maybe just 'Similar' is sufficient. Considering 'Support' is for confirming the work, result, or finding of the citing authors. Here, the cited authors are showing a similarity, which supports the citing authors' own findings. So perhaps 'Support' is also applicable. But in the example given for 'Similar', it's when they point out similarity between the cited work and the citing paper.

In conclusion, 'Similar' is primary. For secondary, maybe 'Support' if the similarity implies support. For tertiary, perhaps 'Neutral' if there's no strong intent beyond that. Alternatively, perhaps 'Basis' if the cited work is foundational. But the sentence isn't saying CITATION introduced a method, so 'Basis' is not applicable here.

Final ranking would be: 1. Similar, 2. Support, 3. Neutral.
