Okay, let's look at the citation marked @@CITATION@@ in the passage. The sentence reads: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." 

First, I need to extract the context. The key part here is comparing the results from the present work to those obtained in the cited study using different metal targets. The phrase "substantially differ" directly indicates a comparison between the results of the two studies.

The general intent here is a comparative one, specifically focusing on results. According to the definitions provided, this aligns with CoCoRes (Comparison of Results). 

Next, are there other possible rhetorical classes that might apply? Looking at the example given for CoCoRes, it's similar in structure where they mention results differing from cited experiments. There's no indication of comparing methods or goals, nor is there any similarity mentioned, so CoCoGM and Similar are out. The citation isn't being used to support the current study's findings or to point out weaknesses. Also, there's no motivational or future research direction suggested.

The next possible classes would be CoCoXY, which compares explanations or claims between studies. However, in this case, the comparison is directly between the current study's results and the cited study's, not between two cited studies as described in CoCoXY. 

Therefore, CoCoRes is the primary class here, followed by maybe Neutral if there's no strong second reason. But since the comparison is clear and specific to results, Neutral is less likely. The only other could be Basis if the citation is foundational, but the context is about differing results rather than foundational work. 

So the top three would be CoCoRes first. Then maybe CoCoXY as a secondary if there's ambiguity, but the example for CoCoXY involves contrasting two cited studies not with the current one. So perhaps Neutral would be third since the comparison might be straightforward, but given the clarity of difference in results, CoCoRes is the strongest. Maybe Weakness isn't applicable here unless the cited study's results are considered flawed, but the current text just states there's a difference, not a flaw. 

So the top rhetorical class is CoCoRes, then perhaps CoCoGM if there's a slight methodological difference implied, but the context focuses on results. So CoCoRes is first, Neutral could be third if needed, maybe Support isn't there. Alternatively, Weakness if the cited study's methods are considered flawed, but the sentence doesn't indicate that. 

Finalizing: CoCoRes is the main one. Second could be Basis if the cited work is the foundation, but again, the contrast is the key here. Therefore, CoCoRes is 1st, maybe CoCoXY is second if it's a comparison between two studies, but in this example it's between cited and citing paper's results. So CoCoRes is 1st. If there's a second and third, perhaps similar isn't applicable. Future? No. Weakness? No. Usage? No. So Neutral? Maybe as third if there's little other. But the instruction says top three. So the output would be CoCoRes first, perhaps CoCoGM as second if methods are compared, but text refers to results. Neutral might be third if there's descriptive, but the difference is explicit. However, given the example for Neutral mentions a descriptive use. The current context is descriptive of a difference rather than supporting or motivating. But Neutral would apply when there's no strong intent. However, CoCoRes is more precise here. If Neutral is third, it might be if the citation is stated neutrally without further context. Alternatively, maybe Weakness is possible but the text doesn't criticize the cited study. 

Overall, CoCoRes is clear first. Then Neutral as second. Third could be Basis if the cited study is foundational, but the comparison is the key. Alternatively, CoCoXY if comparing explanations, but the example for CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies, not cited and current. Therefore, I'll stick with CoCoRes as first, Neutral as second, and maybe Basis as third if there's foundational element, but not sure. Given the lack of other clear options, Neutral would be second perhaps. Wait, looking at the example of Neutral: "In the USA the use..." which is descriptive and lacks support or comparison. The current example states a difference in results, which is a direct comparison, hence CoCoRes. So Neutral isn't applicable here as it's not descriptive but comparative. Maybe Weakness isn't it. 

Thus, the top three are CoCoRes, then possibly CoCoGM or CoCoXY if forced, but given that the example for CoCoRes fits best here, maybe CoCoRes is first, then Neutral, then Basis. But Neutral isn't the case here. Hmm. Maybe I've overcomplicated. The clear fit is CoCoRes, then perhaps Neutral as second if there's a neutral statement of results, but given the explicit comparison, Neutral isn't. Wait, looking at the Neutral example again, it's a statement without comparison: "In the USA the use... @@CITATION@." So the current passage isn't Neutral. Therefore, CoCoRes is the only clear fit. However the task requires three classes ranked. Maybe Neutral isn't applicable. Alternatively, maybe CoCoRes is first, then perhaps Basis as second if the cited study is foundational, but the example doesn't indicate that. Let me re-read the context. The cited study's results are compared to the current results as differing. The Basis class example is foundational, like introducing a method. If the cited work isn't foundational but just providing results to compare, then Basis isn't second. Maybe CoCoRes is first, then CoCoXY as third if comparing explanations, but there's no other study involved. 

Therefore, given the instructions require three classes, perhaps CoCoRes is first, then Neutral as second, then maybe Support as third, but the text doesn't support the current findings. This might be tricky. Since the user insists on three, perhaps the correct ranking is 1. CoCoRes, 2. Neutral, 3. Basis. But Neutral isn't accurate here. Maybe Weakness is second if the difference implies cited study's results are flawed. The text says "substantially differ," which could imply criticism. Weakness example says citing results as problematic. So perhaps Weakness is second. 

But the example given for CoCoRes involves a substantial difference, so Weakness might not apply unless the cited results are considered unreliable. The passage doesn't state that. The user's example for Weakness mentions problematic taxonomic status. Here, the current work's results differ from cited ones but doesn't critique the cited study. 

Therefore, CoCoRes is the correct first class. The second could be Basis if the cited study is foundational. Wait, the Basis example introduces a method. The cited study here provided results that are compared. Maybe not Basis. 

After all that, perhaps CoCoRes is first, then maybe Neutral as second, and then Basis as third. Even though Neutral isn't clearly applicable, the instructions require three. But I'm uncertain. Alternatively, maybe CoCoRes is first, then CoCoXY as third if there's any comparison of claims, but there isn't here. 

Given the instructions require three, I'll proceed with CoCoRes first, and the next two might be Weakness or Neutral, but Neutral seems less likely. Perhaps Neutral is the next if there's little else. Wait, but in the given example of Neutral, there's a descriptive citation without any comparison or support. If the comparison in this case is explicit, Neutral wouldn't be the right choice. So perhaps CoCoRes is first, then maybe Neutral is not appropriate, so maybe Weakness if I force it, but the text doesn't indicate that. 

I'm overcomplicating. The primary answer is CoCoRes. If forced to choose three, perhaps the top three are CoCoRes, Neutral, and Basis, even if some are weakly fitting.
