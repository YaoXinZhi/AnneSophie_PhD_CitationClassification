Okay, I need to analyze the given scientific passage and the citation marked as @@CITATION@@ to determine the top three rhetorical classes. Let's start by extracting the context around the citation.

Looking at the sentence: "Our results also indicated that the presence of a specific gene variant significantly increases resistance to the disease, corroborating previous findings by @@CITATION@@." 

The key part here is "corroborating previous findings by @@CITATION@@", which suggests that the citation is being used to support the authors' current results by referencing existing research. 

The general intent here seems to be supportive. The authors are reinforcing their findings with existing literature. According to the step-by-step guide, Supportive intent corresponds to the classes Support or Similar. Support is when the citation is used to confirm the work or results of the citing authors. The example given for Support is similar to this case, where previous research supports the current results. 

Next, checking if there are other intents. The sentence doesn't indicate a comparison with the cited work's results (CoCoRes), methods or goals (CoCoGM), or explanations (CoCoXY). There's no mention of future research or motivation based on knowledge gaps. There's also no criticism, so Weakness is unlikely. The citation isn't introducing a foundation either. 

So the most appropriate class here is Support. Then, considering Similar, but Similar is for pointing out similarity between the cited work and the citing paper. Since "corroborating" implies support rather than just noting similarity, Support takes precedence. Neutral is not applicable here as it's an active use of the citation to back their results. 

Thus, the top three classes would be Support first. There doesn't seem to be a second class that fits better than Neutral or Similar, but CoCoRes isn't present. Wait, maybe the cited study's results are being compared, so CoCoRes could be a candidate. However, in the example provided for CoCoRes, the citation is used to directly compare results. Here, "corroborating" suggests agreement without a direct contrast, so maybe it's Support rather than CoCoRes. Therefore, Support is first, and perhaps Similar comes in second because corroboration can indicate similarity in findings. Neutral could be third if there's no other fit.
