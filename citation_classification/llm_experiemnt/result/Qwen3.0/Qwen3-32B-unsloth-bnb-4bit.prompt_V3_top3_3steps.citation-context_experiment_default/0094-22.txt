Okay, let me tackle this classification. First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The sentence says, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." 

Looking at this, the key part is "substantially differ from the results of...". The author is comparing their results with another study's findings. According to the definitions, CoCoRes is for comparing results directly. 

Next, the general intent here is Comparative, so it fits into the CoCoRes category. Are there other possible classes? Maybe Neutral if it were just stating facts without comparison, but the wording is clearly contrasting results, so Neutral is less likely. 

Now, checking for secondary classes. Could there be a mention that's also a Basis? Not really; this isn't about foundational work. CoCoGM or CoCoXY? No, because it's about results, not goals, methods, or other explanations. 

So the top three are CoCoRes as the primary. The example given for CoCoRes matches this scenario exactly. There's no mention of future work or support here. Neutral might be a stretch here since the comparison is explicit. Therefore, CoCoRes is first, then maybe Neutral as a distant third if forced, but I need to check if there are three distinct classes. Wait, the output requires exactly three. Let me make sure I don't miss others.

Since the sentence is directly comparing results, CoCoRes is the main. Are there two other classes that could be relevant? Not unless there's more nuanced context. The example given for CoCoRes is almost identical, so I should stick with CoCoRes as number one. I'll rank CoCoRes first, then perhaps Neutral as second if it's just descriptive, but the sentence is specifically contrasting, not neutral description. Wait, Neutral is when the citation is used descriptively without supporting or comparing. But here, it's comparing results. So maybe Neutral isn't even applicable. The second could be CoCoXY if comparing explanations, but the example for CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies, not the current paper's results with another's. So no. 

Therefore, the top is CoCoRes, followed maybe by something else... but maybe only CoCoRes is correct, but the task requires three. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me re-read the example. The CoCoRes example is about comparing present results with cited results. That's exactly this case. So CoCoRes is definitely first. Are there others? Maybe CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two cited works, but the example for CoCoXY involves conflicting results between two cited studies. Here, the paper's results are compared to the cited study. So CoCoRes is correct. Then maybe Neutral isn't applicable. Wait, the instruction says to output exactly three. So perhaps the top three are CoCoRes, Neutral, then maybe... no. Wait, the user might expect three, even if others are not applicable. Maybe after CoCoRes, then Neutral and Basis? But why? The Basis is when the citation is foundational. Since this is about differing results, perhaps Neutral isn't relevant. Maybe the second could be Neutral if there's a descriptive use alongside the comparison. Wait, the example for Neutral is about stating a fact descriptively. Here, the sentence states a difference in results, which is a contrast, not a neutral statement. So perhaps CoCoRes is the only correct class here, but the task requires three. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the definitions again.

Looking back, CoCoRes is a type of Comparative intent, directly comparing results. Basis is foundational. Support is when the citation supports the current findings. Motivation is about justifying the current research. Future is directions for future work. Weakness is criticism. Neutral is descriptive. The given sentence is comparing results with another study's, which is CoCoRes. So the top class is CoCoRes. For the next two, maybe Neutral if the comparison is stated descriptively without critique, but the sentence says "substantially differ", which implies a contrast. So perhaps there's no second class applicable. Wait, maybe CoCoXY? CoCoXY is comparing explanations or claims between two cited works. In this case, the current work is compared to the cited work, so CoCoXY isn't relevant. CoCoGM is comparing goals or methods, which isn't happening here. Therefore, maybe there are only two classes applicable: CoCoRes and perhaps Neutral if it's just stating results. Wait, but Neutral would require that the citation is neutral, not comparing or supporting. Since the sentence is comparing results, it's not Neutral. So perhaps only CoCoRes is correct, but the task requires three. Maybe I need to include Neutral as the third. Hmm, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. The user might accept CoCoRes as first, and Neutral and other as second and third even if they're not perfect fits. Alternatively, maybe there are two other classes that fit better. Wait, the user wants the top three from the predefined list. Let's look at the example given in the task:

The example under CoCoRes is nearly identical to the provided sentence. So the answer should be CoCoRes first. Then Neutral could be third if there's no better fit. Maybe Support isn't applicable, but Neutral perhaps if it's just describing the cited work's existence. So maybe CoCoRes, then Neutral third. But maybe the user expects exactly three, even if others are not strongly applicable. So ranking CoCoRes first, then Neutral as second, then Basis as third? But why Basis? The Basis is foundational. Unless the cited work is foundational, but the current paper is contrasting results. So Basis is not applicable. Therefore, the only correct rhetorical class here is CoCoRes. But the task requires three. Wait, maybe I need to think again. Perhaps after CoCoRes, maybe Motivation or Future isn't applicable. The third could be Neutral if it's just descriptive. Maybe the user expects three entries. Let me go with CoCoRes as 1, Neutral as 2, CoCoXY as 3. Wait, but CoCoXY compares two cited studies. Since there's only one cited study here, CoCoXY isn't possible. Neutral might be third if the citation is mentioned in a descriptive way, perhaps. So the answer could be:

1. CoCoRes
2. Neutral
3. Support

No, because Support is when the citation supports the current work. Here, there's a difference, not support. Maybe Neutral is second, then Future as third. But Future is about directions for future research. So perhaps Neutral is second, then Basis. Hmm, this is confusing. Since the task requires exactly three, perhaps the answer is CoCoRes first, then Neutral as second, then maybe No class? Wait, the user wants three. In the example given, the output was CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Neutral. So maybe in this case, after CoCoRes, Neutral is third. Wait, perhaps Neutral isn't applicable. Therefore, maybe the correct answer is CoCoRes, then two other classes that aren't really fitting, but I have to list three. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the task. Maybe the citation is directly comparing results (CoCoRes), and the sentence is doing that directly, so CoCoRes is the only correct one, but need to pick three regardless. Wait, the user says "top three most appropriate", so maybe there's only one applicable. However, the example given by the user has more than one. Maybe perhaps Neutral is third because the citation is mentioned in a neutral manner. Wait, Neutral is when it's used descriptively without supporting, comparing, etc. Here, the comparison is explicit, so Neutral isn't the case. Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe there are only two. Wait, the instruction says to output exactly three. Maybe I need to include CoCoRes as first, then maybe another. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to look for similarities with the example. In the example given, CoCoRes was first, CoCoXY second, Neutral third. But in the provided sentence, it's only CoCoRes. Therefore, maybe the correct answer is CoCoRes, then maybe CoCoXY isn't present, Neutral as second, and perhaps another class. Wait, perhaps Weakness if the cited work has limitations. But the sentence states that results differ, not that the cited work is flawed. Therefore, Weakness isn't applicable. 

I think I've overcomplicated this. The correct answer is CoCoRes as the primary class. Since the task requires three, maybe Neutral and CoCoXY are next, even if they're not directly applicable. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is only CoCoRes, Neutral, and another. I think the user expects CoCoRes to be the primary and maybe Neutral as the third if there's a mention that's descriptive. Given that the citation is used to indicate a contrasting result, but also mentions the existence of previous work, perhaps Neutral is second? Not sure. Given all that, I'll proceed with CoCoRes as first, then Neutral and then Basis, even though Basis is not fitting. Alternatively, maybe Neutral isn't correct. Given the time spent, I think the correct output is CoCoRes first. I'll follow the example closely where a direct comparison of results is done, so CoCoRes as 1, Neutral as 2 (since Neutral might involve stating the existence of the cited work's experiments), and perhaps Usage as third. Wait, Usage refers to using a method from the cited work, which isn't the case here. Therefore, perhaps Neutral is incorrect here. Given the confusion, I'll proceed with CoCoRes, CoCoXY, and Neutral as placeholders, realizing that CoCoXY might not fit, but the task requires three entries.
