Okay, let's start by looking at the context around the citation marked @@CITATION@@. The sentence is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@."

So the main point here is comparing the results of the current study with those from previous experiments that used deuterium-saturated metal targets as described in the cited work. The key words are "substantially differ from the results," which indicates a direct comparison of findings. According to the definitions given, when results are compared directly between the citing paper and the cited work, that falls under CoCoRes (Comparison of Results).

Next, checking if there's a secondary classification. The example provided for CoCoRes matches this scenario exactly. There's also mention of different experimental setups (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD), which is part of the experimental method or materials used. However, the primary intent here is comparing results, not the methods or goals, so CoCoGM wouldn't be as fitting. There's no mention of contrasting the cited work's results with other studies or the citing paper's goals explicitly here, so CoCoXY isn't applicable either.

Looking further, there's no indication that the citation is being used to support the authors' own findings, as in Support, nor is it pointing out similarities without direct comparison. The citation isn't being used to describe a general context neutral to the paper's arguments either. There's also no motivation or future work suggested here; the sentence is straightforwardly contrasting results. Therefore, the primary classification is CoCoRes. The next possible classes might be CoCoGM if there was a method comparison, but since the focus is on results, CoCoRes takes precedence. Neutral would only apply if it's purely descriptive, which isn't the case here. As for the third place, I'd consider Neutral because it's part of the experimental context, but since the comparison is the main activity, Neutral might rank a bit lower. There's also no mention of weaknesses or critiques of the cited work. Hence, the top three classifications are CoCoRes as main, then perhaps Neutral due to mentioning materials (TiD, TaD, etc.), which could be seen as descriptive. However, since the sentence specifically contrasts results, Neutral might not be the second choice. Another angle could be Support if the cited results are used to confirm discrepancies, but again, the direct comparison is the key factor. Therefore, finalizing CoCoRes as first, then if I have to pick two more, perhaps CoCoGM could come second if there's a method comparison implied by mentioning different targets. However, the sentence states that the experiments were conducted with specific materials (deuterium saturated metal targets), which could imply comparing methods (the materials used), suggesting CoCoGM. But since the cited work's materials differ from the current ones, maybe CoCoGM is applicable here. Alternatively, it's more about how different experimental setups lead to different results, thus CoCoRes is the primary and CoCoGM is secondary. Wait, but the cited work's methods are contrasting with the current methods? Or are they using different materials? The sentence says the current work's results differ from the experiments using specific targets. The experiments with deuterium targets are the cited ones. So if the cited work used different methods (materials here), that's a CoCoGM. However, if the comparison is between the results (outcomes), it's CoCoRes. Given that the sentence explicitly mentions the results differing, CoCoRes is the top classification. Secondary could be CoCoGM since the experimental setup (materials used) is part of the method comparison. But the user's instruction says that Comparative includes CoCoGM (Goals or Methods). Therefore, CoCoRes would be the primary, CoCoGM secondary because the methods involve different materials. Wait, but the cited work's method involved specific targets. The current paper's method isn't specified here. However, the sentence says the results differ because of the materials used in the cited experiments. So maybe CoCoRes is the comparison of outcomes (results), while CoCoGM is the comparison of methods (materials used). Therefore, the top would be CoCoRes and CoCoGM. But according to the example given for CoCoRes, it's a direct comparison of results, which matches here. Meanwhile, Neutral could also be third since it's part of the experimental context but not a direct comparison of results or goals. However, Neutral is only third if there's no better fit. Given the options, the top three are CoCoRes, CoCoGM, Neutral. Wait, Neutral is when the citation is described neutrally without supporting or comparing. But in this sentence, the citation is directly compared, so Neutral isn't quite right. Hmm, maybe Weakness? No, since there's no criticism here. The cited work's results are just different. Therefore, Weakness isn't appropriate. The remaining options are Basis, Future, Support, Similar, Usage. None of those apply here. So, based on this analysis, the primary is CoCoRes, followed by CoCoGM if the materials/methods are compared, and Neutral third if there's any descriptive element. However, if the comparison is strictly about results, CoCoRes is first, and CoCoGM is not applicable. Wait, the definition of CoCoGM involves comparing goals or methods between cited work and citing paper. If the cited work's method involved different materials (TiD, TaD), while the current work's method didn't (since it's contrasting their results), then CoCoGM is applicable because methods differ. Therefore, CoCoRes is first (comparison of results), CoCoGM second (comparison of methods), and perhaps Neutral third if there's any descriptive part. However, the sentence is more about results than methods. Alternatively, maybe Neutral is not present here. Let me re-read the sentence. The sentence says the present results differ from those experiments using deuterium-saturated targets (cited work). The comparison is between the cited work's results and the current results. Methods (materials) are mentioned but not directly compared in terms of goals or methods between the two studies. CoCoGM is for comparing goals or methods. Since the cited work's method involved specific materials, and the current study's method probably did not (since their results differ), that would be CoCoGM. So CoCoGM is secondary. But the main comparison is of results, hence CoCoRes first. If CoCoGM is secondary due to method comparison, then third could be Neutral, but maybe there's no third applicable. Wait, Neutral is when the citation is used neutrally to describe context without direct comparison. Since the citation here is actively being compared for results and methods, Neutral wouldn't fit. Therefore, the top three are CoCoRes, CoCoGM, and maybe nothing else. Hmm. The example given for CoCoRes is a direct comparison between cited work's results and current work's, which matches the sentence. The mention of materials in the cited work's experiments could imply CoCoGM, since methods are different (using TiD etc.) versus methods in current work. So the primary is CoCoRes, secondary CoCoGM. But is that valid? If the goal of the cited work was to use those materials and the current work has a different goal, that's CoCoGM. However, in the example here, the methods' materials are different, but maybe the goals are the same. Therefore, maybe the comparison is purely of results (CoCoRes) and methods aren't being compared in terms of goals, just materials. Therefore, CoCoRes is the primary, perhaps CoCoGM isn't directly applicable because it's about goals or methods, not materials. Wait, materials are part of the method. So if the cited work used different materials (methods), and that's affecting the results, then CoCoGM is about comparing methods, so CoCoGM and CoCoRes both apply. But according to the predefined classes, Comparative includes CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY. So if both methods and results are compared, then CoCoRes is likely more relevant as it's about results. The mention of materials is part of the method, but the comparison is on results. Therefore, the top is CoCoRes, followed by CoCoGM if methods are discussed, and maybe Neutral third if there's unrelated description. But since the sentence is directly contrasting results, Neutral isn't a fit. The only other possible class is Usage or Basis. No, the cited work isn't being used as a tool in the current study. The cited work is providing results to contrast with the current results. Therefore, CoCoRes is the primary. The secondary could be CoCoGM if there's a comparison of methods. Since the cited work used specific targets and current work didn't, and that's affecting the results, maybe CoCoGM is secondary. But in the absence of explicit mention of methods contrasting goals, perhaps CoCoGM isn't the best fit. The user example for CoCoGM is comparing goals or methods. Here, the cited work's methods are being compared (different materials), which falls under CoCoGM. Therefore, CoCoRes is first, CoCoGM is second, and Neutral is third since the materials are mentioned but there's no neutral description. But Neutral is described as citation used neutrally without supporting or comparing anything specific. Since Neutral is not applicable here as the citation is being used to compare results, the third could be Basis. Wait, Basis is foundational references. No, since the citation is being contrasted, not foundational. The cited work's results are different, so Basis isn't applicable. Therefore, after CoCoRes and CoCoGM, perhaps Weakness? No, since no criticism is implied. Neutral is left as third. Maybe Neutral is third because the materials are part of the experimental setup, but Neutral is about descriptive use. Alternatively, perhaps there's no third applicable class beyond CoCoRes and maybe CoCoGM, but according to instructions, three classes must be selected. Given that CoCoRes is primary, CoCoGM is secondary due to method comparison, and Neutral is third if it's part of the experimental context. Since Neutral is used when the citation is described neutrally without direct comparison, maybe Neutral is included as third if there's any descriptive part. Alternatively, the sentence is purely comparative, so Neutral isn't applicable. Therefore, the top three are CoCoRes, CoCoGM, and another class. Maybe the materials mentioned are part of the experimental setup, but that would relate to Usage if they were used. No, Usage is when the cited method is used directly. Here, they are contrasting materials used. Maybe CoCoXY isn't applicable since it's comparing cited works with each other, not with the citing paper. So after CoCoRes and CoCoGM, the third could be Weakness or Neutral. Since there's no indication of weakness, Neutral is the only remaining option. Therefore, the final top three are CoCoRes (1), CoCoGM (2), Neutral (3).
