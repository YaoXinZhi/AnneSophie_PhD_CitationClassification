Okay, let's start by identifying the part of the citation passage that includes the @@CITATION@@ marker. The relevant sentence is: "Most closely related to this paper is concurrent work by @@CITATION@@ who propose a method to ‘debias’ word embeddings. Our work is complementary, as we focus instead on rigorously demonstrating human-like biases in word embeddings." 

Now I'll analyze the context and determine the intent of citing this reference. The paper is saying "Most closely related to this paper is concurrent work by..." suggesting they are comparing their work with previous work. The citation is being used to compare or contrast goals or methods with the cited paper's methodology about debiasing embeddings with their own work on demonstrating biases.

The general intent seems Comparative, comparing research goals or methods. Looking at specific classes defined:

- CoCoGM fits directly since the citation is comparing research goals or methods between papers.
- Support could be possible if they were using the cited work as backing, but it's more comparing methodologies rather than supporting evidence.
- Basis might be relevant if establishing intellectual foundation, but the context is more about concurrent work rather than foundational concepts.
- Motivation could be there as justification, but again the focus seems on contrasting approaches.
- Future could relate to directions mentioned, but it's about current approaches rather than future work.

So top choices would be CoCoGM as primary class, possibly Support and CoCoRes as secondary options based on context, though CoCoGM fits best given direct comparison of objectives and methods stated in the comparison.
