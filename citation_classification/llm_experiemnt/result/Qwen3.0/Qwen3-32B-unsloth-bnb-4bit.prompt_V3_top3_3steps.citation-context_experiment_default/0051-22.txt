Okay, let's start by looking at the task. I need to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation marked in the passage. The user provided a context excerpt where the citation is mentioned.

First step: Extract the relevant context. The sentence is: “The occurrence of phytoplasmas infecting plants in this area was previously confirmed and described in our previous study @@CITATION@@.” The key part here is that they’re referencing their prior study to establish that phytoplasmas were already found there.

Next, determine the general intent. Since they're citing their own previous work to confirm that the occurrence was already known, this seems like it's laying the foundation for their current research. That points towards the 'Basis' class because they're using their past work as a foundational reference.

Looking at the options, 'Basis' fits here. There's no comparison between their work and others, nor are they supporting another study's results. They’re just stating prior confirmation. The other classes like 'Support' might be if they were backing up their current findings with the previous study, but here it's more about establishing prior knowledge as groundwork.

So the primary class is Basis. For the second and third ranks, maybe 'Similar' could be considered if they were pointing out similarities, but the sentence doesn't mention similarities with other studies. 'Neutral' might apply if it's just a factual citation, but since it's about their own prior work establishing foundation, Basis is stronger. 'CoCoRes' or others don't seem to fit here. So the top three would be Basis first, then possibly Neutral if there's any, but maybe only Basis is prominent here.

1. Basis  
2. Support  
3. Neutral
