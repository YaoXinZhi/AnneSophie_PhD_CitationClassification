Okay, let's tackle this classification task step by step. First, I need to find the context around the given @@CITATION@@ in the passage. The example mentions conflicting results in a specific study, so I should look there.

Step 1: Extracting Context. The sentence says there's conflicting results described in @@CITATION@@, comparing two studies. The example provided earlier involves comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies, not contrasting with the citing paper.

Step 2: Determine General Intent. The citation is used to highlight conflicting findings between two studies, which falls under the Comparative category. Specifically, since it's comparing explanations or claims between cited studies, it's likely CoCoXY.

Step 3: Assigning Classes. The primary class here is CoCoXY. Next, considering other possibilities, maybe Neutral if it's just stating a fact without supporting or comparing, but since it's a direct contrast between two cited studies, CoCoXY is first. Neutral might come second if the citation isn't supporting any argument here. Then perhaps Support if there's any implication of backing a point, but the example doesn't seem to support the current paper's argument but rather explains conflicting results between others. So Neutral could be third.
