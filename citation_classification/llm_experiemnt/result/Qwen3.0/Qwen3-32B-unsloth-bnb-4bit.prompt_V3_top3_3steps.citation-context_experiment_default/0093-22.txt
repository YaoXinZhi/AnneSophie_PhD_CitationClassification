Okay, I need to analyze the provided citation context to determine the top three rhetorical classes. Let's start by carefully reading the excerpt where the citation appears.

The user has given me a scientific passage with a citation (marked with @@CITATION@@). Let me extract that context first.

The relevant sentence around the citation reads:
"Our findings regarding the impact of phytoplasma concentration on leaf development in daisies align with those reported by @@CITATION@@."

Now that I've identified the exact sentence containing the citation, I'll move to Step 2, where I need to determine the general intent.

This citation appears to be referencing another study to show alignment with the findings of the current research. It's saying "our findings align with those by @@CITATION@@", so the general intent seems Supportive - they're pointing out similarity between their findings and those of the cited work.

For Step 3, I need to rank the finest-grained rhetorical classes:
1. The most specific class seems to be Similar - they're saying their findings are similar to those cited.
2. Second might be Support, as the citation helps support their finding of alignment.
3. And most broadly would be Foundational (Basis), since it's building on previous research (though not explicitly stated).

Let me double-check the definitions:
- Similar: Points out similarity between cited work and citing paper
- Support: Used to support work, result, or finding
- Basis: References intellectual foundation of current research

Given the sentence is stating alignment (similarity), the most specific class would indeed be Similar.

1. Similar  
2. Support  
3. Basis
