Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the citation @@CITATION@@. The passage mentions that the methods and results of the present work differ substantially from those experiments conducted with deuterium saturated metal targets, citing @@CITATION@@. 

Next, identifying the general intent. Since the authors are comparing their own results with the cited work's results, that points towards a comparative intent. According to the definitions, this would fall under Comparative, which includes CoCoRes.

Now, ranking the specific classes. The primary purpose here is to compare results directly, so CoCoRes is the top choice. There's also a mention of contrasting the results, which might involve CoCoXY if it's comparing the cited studies with each other, but the example given in CoCoRes matches this scenario better. Neutral might be a stretch here because they are actively contrasting, not just mentioning neutrally. So the top three are CoCoRes, then maybe CoCoXY if there's a secondary comparison between studies, and Neutral as a fallback, but in this case, the direct comparison suggests CoCoRes is first, and perhaps Support or Similar isn't fitting. Wait, Support would be if they're confirming their findings with the cited work, but here they are contrasting. Weakness might be if they're criticizing the cited work, but the example in CoCoRes doesn't indicate criticism, just contrast. So CoCoRes is first. The example in CoCoXY involves comparing two cited studies with each other, not with their own. Since the passage compares their own results with the cited work's, CoCoRes is correct. So the top class is CoCoRes. The next could be CoCoXY if there's a comparison between cited studies, but the example here doesn't have another citation mentioned. Wait, the current context only mentions one citation, so CoCoXY is for comparing two cited studies, but here it's comparing their own results with cited. So CoCoRes is first. The second might be Support if they support their contrast with the cited work. Wait, but Support is for confirming the citing authors. Hmm. Maybe Neutral if it's just stating a fact. Alternatively, since they directly contrast their results against the cited work, CoCoRes is the first, and perhaps Basis? No, Basis is foundational. So Neutral might come third if the rest isn't fitting. Wait, the primary intent is Comparative via results, so CoCoRes is first. Then maybe Future? No, Future is about suggesting future work. Neutral if they're just stating a fact without argument. Hmm. Maybe CoCoRes (first), then CoCoXY if comparing two cited works, but there's only one citation mentioned. So Neutral isn't the case here. Wait, the example given for CoCoRes is a direct comparison with their own results. Therefore, CoCoRes is the top. Since there's only one citation involved here, CoCoXY isn't applicable. Then Neutral might come third if the rest don't fit. Or maybe the ranking is CoCoRes first, then perhaps Support or Weakness. But Support would be confirming their work, which isn't the case here. Weakness would be if they're pointing out flaws in the cited work, which they aren't. So the top is CoCoRes. The next might be CoCoXY if there's an implied comparison between citing two works, but in this case, only one citation is mentioned, so it's probably Neutral. Wait, Neutral is when the citation is neutral and descriptive. But here, the authors are directly contrasting their results with the cited work's results. Therefore, the top three should be CoCoRes (first), then maybe similar (if they mention similarity, but they don't), so Neutral might be third if they aren't doing any other rhetorical purpose. Alternatively, maybe future? Hmm. The example given for Future suggests directions, but in this case, they are contrasting results. So the top three are CoCoRes (1), then Neutral (if applicable). Wait, maybe Neutral isn't the best third. Let me recheck the original passage: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@" So the main intent is to compare their results against the cited work's results. Therefore, CoCoRes is definitely first. The other classes aren't fitting here, so maybe Neutral is third, but in the absence of better classes, Neutral might be third if there's no stronger candidates. But CoCoXY requires comparison between two cited studies. Since only one is cited, perhaps Neutral. Hmm. Wait, Neutral is when the citation is neutral and descriptive. In this case, the authors are directly contrasting their work with cited work's results, so CoCoRes is first. Then perhaps CoCoXY isn't applicable here. Neutral might still be third if nothing else applies. But perhaps Neutral isn't the best third. Maybe there's nothing else applicable, so Neutral is third. Alternatively, if there's no better options, Neutral could be third. So the top three would be CoCoRes, then perhaps Weakness or Similar isn't fitting. Wait, Weakness is criticism, which isn't happening here. Similar would require similarity. Therefore, CoCoRes is first, and Neutral third. But the example given in Neutral is more about stating a fact neutrally. However, here the authors are directly contrasting results, so CoCoRes is first. Then maybe Similar isn't applicable, perhaps Neutral comes third because there's no further classes. So final ranking is CoCoRes, then maybe CoCoXY isn't applicable, Neutral isn't fitting, perhaps the third is Neutral.
