Okay, let's start by looking at the citation in the given passage. The context around @@CITATION@@ is about how it describes the results of experiments done with deuterium saturated metal targets. The authors of the current paper state that their results "substantially differ" from those cited.

So the main intent here is comparing their own results with the cited one. That fits the CoCoRes category because it's a direct comparison of findings. 

Now, looking at the examples provided, CoCoRes examples involve contrasting results between the current work and the cited paper. 

There's also mention of "results obtained in the present work" versus the experiments in the cited work, which confirms it's a result comparison. 

The citation isn't used to motivate the research or as support, because the authors aren't saying they're following up on previous findings but rather noting differences. 

Is there any other comparison happening? Like the methods or goals? The example provided says "comparison of results", and here it's stated "substantially differ", which is a clear contrast in results. 

So CoCoRes is the primary class. Are there secondary ones? Maybe Neutral if there's descriptive use, but the comparison is the key here. Since the example in CoCoRes matches the structure of contrasting results, that's the leading class. 

The next classes could be something else, but looking again, the citation is only contrasting results, so CoCoRes is first. Are there other types of comparisons? Maybe CoCoGM if discussing methods or goals, but the passage says "results... differ" which points more to CoCoRes. 

Therefore, CoCoRes is definitely rank 1. Since there's no other explicit comparison between the current work and the cited one beyond results, maybe the next classes are Neutral if the context otherwise is descriptive. But the main action here is contrasting results, so CoCoRes is the top. 

For the second place, maybe CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two cited works, but the example here is between their work and the cited one. So CoCoRes is the only relevant here. The example in CoCoXY has conflicting results between two cited studies. In this case, it's the current paper vs the cited one, so CoCoRes applies. 

Hence, CoCoRes is first. There's no other class fitting better. Neutral might be third if any, but since the focus is on comparison, Neutral isn't applicable here. 

Therefore, the top three classes are CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral if descriptive, and perhaps nothing else. But since the instruction requires three, maybe Neutral is third even if weak. But looking back, the example given for CoCoRes is similar, so CoCoRes is definitely first. Neutral would only apply if the citation is just stated factually without comparison. But here it's contrasting results, so CoCoRes is the most accurate. 

Finalizing the ranking: CoCoRes as first. Second and third could be other if there's a hint, but I think CoCoRes is the primary here, and the others may not apply unless implied. But perhaps Neutral is third if the citation is just presenting information without further context. The example given for Neutral is about spreading magnetic devices without a direct comparison. So Neutral might not fit unless there's a descriptive role here. The current citation is contrasting results, so Neutral is not the case. Therefore, the only applicable class is CoCoRes as first, and maybe other comparative ones if present, but since it's about results, CoCoRes is top. The example for CoCoRes exactly matches the structure here. So my top three are CoCoRes, then Neutral might not fit, perhaps Basis but no. Wait, in the context description, the citation references experiments, and the current work's results differ. There isn't a foundation here mentioned. Therefore, CoCoRes is definitely first. The second and third might be Neutral if there's no other classes. But I need three. Since there's only a clear CoCoRes fit, maybe Neutral is third if there's any descriptive element, even if minimal. Alternatively, maybe CoCoGM if goals or methods are mentioned. But the context says the results differ, not methods. Hence, CoCoRes is first, then maybe no other classes fit. Since the instruction requires three, perhaps Neutral as second and Basis as third, but that's a stretch. Wait, the example given for Basis is about introducing a foundational work. Since this citation is comparing results rather than being foundational, Basis isn't fitting. 

Thus, the top three rhetorical classes here are CoCoRes (1), then maybe Neutral (2), and perhaps Weakness if the cited work's results are criticized. But the passage says "substantially differ", which could imply critique, so Weakness might be applicable. But in the Weakness example, the citation is criticized as problematic. Here, it's the current work's results differing from cited ones, but it's not stated that the cited work is flawed, just different. So Weakness might not apply unless the authors are implying the cited results are wrong, but the example here states "substantially differ", which doesn't necessarily mean the cited work is wrong, just different. 

So CoCoRes is first. There's no other clear second class in this scenario. Maybe Neutral if the citation is mentioned descriptively elsewhere, but in this case, the comparison is direct. Therefore, the top three would be CoCoRes as 1, then neutral as 2 if any descriptive mention, but perhaps Neutral isn't applicable. Wait, the citation is used directly in the comparison, so Neutral isn't relevant here. 

But the output requires three entries. Since the primary is CoCoRes, maybe two others are less relevant but present. Alternatively, the system requires forcing three. Looking back, perhaps CoCoRes is the primary, and then maybe Neutral or CoCoGM as secondary. But without evidence for those, the safest ranking is CoCoRes first, then Neutral or Weakness as second and third. Alternatively, if there's no other classes fitting, the instruction might require including Neutral as third. But I need three entries, so perhaps CoCoRes, then maybe Basis as a stretch if the cited work is foundational for comparison purposes. But Basis typically refers to intellectual foundations, not direct comparisons. 

Given the strict instructions, perhaps the top three are CoCoRes, Neutral, and maybe Future, but there's no indication of future directions here. 

After thorough consideration, the only fitting class is CoCoRes. Since the user requires three, maybe CoCoRes as 1, Neutral as 2 and Weakness as 3 if the cited work is implied to be problematic because theirs differ, which might suggest the cited work is incorrect. But the example for Weakness says the cited results are problematic, whereas this case just states differing results without criticism. So Weakness might still not apply. 

Thus, the top three rhetorical classes are:

1. CoCoRes
2. Neutral
3. Basis

But Basis doesn't fit here. Hmm. Maybe instead of Basis, it's CoCoGM or another. Alternatively, perhaps only CoCoRes is correct, but the system forces three entries. Given that, maybe CoCoRes (1), CoCoXY (2), Neutral (3). CoCoXY is comparison between two cited works. But in this case, it's between the current work and cited work. Therefore, CoCoRes is the correct first. The rest might be Neutral or others even if not perfectly fitting. The examples suggest CoCoRes is the most accurate here.
