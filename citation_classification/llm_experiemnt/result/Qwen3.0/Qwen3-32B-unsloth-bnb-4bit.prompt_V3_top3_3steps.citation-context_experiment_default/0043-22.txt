Okay, let's tackle this. First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The original passage mentions a study comparing results with the experiments from 2017 by the same authors. They talk about the absence of systemic symptoms when the grafting partner was resistant and reduced symptoms when the host was susceptible. The words "however," suggest a contrast. The cited work (2017) is being compared with their own findings. 

Next, identifying the general intent. Since they are directly contrasting their results with the cited study, this seems like a Comparative intent focusing on results. Comparing findings would fall under CoCoRes. 

Now, looking at specific classes. The primary class here is CoCoRes because they are comparing results directly. There's a mention of a conflicting result in the cited study regarding graft compatibility, so maybe a secondary CoCoRes for that conflicting point. Also, since they are highlighting differences, Weakness might be involved if they're pointing out flaws in the previous work's methods or claims. But the example given for Weakness requires criticism or pointing out limitations. The passage says they found different symptoms, which might indicate Weakness if the cited study's methods are flawed. Neutral could come in if it's just describing findings without critique, but here there's a contrast, so it's more CoCoRes and possibly Weakness. 

Ranking the top three: CoCoRes is first, then maybe Weakness if there's critique, and Neutral as secondary. Wait, the example for Weakness has the cited work's results being problematic. Here, the authors found contrasting results, possibly indicating a weakness in the citation's work's explanation. So Weakness might be appropriate. Neutral could be third if there's a neutral statement, but the context is about comparison. So likely CoCoRes first, Neutral if there's a neutral comparison too, but the example for Neutral is just a statement without argument. Hmm. The primary is CoCoRes, secondary Weakness if critique, third maybe CoCoGM if comparing methods, but there's no mention of methods. Maybe CoCoXY since it's about conflicting results between studies? Wait, CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies with each other. In the example, Wei et al and Saracco et al were compared. Here, the citation is compared between their study and the cited one (2017), so CoCoRes applies. Then Weakness could be if citing limitations. Neutral is if it's just stating their findings. Let me recheck the definitions. CoCoRes is direct comparison between citing paper and cited work. In the example, the present work differs from the cited experiments. Here, they found different symptoms when host susceptibility was involved, contrasting with the cited study. That's CoCoRes. Also, the cited study's finding about graft compatibility contradicts theirs, which might be Weakness. Neutral would be if it's descriptive. So CoCoRes first, then Weakness as secondary, Neutral third? Or Neutral might not be applicable here. Alternatively, maybe CoCoRes is first, CoCoXY is third if comparing two studies mentioned. But the cited work here is just one study compared to theirs. I think the top three are CoCoRes, Weakness, and then maybe Neutral if the initial statement is neutral. Wait, the opening sentence is neutral? Like, stating findings, but then contrasting. Hmm. Maybe Neutral isn't the right third. Maybe CoCoRes is first, Weakness second, and then Neutral third if there's no comparison. But Neutral's example is a statement without argument. So in this context, the first part is descriptive but contrasting, so Neutral is not the right third. The primary is CoCoRes, then Weakness if critique, then maybe CoCoXY if comparing two cited works? Wait, in the passage cited is the 2017 study and their own, so CoCoRes. Then Weakness might be third. Neutral might not fit here. So the top three classes are CoCoRes, Weakness, and Neutral? But Neutral isn't clearly present. Maybe CoCoRes is first, Weakness second, and maybe Neutral third isn't fitting. Hmm. Or perhaps Neutral isn't appropriate here. Wait, the example for Neutral is stating facts without argument. The current passage is contrasting results with citation, so Neutral isn't the case. So perhaps CoCoRes is first, Weakness is second, and maybe another CoCo? Maybe Neutral isn't in the top three. Wait, the instructions say to pick three from the list, and Neutral is possible. Maybe CoCoRes is first, Weakness is second, Neutral is third if there's any neutral description. Let me re-examine the passage.

The passage says "However, the results obtained in our experiments with compatible grafts contradicted the cited work." Wait, maybe that's Weakness. CoCoRes is comparing their results to the cited's. The cited study's explanation contradicts theirs, so Weakness. So CoCoRes is first. Then Weakness as second. And maybe Neutral if the first sentence is neutral, like stating their findings. But the first sentence is about their findings conflicting, so maybe Neutral isn't there. Hmm, perhaps Neutral isn't applicable here. Then maybe CoCoRes, Weakness, and CoCoRes again? No. Alternatively, maybe CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Neutral. Wait, CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies. The example compares two cited studies. In this passage, the citation is the only cited study being compared to the author's own work. So CoCoXY isn't applicable here. So the top three are CoCoRes, Weakness, and Neutral? But Neutral may not fit. Hmm. The example given for CoCoRes includes direct comparison of results between cited work and current paper. Here, that's happening. Then Weakness applies if they are pointing out a flaw in the cited work's explanation. The example for Weakness mentions taxonomic issues. Here, pointing out conflicting results might indicate Weakness. Neutral would be if they're just stating their own findings without critique. So perhaps the classes are CoCoRes first, Weakness second, and then maybe Support or Similar if there's a similarity part. Wait, Support would be confirming, but here they're contradicting. So perhaps the top three are CoCoRes, Weakness, Neutral isn't applicable. Wait, maybe Neutral is not part of the top three, so CoCoRes, Weakness, and then maybe another CoCo? Hmm, maybe CoCoXY isn't applicable. Alternatively, if there's Neutral in the context when the citation is just described. But the context is contrasting results. Therefore, perhaps the top three are CoCoRes, Weakness, and then another category, but Neutral might not be in. Given the instructions require three, perhaps CoCoRes first, Weakness second, Neutral third, even if Neutral's presence isn't strong. Let me go with CoCoRes, Weakness, Neutral based on the example provided where contrasting led to Weakness and CoCoRes.
