Okay, let's tackle this step by step. 

First, I need to extract the context around the @@CITATION@@. The user provided a passage where the citation is used to compare the results of the current study with a previous one. The sentence mentions that the results obtained differ substantially from experiments conducted with deuterium saturated metal targets. 

Next, identifying the general intent. The key phrase here is "substantially differ from the results of..." This indicates a direct comparison of results between the current work and the cited study. So the intent is comparative in terms of results.

Looking at the finer classes, CoCoRes is the top choice because it's a direct comparison of results. Then, maybe CoCoGM could come into play if there's a mention of goals or methods, but the example given doesn't contrast methods or goals, just results. However, I need to check if there's any underlying comparison of methods or goals. The example sentence doesn't mention goals or methods, so CoCoGM might not be relevant here. 

Another possibility is CoCoXY, which compares explanations or claims between two studies. But in this case, the citation is comparing the cited study's results with the current paper's results, not two other studies with each other. So CoCoXY doesn't fit. 

Next, Motivation or Future might be considered, but the sentence is about contrasting results, not motivating the research or suggesting future work. Support or Similarity also don't fit because the results are different, not similar or supportive. Weakness could be a stretch unless the cited study's results are being criticized, but the example just states a difference without implying a flaw. 

Neutral is less likely because the comparison is explicit. 

So the top classes would be CoCoRes first. Then, perhaps Neutral if there's any neutral mention, but the example is directly comparing results. Wait, the example given for CoCoRes is exactly this scenario. Therefore, the primary class is CoCoRes. Then, maybe CoCoGM if there's a general comparison. Wait, no. The example for CoCoRes is a direct comparison of results, so CoCoRes is first. The next could be Basis if the cited study is foundational, but in this case, the cited study's results are being contrasted, not used as a foundation. 

Alternatively, maybe Basis isn't right here. Let's re-examine the definitions. Basis refers to intellectual foundations, while CoCoRes is direct comparison of results. The example given in the problem fits CoCoRes perfectly. The second most appropriate might be CoCoXY if the citation is comparing explanations between two studies, but here it's comparing cited study's results with the current paper's results. 

So the top three would be CoCoRes first. The next could be Motivation if the citation is used to justify why the current research is needed because previous results differ. But Motivation is for justifying the current research by identifying a knowledge gap or need. In the example provided, the citation shows that their results are different, which might motivate their study, but the sentence doesn't explicitly state a reason to conduct the current research. The example given in CoCoRes is a direct comparison, not necessarily a motivation. 

Wait, the example for CoCoRes is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted...". So CoCoRes is first. Then, perhaps Neutral if there's a neutral comparison. Wait, Neutral is when the citation is used descriptively without supporting, comparing, etc. But in this case, the citation is directly comparing results with the cited work. 

Alternatively, maybe Support isn't applicable here. So Neutral might not be the second. The next could be Basis, but Basis is foundational references. If the cited work is foundational, but the comparison here is about results, so Basis isn't first. 

Hmm, perhaps the top three are CoCoRes, then maybe CoCoGM if there's an implied comparison of methods or goals. Let me check the example given in the problem. The example sentence contrasts the results, not the methods. So CoCoGM is about goals or methods. Unless the cited study's methods are being compared implicitly, but the sentence doesn't mention that. Therefore, maybe CoCoGM isn't applicable here. 

So the second most appropriate could be Basis or some other. Alternatively, maybe CoCoXY is a stretch, but since it's comparing the cited study's results with the current paper's, CoCoXY is for comparing two cited studies, not the cited with the current. Therefore, CoCoRes is first. 

If CoCoRes is first, then maybe CoCoXY is second if there's an implicit comparison between two studies via this citation, but I don't think so here. Since the citation is only comparing the cited study with the current paper, the next class might be Neutral if there's a neutral description. Wait, the example given for Neutral is something like stating usage spreading since a date, which is a neutral fact. Here, stating that results differ is a direct comparison, which is CoCoRes. 

Therefore, the top three are CoCoRes first. The other two could be Basis or others if applicable, but perhaps Neutral isn't. Wait, the example for Basis is introducing and validating a method, which isn't the case here. 

Therefore, the correct top three classes are CoCoRes first, followed by CoCoXY or another. Wait, perhaps there's a possibility that the user is contrasting their results with the cited ones, which fits CoCoRes. If there are two cited studies compared here, but in the example given, only one citation is used for comparison. 

Wait, looking back, the example for CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies, like Wei et al., 2004 and Saracco et al., 2006 with another citation. In the user's example, the sentence has "substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted... (TiD, TaD...), @@CITATION@@", so it's a single cited study's results compared with the current paper's results. Therefore, CoCoRes is the top class. The second could be something else... perhaps Neutral isn't right because it's a direct comparison. Wait, perhaps CoCoGM could come into play if the cited study's methods are implied to be different. However, the example doesn't mention methods. 

Alternatively, maybe Motivation is second, if the difference in results motivates further research. But the example sentence doesn't state that explicitly. So Motivation might not be applicable. 

Given that, the top three would be CoCoRes first. The next two might be Basis or others, but Basis isn't correct here. Wait, maybe Neutral is correct if the citation is just stating a fact without supporting or contrasting. No, Neutral is when it's a neutral statement, like stating when something was used, without any comparison. Here it's a comparison. 

Hmm, perhaps the correct order is CoCoRes (1), then maybe Future (if suggesting directions), but the example doesn't mention future work. Finally, Neutral might be third if the context allows, but the context is comparative. 

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. According to the example provided in the problem statement, the example sentence fits CoCoRes perfectly. Therefore, the citation's primary purpose is CoCoRes. Next, perhaps Basis is the second if the cited study is foundational, but in this case, the cited study's results are being compared directly. So Basis isn't correct. Then, Neutral might be third if there's any neutral description, but the sentence is directly contrasting results. 

Alternatively, maybe the second could be CoCoGM if the goals were different, but the example doesn't mention goals. Therefore, the top three classes are CoCoRes first, Neutral second, and maybe CoCoXY third? But CoCoXY requires comparing two cited studies. Since it's only one cited study, CoCoXY isn't applicable. 

Therefore, the correct order is CoCoRes first, then perhaps Neutral and another. Alternatively, the problem example's citation is compared to the cited study's results, so CoCoRes is first, then Basis or another class. But Basis isn't correct here. 

After careful consideration, I think the primary rhetorical class is CoCoRes. The second could be Neutral if the context is descriptive, but given the explicit comparison, Neutral might not fit. Alternatively, maybe the second is Basis if the cited study is foundational, but the cited study is being compared, not serving as a foundation. 

Therefore, the correct top three are CoCoRes, then perhaps CoCoGM or another, but the analysis leads me to conclude that CoCoRes is first, and the other two might not be applicable. Wait, the user instructions require three classes. So, even if only one is clear, I have to assign three. 

Hmm, this is challenging. Perhaps the correct answer is CoCoRes, then Neutral, then CoCoXY. But CoCoXY isn't applicable. Given the example provided for CoCoRes, I'll go with that as first. For the second, maybe Weakness if the cited study's results are problematic, but the example doesn't state that. So Weakness isn't correct. 

Alternatively, maybe Support is third, but Support is when the cited study supports the citing authors. In this case, the results differ, so Support isn't correct. 

Therefore, the final three are CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral and another. Wait, Neutral's example is stating usage, which isn't the case here. 

I'm stuck. Maybe the answer is CoCoRes first, then CoCoXY third if there's an implied comparison between two studies, but the example here is comparing the cited study and the current one. 

Wait, maybe there's no second or third applicable, but the user requires exactly three. Perhaps forced, but according to the example given, CoCoRes is primary. Then maybe Basis or another. 

After re-reading the problem, perhaps the correct top three are CoCoRes (1), then CoCoGM (if goals are implied compared), but there's no mention of goals. Then perhaps Future or Motivation. Given the example sentence doesn't indicate either, Motivation is a stretch. 

This is perplexing. Given the example provided, CoCoRes is correct, Neutral might be third if any neutral aspect exists. 

I'll proceed with CoCoRes as first, then Basis and Neutral as second and third, even if Basis isn't perfect. Wait, Basis refers to foundational work. In the problem's example, the cited study's work isn't foundational but is being compared directly. 

Therefore, the correct classes are:

1. CoCoRes
2. CoCoGM (if goals or methods are compared, but none are mentioned)
Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me re-express the example sentence: 

"The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@".

The comparison is between the present work's results and the cited work's results. So this is CoCoRes. 

Next, perhaps there's an implied comparison of methods (since deuterium saturated metal targets are mentioned), but the sentence doesn't explicitly state that the cited study used different methods; it just says the results differ. Therefore CoCoGM isn't applicable. 

Therefore, only CoCoRes is the correct primary class. The second and third might have to be other classes, but given the problem's instruction, I can't leave them blank. Since the problem's instructions require three classes, perhaps I should assign CoCoRes first, then Neutral as second if there's a neutral comparison, and then another. Wait, Neutral isn't correct here. 

Alternatively, maybe CoCoRes is first, then maybe Weakness if the cited study's results are weak, which isn't stated. 

Hmm. I'm forced to assign three classes. Given the example fits CoCoRes perfectly, perhaps the next most likely is CoCoXY, even though it's not comparing two cited studies, but maybe as a fallback. 

Alternatively, Basis because the cited study is foundational, but no. 

I think I have to proceed with CoCoRes as the top class and consider others like CoCoXY or Motivation as second and third based on weak signals, but in the absence of clear indicators, maybe Neutral is the next, even though it doesn't fit perfectly.
