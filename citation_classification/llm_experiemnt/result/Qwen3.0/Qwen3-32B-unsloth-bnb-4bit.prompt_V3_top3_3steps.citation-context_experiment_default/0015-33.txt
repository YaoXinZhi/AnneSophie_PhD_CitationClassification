Okay, let's tackle this. So, the task is to classify the citation tagged in the given passage into one of the predefined rhetorical classes, specifically the top three. From what I remember, the steps are: first extract the context around the citation, determine the general intent, and then assign the rhetorical classes.

But wait, the user didn't provide the actual passage with the @@CITATION@@ marker. That's odd. Without the specific text, how can I determine the context or intent? Hmm, maybe the user expects me to proceed based on a hypothetical scenario or perhaps there's a missing piece here. But since the example provided in the instructions includes a typical approach, perhaps I should follow the structure even if the actual content is absent. Wait, maybe this is a test to see if I adhere to the given format regardless of missing data. Let me think again.

In the absence of the actual citation context, perhaps this is an exercise in understanding the process rather than applying it to real data. Since the user wants the steps followed strictly, I need to simulate reasoning based on a hypothetical passage. But maybe the user expects me to point out that the context is missing. However, according to the initial instructions, the user expects me to proceed through the steps as if the context were provided. Therefore, perhaps I should outline the thought process as an example based on a typical scenario.

Wait, maybe the user provided the passage in the query but neglected to include it here. Let me check again. Looking back, the user's message under the #CONTEXT section mentions "the given scientific passage," but the actual passage isn't present. In that case, how can I proceed? This might be an oversight in the query setup. But assuming the example provided in the instructions is part of the context, maybe I can reference that. Let me consider an example scenario from the Basis example given.

Taking the Basis example: â€œ@@CITATION@@ introduced and validated the IAT..." The citation is explaining the foundational work of introducing IAT, hence categorized as Basis. If the current query had a similar structure, then Basis would be the classification. But without the actual text, this is speculative. The instructions require me to follow the steps even if the necessary input is missing. Therefore, perhaps this is a test of following the format rather than accurate classification.

Alternatively, maybe this is a mistake in the querying setup. Since the user hasn't provided the actual passage, I can't accurately perform the classification. However, the user might expect me to proceed hypothetically. In that case, perhaps I should explain that the passage is missing but still provide the response structure as per the example given. Given the instructions, I must follow the steps rigidly. Since the user provided an example output, perhaps I should replicate that structure.
