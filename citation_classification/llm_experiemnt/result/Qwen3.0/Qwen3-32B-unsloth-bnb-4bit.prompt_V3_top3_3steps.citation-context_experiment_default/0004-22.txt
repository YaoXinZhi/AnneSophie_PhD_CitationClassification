Okay, let's tackle this step by step.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation marked @@CITATION@@. The sentence is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@."

So the key part here is that the current paper is comparing their results with those from another study's experiments using specific metal targets. The citation is being referenced to show a difference in results.

Next, identifying the general intent. Since the authors are contrasting their findings with the cited work's results, this falls under Comparative. Specifically, since they're comparing results, not methods or goals, the intent here is to highlight differing outcomes between studies. According to the definitions, Comparative for Results is CoCoRes.

Now, ranking the top three rhetorical classes. The main class here is CoCoRes because the citation is directly contrasting results. Then, maybe CoCoXY if there's a comparison between other studies mentioned as well, but in the example given, it's a direct comparison between their own results and the cited study. However, the example given for CoCoRes matches the structure here, so CoCoRes is definitely first. 

Looking for others, perhaps CoCoXY isn't applicable here because it's a direct comparison between the citing paper and the cited paper, not between two cited studies. Then, maybe Neutral isn't right either since there's a clear comparison of results. Support might not fit because they are contrasting instead of supporting. The other options like Weakness or Motivation don't seem to apply. Future isn't relevant here either. Neutral is when it's just mentioned descriptively without any specific argumentation. 

Wait, in this case, the authors are stating their results differ, so they're contrasting their results against the cited ones. That's purely CoCoRes. Are there other classes? Maybe Neutral could be third if there's no other context. But the example given for CoCoRes matches this case exactly. So first is CoCoRes. Then maybe CoCoGM or CoCoXY if there's any other comparative aspect. But since the example only mentions their own work versus the cited one, the other classes might not apply here. 

Hmm, maybe Neutral is a possible third if there's no other context. But the question asks for the top three. Based on the context, only CoCoRes is directly applicable here. But maybe the others like Basis, CoCoGM, Motivation, etc., aren't fitting.

Wait, perhaps CoCoGM could be a close second if there's a comparison of methods implicitly. But in the sentence, they mention comparing results, so CoCoRes is the primary. Basis isn't right because they're not establishing foundational context but contrasting findings. 

Thus, the top three would be CoCoRes first, then maybe Similar if there's a similarity mentioned elsewhere. Wait, the example here explicitly states "substantially differ", so Similar doesn't fit. Neutral might be third if there's no other context. 

Wait, the example given for CoCoRes is exactly matching the sentence structure here. The example says "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from... (citation)". The answer for that example is CoCoRes. In our case, the sentence is the same structure. So the primary class is CoCoRes. Then, perhaps the next could be Basis or Neutral. But in the example for CoCoRes, only that class is mentioned, but maybe the user wants three classes. Since the context is purely comparative, maybe the other two are similar or neutral. Hmm. Maybe Neutral is third. But I'm not sure if Neutral applies here. Neutral is when the citation is just described factually without argumentation. But here, they're using the citation to compare results. So Neutral probably isn't applicable. Wait, the example in CoCoXY compares two cited studies, not the citing paper and cited one. So in this case, only CoCoRes applies. However, the user asked for three classes, so maybe two others are possible. But given the information here, maybe CoCoRes is the only applicable one. However, the task requires three. Perhaps the other two are similar or Neutral. But given the sentence, the most accurate is CoCoRes first. I need to pick three. Maybe CoCoRes is first, then CoCoGM as second if there's a comparison of methods, but the sentence talks about results. Alternatively, Future might not fit. Maybe Weakness isn't right. Perhaps Neutral. Maybe Neutral is third if there's a descriptive mention. But in the example provided under CoCoRes, the three top classes might be CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Neutral. Wait, that example is about conflicting results in different studies. In the user's case, the sentence is comparing their results with one cited study. So perhaps the third class could be similar or Neutral. I'm a bit stuck here. Since the user's examples only show one class, maybe the answer here is CoCoRes, then perhaps Neutral, and maybe another. Hmm. Given the instructions, perhaps the correct ranking is CoCoRes as first, then maybe Basis as second if the cited work is foundational for the comparison. But the sentence isn't stating that the cited study is foundational but just contrasting results. Alternatively, maybe the answer is CoCoRes first, then Weakness if the authors are pointing out a flaw in the cited work. But the sentence says "substantially differ", not criticize. So Weakness isn't correct. Neutral again, maybe not. Based on the example given, perhaps the correct answer is CoCoRes first, Neutral second, and something else third. But I might need to refer back to the instructions. The problem is to return exactly three distinct labels. Given the context is a direct comparison of results, CoCoRes is first. Since there's no other clear intent, maybe Neutral is second and Basis third. Wait, Basis is when it's foundational. So in this case, maybe CoCoRes is first, then maybe CoCoXY if comparing multiple studies, but the sentence refers to one citation. So perhaps CoCoRes is first, then Neutral as second, and maybe similar as third. Wait, the example for CoCoXY involves comparing two cited studies. The current context is comparing their own results to a cited one. So CoCoRes is definitely first, then maybe Basis if the cited study is part of the foundation. But the sentence isn't establishing foundation but comparison. Hmm. I'm not sure. According to the instructions, after extracting context and identifying intent as Comparative, the specific classes under Comparative are CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY. Since the context here is a direct comparison of results between the citing paper and the cited one, CoCoRes is the best fit. The other two classes under Comparative would be CoCoGM and CoCoXY. Since the sentence doesn't mention comparing goals or methods, CoCoGM isn't applicable. CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies, which isn't happening here either. So maybe CoCoRes is first, then perhaps two others not under Comparative. But that's unlikely. Wait, the task says to rank top three from the predefined list, which includes all classes. Given that the context is purely a comparison of results, CoCoRes is first. The other two could be Neutral and maybe something else. Neutral would be the citation being used descriptively, but in this case, it's being used to contrast results, which is a specific comparative function. Therefore, Neutral might not fit. Wait, maybe the answer is CoCoRes, then CoCoXY, then Neutral. But CoCoXY is comparing cited studies to each other, not the citing paper and a cited one. Hmm. This is confusing. Maybe the answer is CoCoRes first, then Neutral second, then maybe another comparative class third, but I'm not certain. Given the example in the task matches exactly the context here, and the example uses CoCoRes as the correct class, perhaps the answer is CoCoRes as first, and then maybe Neutral and Basis as second and third if that's forced. Alternatively, maybe the answer is CoCoRes first, Neutral second, and CoCoGM third. I'm not entirely confident, but based on the strict example given, the primary class is CoCoRes, followed by Neutral, then perhaps CoCoGM. But I'm not sure. Let me check again. The example under CoCoRes has a sentence where results differ from the cited work's experiments. The correct classes listed in that example are CoCoRes. So in the current case, the correct answer is CoCoRes as first. Since the task asks for three classes ranked, maybe the other two are related to Comparative. Since the context is purely CoCoRes, the next might be CoCoXY (if comparing two cited studies) but that's not happening here. Maybe Neutral is third if there's a descriptive aspect. For example, if the citation is used to describe experiments done before, but in this context, it's being used as a point of comparison. Therefore, Neutral might not fit. Maybe the third is Basis. Hmm. I'm stuck. Given the instructions, perhaps the answer is CoCoRes as first, Neutral as second, and Basis as third. I'll have to make an educated guess here.
