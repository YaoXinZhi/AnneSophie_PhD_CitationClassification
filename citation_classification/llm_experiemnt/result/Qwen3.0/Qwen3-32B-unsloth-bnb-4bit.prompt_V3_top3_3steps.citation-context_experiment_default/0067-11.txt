Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the rhetorical classes for the citation marked here. The step is to first extract the context around the citation. The sentence says, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets @@CITATION@.@ In this part, the authors are comparing their results to those from a previous study. 

So, the general intent here is comparative because they're contrasting their findings with someone else's. From the list, comparative leads to classes like CoCoRes, CoCoGM, or CoCoXY. Looking at the example for CoCoRes, it's when you directly compare results. The example sentence has similar wording: "The results... substantially differ from..." which matches CoCoRes.

Then, maybe there's also a Neutral aspect because they're just stating a fact without strong support or criticism. Also, Basis might come into play if they're referencing foundational work, but in this case, it's more about comparing results rather than setting a foundation. Future or Motivation don't seem relevant here. Weakness isn't present because they're not criticizing the cited work but pointing out differences.

So the top three would likely be CoCoRes first, then Neutral maybe second if they're just neutral description, and perhaps a third class like CoCoGM? Wait, CoCoGM is about comparing goals or methods, but the sentence specifically mentions results. So maybe CoCoRes is first, then Neutral if the comparison is neutral, and possibly Similar? But they're contrasting, not similar. Hmm. Wait, no Similar is when they point out similarities, CoCoXY is comparing explanations or claims between two cited works. Here it's the current work's results vs. cited results. So CoCoRes is the primary class. The rest might be Neutral as a fallback. So the ranking would be CoCoRes first, then Neutral, maybe CoCoXY as third? No, CoCoXY is between two cited studies. So perhaps Neutral third here if there's no other relevant category. So the final three would be CoCoRes, then Neutral, and maybe Support, but Support is when they confirm their own work with the citation. So probably Neutral is the next. Maybe Weakness is not applicable here. So the answer is CoCoRes first, then Neutral second, perhaps Basis third? Wait, Basis is foundational references. Since they are comparing results, Basis isn't the case. So the top three are CoCoRes, Neutral, and maybe something else, but I can't think of a better fit. Maybe Future? No. So the top three are 1. CoCoRes, 2. Neutral, 3. CoCoGM. Wait, the example for CoCoGM is about methods or goals. The sentence here is about results. So CoCoGM isn't correct. Maybe Weakness? The authors aren't criticizing the cited work's results but just stating their own differ. Weakness would imply the cited work is flawed, which isn't mentioned here. So maybe the top three are CoCoRes first, then Neutral second, and Support third? But Support is when the citation supports the citing paper's work. Since this is a difference, Support is the opposite. So Neutral might be second, and maybe Motivation? Like perhaps the differing results motivate their work. But the example for Motivation involves justifying the current research because of a knowledge gap. In this case, the difference might be part of the motivation, but the example given doesn't fit exactly. However the example cited is comparing results and pointing out they differ, so Motivation might not be present. So the best answer is CoCoRes as first, Neutral as second, and maybe CoCoXY? No, CoCoXY is comparing two cited works. So the answer is CoCoRes first, Neutral second, and perhaps... maybe there's no third here. Wait, the user wants top three. So after CoCoRes and Neutral, perhaps something else. Wait, the example in CoCoXY has conflicting results between two citations. Here the comparison is between the current work and the cited work. Since CoCoXY is between two cited works, maybe Neutral is second, then maybe Weakness? But again, no criticism is implied. Hmm. Maybe I should stick with CoCoRes as first, Neutral as second, and CoCoGM third? Although the comparison is on results, not goals/methods. Maybe Neutral as third would be better. Wait, maybe only two classes are valid here. But the task requires three. In such cases, the third might be Neutral but perhaps Support? Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps Weakness isn't applicable, Neutral is the most fitting third. So my final output is CoCoRes first, Neutral second, and maybe something else. Wait, looking back, maybe Basis isn't relevant, so Neutral is the third. So the numbered list would be:

1. CoCoRes  
2. Neutral  
3. CoCoGM  

Wait, but CoCoGM is comparing goals or methods. The sentence mentions results, so CoCoGM isn't accurate. Alternatively, maybe the third is Support? But Support is when the citation supports their own findings. Here, it's contrasting, so Support wouldn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps Neutral as the third, even though that's maybe forced. Alternatively, maybe Neutral is the second, and then nothing else. But the instructions require three. So perhaps I'm forced to pick Neutral as second and another. But the example might have only CoCoRes and Neutral. But the example sentence does not have a third class. So maybe Neutral is second, and CoCoXY as third? Wait, CoCoXY is comparing two cited works. The sentence here compares one cited work with current study. So CoCoXY is not applicable. Therefore, perhaps Neutral is the only other possible class. So I'll go with 1. CoCoRes, 2. Neutral, 3. Maybe CoCoGM again even though it's not a perfect fit, or maybe the third class is Weakness? But again, Weakness implies criticism. Hmm. This is tricky. Maybe the correct answer is CoCoRes, Neutral, and Neutral again, but the instructions say top three distinct classes. So perhaps after CoCoRes, Neutral is second, and maybe CoCoXY is third if the comparison is between two cited works. But the example here is between the current work and cited work, so CoCoXY isn't applicable. Alright, maybe I have to accept that only two classes are valid and the third is Neutral. Wait, perhaps the third class is Weakness if the cited work's results are considered problematic. But the sentence says the results differ, which doesn't necessarily imply weakness. So perhaps the third class is Neutral. So the answer is CoCoRes, Neutral, Neutral? But the instructions require distinct classes. Therefore, the third might be Weakness even if it's a stretch. Hmm. Maybe I need to pick CoCoRes, CoCoGM, Neutral. But CoCoGM is not accurate here. Maybe the answer is CoCoRes, Neutral, CoCoXY. Still not accurate. This seems complicated, but given the context, CoCoRes is the most appropriate first class, Neutral second, and perhaps CoCoXY third even if it's not a perfect fit. Or maybe Neutral is the only other class. So the final answer would be 1. CoCoRes, 2. Neutral, 3. CoCoXY. Wait, but the example for CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies. Here, it's the current work versus cited work, so CoCoXY doesn't fit. Therefore, perhaps the third class is something else. Hmm. Maybe Neutral is the second, and then Support is third. But that's conflicting. Given the instructions, I'll proceed with CoCoRes as first, Neutral as second, and maybe CoCoXY as third, even though it's not perfect.
