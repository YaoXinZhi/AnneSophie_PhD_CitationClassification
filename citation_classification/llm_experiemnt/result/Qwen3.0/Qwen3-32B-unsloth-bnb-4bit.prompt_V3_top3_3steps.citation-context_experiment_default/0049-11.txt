Okay, let's start by looking at the given scientific passage and the citation labeled @@CITATION@@.

The passage says, "Fast multiplication rates and high concentration of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains have been reported in young developing leaves and roots of infected daisy plants (Wei et al., 2004; Saracco et al., 2006), although conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima @@CITATION@@." 

First, I need to understand the context around the citation. The authors mention previous studies by Wei et al. and Saracco et al. that found high multiplication rates and concentrations of the strains in certain plant parts. However, they then note conflicting results in a different study on a different plant species, which is cited as @@CITATION@@.

The key here is the phrase "although conflicting results were described." This indicates that the cited study presents results that contradict the earlier findings. Comparing CoCoXYâ€™s definition, which involves contrasting explanations or claims between cited studies without involving the citing paper directly, this seems to fit. The citation is used to compare conflicting results between two studies on different phytoplasma strains and plant species.

Next, CoCoRes would involve comparing results between the cited work and the current paper. However, the passage doesn't directly compare their results with the current study but rather between two cited studies. Therefore, CoCoRes might not be the best fit here.

Neutral is for citations used in a descriptive way without supporting or contrasting arguments. But the mention of conflicting results implies some level of comparison or contrast, so Neutral might not capture the intent accurately.

Looking at other options: Motivation would be if the citation is used to justify the current research, which isn't the case here. Support or Similar also don't align with introducing conflicting findings. Basis is for foundational references, which isn't the case here either. Usage isn't relevant as the cited study's method isn't directly used here.

Thus, CoCoXY is the primary class because the citation is comparing conflicting results between studies. Then, Neutral could be a secondary class if the mention is mostly descriptive, but since it's pointing out a conflict, CoCoXY is still more specific. The third could be CoCoRes if there's any implicit comparison between cited study's results and the current paper, but the passage doesn't indicate that. So maybe Neutral is the third.
