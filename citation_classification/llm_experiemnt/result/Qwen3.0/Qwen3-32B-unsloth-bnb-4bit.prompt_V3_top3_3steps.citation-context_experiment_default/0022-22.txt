Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the top three rhetorical classes for the given citation. First, I'll look at the context around the citation in the passage.

The citation is in a sentence that says, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." The key part here is "substantially differ," which directly compares the results of the current study with another study's results that used different metal targets. 

So the main intent here seems to be comparing results. According to the definitions, CoCoRes is when the citation directly compares the results of the citing paper with the cited work. That definitely fits here because they mention their own results differ from those in the referenced study. 

Next, looking at other possible classes. Does this fall under Basis? No, because the citation isn't establishing a foundation for their work; it's contrasting their results. Could it be Support or Similar? No, since the difference is highlighted rather than support or similarity. CoCoGM or CoCoXY? CoCoGM would relate to goals/methods, which isn't mentioned here. CoCoXY compares two studies but not in terms of explanations or claims. Neutral? Also not Neutral, as it's a direct comparison of results. 

So the primary class is CoCoRes. Then, maybe Neutral as the least relevant because it's not just descriptive but comparative. Future or Motivation? Doesn't fit those either. So the top three would be CoCoRes as first, followed by Neutral and CoCoGM as second and third, respectively? Wait, no. Wait, maybe CoCoGM isn't applicable here. Let me check again. The CoCoGM is about comparing goals or methods, but the sentence is about results, not goals or methods. CoCoXY compares two cited studies but here it's between the current and cited work. So Neutral might come next if there's a neutral mention, but the sentence is actively contrasting results. Hmm. If the primary is CoCoRes, maybe the next could be CoCoXY if there's a comparison between cited studies, but here it's between cited work and current work. Wait, maybe Weakness? The cited work's results are being contrasted, but not criticized. Just shown as different. So Weakness isn't right. Neutral is when it's descriptive without argument. But the authors are arguing their results are different, which is a specific comparison. So CoCoRes is the main one. The second could be Basis if the cited work is foundational, but here it's a direct comparison. So maybe CoCoRes is first, then Neutral if the rest is descriptive, but Neutral example was when they just mention something occurred without argument. Here they argue their results differ. Hmm. Maybe Neutral isn't applicable. Then perhaps Future is not here. Maybe there's nothing else. Wait, the example of Neutral given is when the citation is mentioned without a strong argument, like "has been spreading since 1975." But here the authors are actively contrasting results, so CoCoRes is primary. The second and third are harder. Maybe there's nothing else. Are there possible overlaps? Or perhaps the citation is comparing their own results with another study's, so CoCoRes is the top. But maybe CoCoXY is when comparing two studies with each other, not with the citing paper. So this example is CoCoRes. Then next classes might be Basis or something else. Wait, maybe Basis is if the cited work is the foundation. So perhaps Neutral is third? But not sure. Maybe Neutral is only if there's no comparison, support, criticism. Since the primary is CoCoRes, then perhaps Neutral is not applicable. So maybe second is Weakness, but Weakness is when they criticize the cited work. Here, they just state differences. So Weakness isn't right. Hmm. Maybe CoCoRes is the only applicable here. But the task requires listing three, so perhaps Neutral and Basis are forced in as lower ranks. Let me think again. The sentence is directly contrasting their results with another study's. So CoCoRes is first. Then, maybe Neutral is possible if the citation is just mentioned factually, but since they're pointing out a contrast, perhaps Neutral isn't. Alternatively, maybe Basis is relevant if the cited work is foundational to their comparison. But here, the cited work isn't foundational but rather another experiment they're contrasting against. So Basis might not fit. Maybe Neutral is third. Wait, but the example of Neutral is when they mention something occurred without a specific argument. Here, the citation is used to show a difference, which is a specific argument. So Neutral isn't right. Then perhaps Weakness isn't applicable. Hmm. This is tricky. Maybe the top three could be CoCoRes first, and the others have to be from what's left. Maybe CoCoRes, then Similar? No, because Similar would be when they point out similarity, not difference. Hmm. Maybe CoCoRes is first, then nothing else fits, but the user wants three. Maybe the second is CoCoGM even if not accurate? No. Alternatively, perhaps the example given in CoCoXY mentions comparing two cited studies, but this example is comparing cited work to the citing paper. So CoCoRes is first. Then, perhaps CoCoGM is not applicable. Neutral is third. But Neutral seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the rest of the sentence besides the comparison part is Neutral? The sentence states the materials used (deuterium saturated metal targets) and then cites a study. The part about materials is factual and maybe Neutral. So maybe the entire sentence is Neutral because it's describing methods but then they compare results. This is confusing. The correct answer here is definitely CoCoRes as first. Then perhaps similar is second? No. Maybe Neutral third? But I'm not sure. Alright, given the instructions, the top three are CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral second, then CoCoGM third as possible leftovers. But that might not be accurate. Wait, maybe Neutral isn't correct here. Let me re-express the example given for CoCoRes. The example says "substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted..." which matches the given sentence. So CoCoRes is correct first. Are there other possible classes that could apply? I'm stuck. Let's proceed with CoCoRes first, Neutral second (if needed), and maybe nothing else. Wait, the task requires three classes even if some are not perfect. Maybe the next is CoCoXY if comparing explanations, but the sentence isn't comparing explanations. Hmm. Maybe the correct top three is CoCoRes, then maybe Neutral (as the least relevant), and then something else. Alternatively, maybe Weakness isn't correct. Alright, the answer should be CoCoRes, then Neutral, but maybe Neutral isn't accurate here. Wait, Neutral would be when the citation is used descriptively without argument. Here they are contrasting results, which is an argument, so Neutral isn't correct. So perhaps the correct top three is only CoCoRes, and the others are not applicable. But I have to select three. Maybe I'm missing other possibilities. For example, if the cited work is foundational, maybe CoCoRes could also be a form of support or similar? No, since it's highlighting differences. Maybe there's no second or third classes. But the instructions require three. Hmm. Maybe CoCoRes is first, and then Basis or Support as forced. Wait, maybe Basis is when the cited work is the foundation. This cited work is being contrasted, so Basis is not correct. Maybe CoCoXY if comparing two cited works but in the example given, CoCoXY says comparing two cited studies, but here it's between cited study and citing paper. Therefore, CoCoXY isn't applicable. Therefore, the top three is CoCoRes first, and perhaps Neutral second and Basis third, even though it's not perfect. But this is forced due to the task requirement. Given the instructions, maybe the correct answer is 1. CoCoRes, 2. Neutral, 3. Basis or something else. I'm going to proceed with the first being CoCoRes, then Neutral as second, then maybe Basis as third, even if unsure.
