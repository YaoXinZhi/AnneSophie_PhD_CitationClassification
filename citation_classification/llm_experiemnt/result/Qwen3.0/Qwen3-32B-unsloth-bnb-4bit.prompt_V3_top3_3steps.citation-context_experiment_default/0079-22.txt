Okay, let me tackle this problem step by step. So, the user wants me to classify the citation marked @@CITATION@@ into three rhetorical classes based on the context provided.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." The key part here is comparing the current results with those from the cited study.

Next, identify the general intent. The phrase "substantially differ from" indicates a direct comparison of results. So the intent is Comparative, specifically related to Results. According to the definitions, CoCoRes is for comparing results between the current paper and the cited work. 

Now, looking at the examples provided for CoCoRes, the structure matches the example given, where results are directly compared. The other possible classes might include Neutral if the citation is just mentioned without specific comparison, but here it's a clear contrast. There's no mention of supporting or motivating the current work, nor is it about methods or goals. The primary classification here is CoCoRes. The second and third classes could be CoCoXY if there's a comparison between two cited studies, but in this case, there's only one citation mentioned (the experiments with deuterium targets). There's no other study cited here. So perhaps Neutral might come in third, but since the author is directly contrasting their results with the cited ones, Neutral isn't the case here. Wait, maybe the Neutral example is when the citation is just a fact without direct argumentation. Here, the comparison is direct, so Neutral isn't applicable. However, maybe CoCoGM isn't fitting because it's about goals/methods. The third class might be Motivation or Support, but there's no indication of that. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe Weakness? The author states their results differ substantially, but they don't necessarily criticize the cited work's validity. The example for Weakness involves pointing out limitations or flaws in the cited work. Since the citation here is used to compare results without criticism, the correct primary class is CoCoRes, and the others like CoCoXY or Neutral might not apply. Wait, but the Neutral example is when the citation is neutral, like stating a fact without argument. In this case, the citation is used to contrast results, so CoCoRes is most specific. The second and third classes could perhaps be CoCoXY or Neutral. However, since CoCoXY is for comparing two cited studies, which isn't happening here, and Neutral is when there's no direct argumentation. So maybe CoCoRes is first, then Neutral (but maybe not). Wait, the example given for Neutral is a descriptive citation without supporting or comparing. In this case, the comparison is direct. So perhaps the top three are CoCoRes, and maybe the rest are CoCoGM or Motivation? No. Since the author is contrasting results, the primary is CoCoRes, and perhaps CoCoXY isn't applicable here. Wait, CoCoXY is when comparing two cited studies, which isn't the case here. So the only relevant class here is CoCoRes. Then, maybe Weakness is not applicable unless the author is criticizing the cited work. Since the author says "substantially differ," but isn't questioning the validity of the cited study's results, perhaps Weakness isn't right. So the primary class is CoCoRes. Are there any secondary classes? Maybe Neutral is not here. Maybe Future or Motivation? No, the citation isn't suggesting future work or motivating the current work. The author is contrasting their own results against the cited study's. Therefore, the top three classes would be CoCoRes (first), CoCoXY (but no, since only one study is cited here), maybe Neutral isn't here. Wait, maybe the top three classes are just CoCoRes. But the instructions require three, so I might need to pick the most fitting ones even if the next two are less certain. Alternatively, perhaps Neutral is the third class if it's used descriptively, but given the context is comparing results, Neutral doesn't fit. Hmm. Maybe CoCoGM is not applicable either. Maybe the only applicable class is CoCoRes, and the other two could be Neutral or Future. Wait, perhaps there's an implicit motivation in pointing out the difference, but the example for Motivation uses "justifying why the current research is being conducted." In this case, it's more about showing a contrast in results rather than justifying motivation. So maybe the top is CoCoRes, then perhaps CoCoGM as the second if the methods are different. Wait, the citation mentions the experiments conducted with deuterium saturated metal targets. The methods might be different (since they used those targets), but the author's intent is comparing the results. The CoCoGM is for comparing goals or methods. The sentence structure says their results differ from experiments using different targets. If the author is comparing methods (different targets), but the focus is on results. Hmm. The example for CoCoGM compares methods between citing and cited papers. Here, the cited study's method involves specific targets (TiD, TaD, etc.), and the current study might be different. If the author is contrasting methods, then CoCoGM is possible. But the phrase "the results obtained... differ from the results of the experiments conducted with..." suggests that the methods (different targets) are causing the difference in results. So maybe CoCoGM is secondary. Then, Neutral could be the third class. Wait, but Neutral is when the citation is neutral, not supporting or comparing. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe CoCoRes is first, CoCoGM is second, and Neutral third. But I need to check the examples. The CoCoGM example says "Most closely related to this paper is concurrent work by ... who propose a method to debias word embeddings. Our work is complementary..." So comparing methods. In this case, the cited work's method involves deuterium targets, and the current study's experiments might differ in method (using different targets), leading to different results. So the author is contrasting methods leading to different results, which would be CoCoGM. However, the example for CoCoRes compares results directly. So the author's main intent is comparing results, but the difference arises from differing methods. So the primary class is CoCoRes, and secondary may be CoCoGM. However, the sentence structure focuses on the results differing, so CoCoRes is primary. The citation is not being used to compare the methods (the methods are mentioned in the citation as using certain targets, but the main point is the results difference). Therefore, CoCoRes is the top class. The other classes could be CoCoXY if comparing two studies, but there's only one citation here. Maybe Weakness isn't applicable. If there's no other class fitting, then perhaps Neutral is third. Alternatively, maybe Future. Hmm. The example for Future is suggesting directions for future research, which isn't the case here. So Neutral might be third, but Neutral's example is stating a fact without argumentation. In this case, the author is making a comparison, so Neutral might not be appropriate. Therefore, perhaps the top three classes are CoCoRes (1), CoCoXY (not applicable since only one citation), CoCoGM (if methods are compared). But the citation mentions different methods as part of explaining why results differ. The exact phrase is "the results obtained... differ from the results of the experiments conducted with...", so the methods aren't directly compared but the results are contrasting. Therefore, CoCoRes is the highest, and perhaps CoCoGM isn't necessary. But the task requires three classes, so maybe after CoCoRes, Neutral could be second, but Neutral is more descriptive. Alternatively, perhaps Weakness is third if the author critiques the cited work. But the author doesn't say the cited work's results are flawed; they just differ. So Weakness isn't applicable. Therefore, the top three might be CoCoRes, possibly Neutral, but I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps Neutral isn't here. Maybe the answer is CoCoRes (1), CoCoXY (not), then CoCoGM. Hmm. Maybe the answer is CoCoRes first, then CoCoGM second, then perhaps CoCoXY third, but I think that's not applicable. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me look back at the example for CoCoRes. The example given is similar: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted...", which is exactly like the user's example. The example uses CoCoRes. So the correct primary class is CoCoRes. The second and third classes could be CoCoGM if methods are being compared indirectly. But perhaps in this case, the author is highlighting the difference in results due to different methods, which would suggest both CoCoRes and CoCoGM. However, the main intent is comparing results. Therefore, the primary class is CoCoRes. For the second class, maybe CoCoXY isn't applicable. If the citation is only comparing two results, the second class could be CoCoXY if it's part of a broader comparison of two studies, but the cited study is the only one mentioned here. Therefore, perhaps the second class is Neutral. Wait, Neutral isn't fitting here. Alternatively, maybe Weakness isn't here. Hmm. Maybe the answer is CoCoRes (1), Weakness (2), Neutral (3), but that's not supported. Wait, perhaps the author is indicating a difference in results, which could imply some limitation in the previous study's findings if their methods (different targets) lead to different results. However, the author doesn't state the previous study's methods are flawed; they're different. Therefore, Weakness isn't appropriate. So maybe the correct answer is CoCoRes as first, and the other two classes could be Neutral and something else. But Neutral isn't applicable since there's a direct comparison. Therefore, perhaps the top three are CoCoRes, CoCoGM, and Neutral. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the second most applicable is CoCoGM if the methods are compared implicitly. Since the experiments in the citation used different targets (TiD, TaD, etc.), which might be a key difference. So the author is comparing results that arose from different methods (different targets). Therefore, the comparison includes both methods and results, making CoCoGM and CoCoRes both applicable. But CoCoRes is more specific to comparing results, so it's first. Then perhaps CoCoGM is second. CoCoGM is comparisons of goals or methods. However, the sentence doesn't explicitly state that the goals or methods are different; it's inferred from the context of different results. Hmm. Given the strict definitions, CoCoGM is when the author is comparing the research goals or methods between the cited work and the current paper. The current sentence mentions different experimental setups (different targets) leading to different results. If the author's intent is to compare the methods (different targets) that caused the results to differ, then CoCoGM is secondary. Otherwise, if it's purely about results, then CoCoGM isn't needed. However, the mention of "different targets" suggests a methodological comparison. Therefore, the top three could be CoCoRes (1), CoCoGM (2), Neutral (but Neutral isn't here). Alternatively, maybe Weakness isn't applicable. I think this is a case of CoCoRes first. Since the instructions require three classes, and the best possible next is CoCoGM if the methods are considered. Therefore, the final classes are CoCoRes (1), CoCoGM (2), Neutral (3). Wait, but Neutral isn't applicable here. The author is making a specific comparison. Maybe Weakness isn't here. Alright, after careful consideration, the correct classes are CoCoRes (1), CoCoGM (2), and Neutral (3), but Neutral might not be fitting. However, given the options, perhaps the third class is CoCoXY, but that's not applicable. I might have to stick with CoCoRes as the first and maybe Neutral as third, even if Neutral isn't perfect here.
