Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to classify the rhetorical purpose of a citation in a scientific passage related to plant health. The citation in question is marked as @@CITATION@@. First, I need to extract the context around this citation.

Looking at the example provided in the passage, the sentence is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets @@CITATION@." 

The key part here is "substantially differ from the results of..." that references the cited work. This indicates that the authors are directly comparing their results with those from the cited study. Based on the step-by-step guidelines, this would fall under comparative intent, specifically comparing results. 

Now, referring to the predefined classes, CoCoRes is for comparisons of results. The example given for CoCoRes actually matches this scenario exactly. The other possible classes in the same category might be CoCoGM or CoCoXY, but those involve comparing methods/goals or explanations/claims respectively. Here, it's the results that are being compared, not methods or explanations. 

Next, checking if there are secondary classes. The citation isn't used for foundational basis, motivation, support, future directions, or weakness. It's not pointing out similarities (Similar), nor is it describing neutral information (Neutral). It's directly contrasting their findings with another study's findings. Hence, CoCoRes would be the primary class. 

Looking for secondary classes: could there be a mention of CoCoXY here? The example for CoCoXY mentions comparing two cited studies with each other, not with the current paper. In this case, the comparison is between the current paper and the cited work, not two cited works. So CoCoCX isn't applicable here. 

Therefore, the top class is CoCoRes. For the third class, maybe Neutral might come in if there's any other aspect, but since the primary intent is clear comparison of results, Neutral isn't applicable here. Hence, the primary is CoCoRes, then perhaps the next classes might be Basis if the citing is foundational, but the example seems to be contrasting results rather than building on foundational work. 

Thus, the top three rhetorical classes would be CoCoRes first, followed by maybe Neutral or Basis. But given the example, CoCoRes is the most accurate, then Neutral if any, but in the given context, the citation is part of a direct result comparison. Wait, the example in CoCoRes is exactly this scenario, so definitely the top is CoCoRes. The next might be Weakness if the cited work's results are being criticized, but the example doesn't criticize; it just states differences. Therefore, Weakness isn't fitting. Hence, it's CoCoRes first, then maybe Neutral as the context states differences without any further critique. Alternatively, if Neutral isn't applicable, the third might be Basis, but unless there's foundational aspect, it's unlikely. 

Finalizing: first CoCoRes, then Neutral if any. Wait, the Neutral example mentions descriptive use without support or critique, but here it's a direct comparison, so Neutral might not apply. Therefore, perhaps CoCoRes is the only one, but the task asks for three. Maybe the passage is using the citation to compare results (CoCoRes) and maybe also to set up a comparison with another study (if CoCoXY), but in this case, the example is comparing their results to the cited study's results. So definitely CoCoRes is first, then Neutral as secondary. Since the example's citation could be Neutral if just describing a study, but since it's contrasting results, CoCoRes is the key. The third might be Basis if the cited study lays the groundwork, but since it's differing results, probably Weakness? Hmm, maybe Weakness if the differences indicate problems with the cited study. The example says "substantially differ", but that's a factual statement, not criticism. So Weakness may not apply. So maybe CoCoRes is first, Neutral as second, and Basis third. But I think Neutral isn't correct here. Wait, Neutral is when the citation is used descriptively without supporting or arguing. Since the passage is stating they differ from the cited study's results, which is a comparison, it's CoCoRes, not Neutral. Therefore, the third might be Basis, CoCoXY, or Motivation, but none fit. Alternatively, perhaps there's an implicit future direction, but that doesn't seem right. 

After re-evaluating, the correct class is CoCoRes first, then perhaps CoCoXY if comparing two studies' explanations, but the passage compares the current study's results with cited results. Hence, CoCoRes is the primary, followed by maybe Neutral. However, Neutral isn't accurate here. Maybe Basis is not applicable. Therefore, the only accurate class is CoCoRes, but the task requires top three. If forced, perhaps CoCoRes first, then Neutral as second, and Basis third, even if slightly stretching. But given the context, Neutral doesn't fit unless it's just descriptive. Wait, the Neutral example is about spreading magnetic treatment devices, just stating a fact. The given citation is about results differing from another study—this is a direct comparison, CoCoRes. So perhaps the top three are CoCoRes, then maybe Weakness if the difference is a limitation. However, the example states "substantially differ" without indicating weakness. 

Final conclusion: the top three classes are CoCoRes, Neutral, Basis. Wait, no—Neutral and Basis don't fit. Given that, maybe CoCoRes is the only correct one, but since three are needed, perhaps CoCoRes, then maybe CoCoGM as the next (if they compare goals), but the example is about result comparison. Therefore, perhaps the only accurate is CoCoRes, with Neutral and Basis as placeholders, but they may not be correct. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is CoCoRes alone, but the instructions require three. This is tricky. Given the strict example, CoCoRes is first. For the others, maybe CoCoXY if comparing two studies' explanations, but here it's the cited study's results vs the current results. Therefore, the accurate classes are CoCoRes. Since I need three, perhaps the example is CoCoRes, then Neutral (as descriptive mention), then Basis. But Neutral isn't accurate here. Alternatively, maybe the second is CoCoXY, if it's comparing explanations from a cited study and another, but not applicable. Given all, the correct answer is CoCoRes first, followed by Neutral and Basis as the next two. But this is uncertain. Alternatively, maybe Neutral isn't applicable, so the third could be Basis. However, without a clear link to basis, this is a stretch. Given the strict example in CoCoRes matches the given passage exactly, I'll go with CoCoRes first. For secondary classes, perhaps Weakness if the differences indicate a limitation in the cited study, but the passage doesn't indicate criticism. Therefore, Weakness isn't correct. Hence, the final answer should be CoCoRes as first, and maybe Neutral and Basis as second and third even if they're not perfectly fitting. Alternatively, if the citation is purely for CoCoRes, the other two classes might be Basis, CoCoGM, etc., but none apply clearly. Given the constraints of providing three, I'll proceed with CoCoRes as first, Neutral second, and Basis third, acknowledging that Neutral might not be accurate but forced to include.
