Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the given citation. The passage mentions a study where some species were described from China (citation) and then states that their taxonomic status is problematic with some possibly not developing on Pyrus. 

Next, identifying the general intent. The citation here is being used to reference a previous study's classification of 18 species. The key part of the sentence is pointing out that the taxonomic status is problematic and some species might not fit. This suggests the authors are highlighting a weakness or limitation in the cited work. The words "problematic" and "may not develop" indicate criticism of the previous study's conclusions.

Looking at the rhetorical classes, Weakness seems the most appropriate because they're questioning the validity or completeness of the cited research. Then, CoCoXY might come into play if they're comparing the cited study with another, but here there's no mention of another study, just the cited one. It's more about criticizing than comparing explanations or claims between two studies. Support isn't applicable since they aren't supporting their own findings with this citation. CoCoRes is about comparing results directly, but again, the focus here is on pointing out flaws rather than contrasting results. 

The next possible classes could be Neutral if there were no evaluative language, but the terms used are clearly negative regarding the cited work's findings. CoCoGM or Motivation don't fit because they aren't discussing goals, methods, future directions, or motivating their current research with this citation. 

So the order would be Weakness as primary, then maybe CoCoXY if the comparison is between studies, but since there's no second study mentioned, perhaps Neutral or CoCoRes. However, without a direct result comparison, I think Weakness is primary, Neutral for just stating facts, and maybe CoCoXY if there's an implicit comparison between the cited study and others, but given the example, Weakness is clearly first.
