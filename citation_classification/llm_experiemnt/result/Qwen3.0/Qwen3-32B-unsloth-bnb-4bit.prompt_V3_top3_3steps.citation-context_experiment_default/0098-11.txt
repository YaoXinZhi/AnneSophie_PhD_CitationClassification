Okay, let's break this down step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the citation. Let me look at the passage provided.

The sentence with the citation is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." The context here is the present work comparing its results to previous experiments done by the cited authors using different targets.

Next, determining the general intent. Since the sentence is contrasting their results with those from another study, this looks like a Comparative intent. That would fall under the CoCoRes category because they're comparing results directly.

Now, the top rhetorical class here is CoCoRes. Then, what else might apply? The cited study is being contrasted with the current work's findings, so maybe CoCoXY if they're comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies. Wait, but in the example given for CoCoXY, it's comparing two cited studies, not the current work and a cited one. So maybe CoCoRes is the primary. 

Are there any other classes? Neutral wouldn't fit here because it's a direct comparison. Support is when the citation is confirming something. Motivation refers to justifying why the research is done. Future suggests directions for future work. Usage refers to methods. Weakness would be criticizing the cited work. 

In this case, the citation is being used to compare the results of their experiment with the cited study's results. So CoCoRes is the top. Then, maybe CoCoGM or CoCoXY? Wait, CoCoGM is comparing goals or methods. Since the sentence mentions the "results" differing between the present work and the cited work's experiments, it's definitely CoCoRes. 

So top three would be CoCoRes first. Are there other classes? If there's a mention of the methods or goals, like the cited work's methods versus the present ones, but in the given sentence, it's about the results. So maybe CoCoRes is first, then perhaps CoCoXY if they compared two citations, but in this case, they're only comparing their own results with one citation. Neutral might be lower, but Neutral is when it's just descriptive without comparison. So probably the top three are CoCoRes, then maybe Neutral if there's any neutrality, but the comparison is direct. Wait, noâ€”Neutral is when the citation is just stated without any comparison. Here, it's a direct comparison, so CoCoRes is number one. Then maybe CoCoXY if there's another comparison between two studies through the citation, but in the example given, CoCoXY compares two cited studies. Since here the current study is compared to the cited one, it's CoCoRes. So maybe the top three are CoCoRes, then CoCoGM if they mention methods. Wait, the cited study's methods are the deuterium-saturated targets, while the present work's experiments differ. If the comparison is about methods (using TiD, TaD, etc.) then maybe CoCoGM. Wait, the sentence says "results obtained...differ from the results of experiments conducted with...targets". The comparison is between results, so CoCoRes. The experiments with different targets are part of the cited work's methods. So if the authors are contrasting their own methods with those of the cited work, that would be CoCoGM. But the sentence is about the results differing, not the methods. Hmm. So CoCoRes is definitely first. Then maybe Neutral if there's no other significant intent. But perhaps Weakness if they're implying the cited study's results are less valid. However, the sentence doesn't criticize the cited work, just states a difference in results. So Weakness might not apply. Then maybe Neutral as the second class? Or perhaps CoCoGM if the difference in results is due to different methods. Wait, the citation mentions experiments with different targets (TiD, TaD, etc.), so maybe CoCoGM is appropriate for comparing methods. But the focus of the sentence is on the results differing, so CoCoRes is primary. CoCoGM would be secondary if methods are compared. Let me re-read the example for CoCoGM. The example says comparing goals or methods. Here, the present method uses something else versus the cited method using deuterium targets. If the authors are suggesting that their methods differ from the cited work's methods (using different targets), then CoCoGM would be relevant. But the sentence emphasizes the results differing, not the methods. The example for CoCoGM is when the citing paper compares their goals or methods. So if the sentence here is comparing methods (their own vs the cited work's), then CoCoGM. But the sentence mentions "results differ from experiments conducted with...targets," so maybe the methods (targets used) are part of the comparison. If the authors are contrasting their experimental setup (using some targets) with the cited work's setup (using deuterium-saturated targets), then CoCoGM comes into play. That would make CoCoGM a secondary class. Neutral might not fit unless there's neutrality, but here it's a comparison of results and methods. So the top three could be CoCoRes, CoCoGM, Neutral. Because the primary comparison is CoCoRes (results), secondary is CoCoGM (methods), and Neutral if there's any descriptive aspect. However, Neutral is when it's just stated without comparison. Wait, Neutral is when the citation is neutral, like stating facts. In this case, the citation is definitely part of a comparison, so Neutral is probably not the second. Hmm, perhaps after CoCoRes, the next is CoCoXY if there are other studies compared. But the example for CoCoRes says it's a direct comparison between current paper and cited one. So CoCoRes is number one. Maybe the second is something else. Perhaps the sentence is part of a larger section where they compare results, so CoCoRes is primary. The third could be Neutral, but again, that's probably not right. Wait, maybe the authors are pointing out the difference in results to highlight the importance of their findings, which could be part of Motivation or Future. But Motivation is more about why the research was conducted. If the authors are showing that the results differ and pointing out this discrepancy as a basis for further work, it could be Future or Motivation. However, the example given for Future is suggesting directions. The example here is stating a difference, but maybe it's pointing out a contrast to motivate their own research. The sentence says "substantially differ," which might imply that their approach addresses a different aspect, perhaps motivating their own study. So maybe Motivation is also a possible class. 

Putting this together: 

Primary is CoCoRes (direct comparison of results). 

Secondary could be Motivation (the difference in results motivates their research). 

Third might be CoCoGM (if comparing methods, but the sentence doesn't explicitly mention methods, just targets as part of the cited study's setup). Alternatively, maybe CoCoGM is not appropriate if the focus remains on results. 

So perhaps the top three are CoCoRes, Motivation, Neutral. But Neutral might not be right. Alternatively, CoCoRes, then CoCoXY if comparing two cited studies. But CoCoXY is when two cited studies are compared, not the current and one cited. 

Hmm. Given the example of CoCoRes provided closely matches the current sentence: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted..." So CoCoRes is first. Then, maybe CoCoGM if they're contrasting the methods (use of deuterium targets vs their approach). The example given in CoCoGM is contrasting methods. So maybe CoCoGM is second. Then maybe Neutral third? Or maybe Weakness if the cited study's methods are flawed. But the sentence doesn't criticize the cited work, just states differences. 

So tentative top three:

1. CoCoRes

2. CoCoGM

3. Neutral?

Alternatively, could Weakness be involved if the cited study's results are considered less valid because the authors state their results differ substantially, implying the cited study's approach might be limited. But unless there's explicit criticism, Weakness might not apply. 

Given that, I'm stuck between CoCoRes, maybe CoCoGM as secondary, but also Motivation if the difference motivates their study. Wait, the example of Motivation is when previous research identifies a knowledge gap. If the present study addresses this discrepancy, then Motivation applies. But the sentence doesn't explicitly state motivation. 

Wait, the given sentence just states differences in results. Unless the surrounding context motivates their research with this discrepancy. But without seeing more context, it's safer to rely on the given sentence. 

Thus, the top three classes are CoCoRes, maybe CoCoXY if there's a mention of another study's results conflicting. Wait, the example for CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies. Here, it's comparing present work with one cited study's results. So CoCoXY is not applicable. Therefore, only CoCoRes is clear. Then perhaps Neutral as secondary if there's no other comparison. But Neutral is for descriptive citations. Since this is a comparative statement, Neutral is not appropriate. 

Therefore, final answer would be:

1. CoCoRes  
2. CoCoGM  
3. Neutral  

But I'm uncertain about Neutral here. Alternatively, maybe Weakness if the cited study's results are problematic. However, without explicit criticism, Weakness doesn't fit. 

Alternatively, maybe only CoCoRes is primary, and the others might be Motivation but I'm not sure. Given the example provided for CoCoRes matches closely, I'll go with CoCoRes as first. Then perhaps CoCoGM if methods are compared. So the final ranking would be CoCoRes first, CoCoGM second, Neutral third.
