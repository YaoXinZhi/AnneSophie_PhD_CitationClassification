Okay, let's start by looking at the citation passage provided. The task is to determine the top three rhetorical classes for the citation marked @@CITATION@@. 

First, I need to extract the context around that citation. Suppose the passage mentions something like, "The effectiveness of the new pesticide formulation was compared with traditional methods, as demonstrated by @@CITATION@@ who found a significant reduction in pest population using older techniques."

In Step 1, the relevant context would be the sentence discussing the comparison with traditional methods and the reference to significant reduction. 

Next, Step 2 involves identifying the general intent. Since the citation is used to show a comparison between the new pesticide's effectiveness and traditional methods, this leans towards Comparative. Specifically, it's comparing results or findings between the cited work and the citing paper, which falls under CoCoRes. However, if the comparison is between the methods or goals of the cited work and the current study, it might be CoCoGM instead. I need to check the example definitions carefully.

In the example given for CoCoRes, the citation directly contrasts results. If the passage's context is similar, CoCoRes would be appropriate. If it's comparing how the results differ, then CoCoRes is correct. Alternatively, if two studies are compared to each other without involving the citing paper, CoCoXY might come into play. 

For Step 3, ranking the top three classes. Assuming the context involves a direct comparison of findings between the cited work and the current study, the primary class would be CoCoRes. If there's also a mention of different methods, maybe CoCoGM. If the cited work's results support the current work's argument, Support might be a secondary class. Neutral might be lower if there's clear comparison happening.

Putting it all together, after analyzing the context and intent, the top three classes would likely be CoCoRes, followed by CoCoGM or Support, and then Neutral or CoCoXY depending on specifics not clearly stated here. However, without the exact passage text, this analysis is hypothetical. Once the actual passage is known, these steps would be applied accordingly.
