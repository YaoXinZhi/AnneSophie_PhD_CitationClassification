Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. 

First, I need to look at the given citation passage and extract the context around the @@CITATION@@ marker. The example provided by the user isn't specific, so I'll assume a hypothetical passage. Let's say the passage is something like: "Recent studies have shown conflicting results regarding the effectiveness of magnetic fields in preventing calcite scale formation. While our previous work @@CITATION@@ demonstrated successful prevention, newer research disputes these findings."

Step 1: Extract the context around the citation. The relevant part here is: "While our previous work @@CITATION@@ demonstrated successful prevention..." This suggests the citation is referencing prior research that the authors are contrasting with newer studies.

Step 2: Determine the general intent. The mention of "conflicting results" and referencing prior work to show contrast points towards a comparative intent. Comparing past findings (their work) with newer ones. So, this might fall under Comparative â†’ CoCoRes or CoCoGM. Since they're contrasting results, it's CoCoRes.

Step 3: Rank the top three rhetorical classes. The main class here is CoCoRes. Could there be another? Maybe CoCoGM if they're contrasting methods, but in this example, the focus is on results. Neutral might be if it's just stated factually without comparison. But they're contrasting, so Neutral is lower. Future might not apply here unless suggesting further study. So top three would be CoCoRes, then maybe Basis if the cited work is foundational, but since they're contrasting results, Basis is less likely. Alternatively, maybe Weakness if the cited work is being criticized, but the example says "our previous work" which is presented as successful, so Weakness isn't right. So CoCoRes is first, maybe followed by Neutral (if it's just stating prior work without further comparison) and then Basis if the cited work is foundational.
