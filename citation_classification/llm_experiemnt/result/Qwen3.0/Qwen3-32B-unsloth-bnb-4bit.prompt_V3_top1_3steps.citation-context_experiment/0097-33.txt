Okay, let me tackle this step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage is talking about a study on the effects of a new pesticide on plant health. The citation is mentioned in the sentence: "The efficacy of the pesticide was evaluated using a controlled field trial design, as described by @@CITATION@@." 

So, the key part here is that they're referring to a method used in a previous study. The authors are saying they used a design that was previously described by someone else. 

Next, I need to figure out the general intent. Since they're mentioning the method they used was described in another paper, this seems like they're citing the source of their methodology. That would fall under technical usage because they're directly using a method from the cited work.

Looking at the rhetorical classes, the "Usage" class is for when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup used in the current study. The example given in the prompt is about an experimental setup described previously, which matches this case. The authors here are using the controlled field trial design from the cited paper, so the correct class should be Usage.
