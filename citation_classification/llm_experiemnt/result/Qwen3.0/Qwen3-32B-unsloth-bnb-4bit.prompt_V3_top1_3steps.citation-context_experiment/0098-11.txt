Okay, let's tackle this citation classification step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the @@CITATION@@. The passage says, "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." So the key part here is that the setup was described in a prior work.

Next, determining the general intent. The phrase "described in detail previously" suggests that the cited work is the source of the experimental setup used in the current study. This points towards the Usage class because the citation is referencing a method or setup that's being directly used here.

Looking at the definitions, Usage is when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup from the cited work that is directly used in the current study. The example given is very similar: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@" which matches the example provided for Usage. There's no indication of comparison, support, or criticism here. The authors are just stating that they used a previously described setup. So the most appropriate label here is Usage.
