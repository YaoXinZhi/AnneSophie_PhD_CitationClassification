Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. The task is to determine the rhetorical class of the citation in the given passage. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@."

Looking at the context, the key phrase is "substantially differ from the results of..." This indicates that the authors are comparing their findings with those from the cited work. The comparison here is about the results themselves, not the methods or goals. The example provided under CoCoRes mentions a direct comparison of results, which aligns with this scenario. 

Next, identifying the general intent. Since the citation is used to highlight differences in results, it falls under the Comparative category. Specifically, CoCoRes is for comparing results or findings. The example given in the instructions for CoCoRes is almost identical to this case, where the present work's results are contrasted with those from the cited study.

Now, selecting the specific rhetorical class. The options under Comparative are CoCoGM, CoCoRes, and CoCoXY. Since the comparison here is about the results (not goals/methods or explanations between studies), CoCoRes is the correct choice. There's no mention of contrasting explanations or claims between two cited studies, nor is it about goals or methods. The focus is purely on the results obtained.

Therefore, the most appropriate label here is CoCoRes.
