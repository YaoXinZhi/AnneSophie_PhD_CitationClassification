Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. First, I need to look at the context around the citation in the given passage. The passage mentions that the authors used a specific method introduced by @@CITATION@@ to analyze their data. The key phrase here is "using the method described by @@CITATION@@".

Next, I should identify the general intent. The citation here is referring to a method that the current study is using. According to the definitions provided, when a citation is used to reference a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup that's directly used in the current study, it falls under the "Usage" category. 

Looking at the examples given for "Usage", one example is about an experimental set-up described previously. The current case is similar because the method from the cited work is directly applied here. There's no indication of comparison, support, or criticism, just a direct use of the method. 

So, the most appropriate rhetorical class here is "Usage".
