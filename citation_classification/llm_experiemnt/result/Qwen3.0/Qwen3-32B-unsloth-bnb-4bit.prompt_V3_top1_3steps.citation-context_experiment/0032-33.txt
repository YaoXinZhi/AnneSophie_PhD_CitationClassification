Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. The task is to determine the rhetorical class of the citation in the given passage. 

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage says, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." 

Looking at the context, the key phrase here is "substantially differ from the results of..." which indicates that the authors are comparing their results with those from the cited work. The citation is being used to highlight a direct comparison between their findings and the previous study's results.

Next, I need to identify the general intent. Since the citation is used to contrast results, this falls under the "Comparative" category. Now, looking at the specific rhetorical classes under Comparative: CoCoRes is for comparing results, which matches this scenario. The example provided for CoCoRes also involves a comparison of results between the current work and the cited paper. 

Therefore, the correct label here should be CoCoRes.
