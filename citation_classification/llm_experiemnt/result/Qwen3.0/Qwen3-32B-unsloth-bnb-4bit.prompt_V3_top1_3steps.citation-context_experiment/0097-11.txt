Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage says, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." 

So the key part here is comparing their results with those from a previous study. The phrase "substantially differ" indicates a direct comparison of findings. Looking at the definitions, CoCoRes is for comparing results or findings between the cited work and the current paper. 

Next, checking the example given for CoCoRes: it's about differing results from an experiment, which matches the context here. There's no mention of methods or goals, so CoCoGM isn't it. Also, it's not a comparison between two other studies, so CoCoXY is out. The intent is to highlight differing results, so CoCoRes is the correct class.
