Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage is: "The application of biological control agents (BCAs) has gained significant attention as an eco-friendly alternative to chemical pesticides in managing plant diseases. @@CITATION@@ demonstrated the efficacy of Trichoderma spp. in suppressing soil-borne pathogens through the production of antifungal metabolites."

So the citation is used to show that Trichoderma spp. were shown to be effective by the cited work. The next step is to determine the intent. The sentence is stating that the cited work demonstrated efficacy, which supports the current discussion about BCAs being effective. This seems like the citation is providing support for the claim made in the current paper. 

Looking at the options, Support is when the citation is used to support or confirm the work, results, or findings. The example given for Support mentions that the subscales were consistent with previous research, which aligns with this case. The cited work here is confirming the efficacy of Trichoderma, supporting the current discussion on BCAs. 

So the rhetorical class should be Support.
