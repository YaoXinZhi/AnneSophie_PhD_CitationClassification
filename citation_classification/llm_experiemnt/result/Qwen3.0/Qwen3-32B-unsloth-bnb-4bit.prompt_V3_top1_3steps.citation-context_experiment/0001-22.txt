Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. First, I need to look at the citation in the given passage. The passage says, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." 

So, the context here is comparing the results of the current study with those from the cited work. The key phrase is "substantially differ," which indicates a direct comparison of findings. According to the definitions provided, CoCoRes is used when the citation is comparing results or findings between the cited work and the citing paper. 

Looking at the example for CoCoRes, it's similar: comparing results obtained in the present work with those from experiments mentioned in the citation. The example given in the instructions uses "substantially differ," just like in the current case. 

The general intent here is to highlight differences in results, which falls under Comparative â†’ CoCoRes. There's no mention of goals or methods, so CoCoGM isn't applicable. It's not a comparison between two cited studies either, so CoCoXY is out. The citation isn't supporting, motivating, or criticizing, so those categories don't fit. Therefore, the correct class should be CoCoRes.
