Okay, let's start by looking at the given passage. The user has provided a scientific article citation passage where I need to classify the rhetorical role of the citation marked as @@CITATION@@.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The sentence is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@."

The key part here is that the authors are comparing their results ("present work") with those from previous experiments using specific deuterium saturated metal targets cited by @@CITATION@@. They mention that their results "substantially differ," which indicates a direct comparison of findings between the two studies.

Next, I need to determine the general intent. The sentence is contrasting the results of the current study with those cited. This falls under the comparative category, specifically comparing results. Looking at the predefined classes, CoCoRes is for comparing results of cited work with the citing paper's results. 

The example given for CoCoRes matches this scenario where results are directly compared. The cited work's results are being contrasted with the present work's findings, hence fitting the CoCoRes classification.
