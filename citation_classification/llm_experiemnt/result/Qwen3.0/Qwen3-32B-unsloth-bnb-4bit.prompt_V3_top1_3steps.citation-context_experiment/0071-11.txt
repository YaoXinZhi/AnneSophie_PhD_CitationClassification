Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. The user provided a citation passage and wants me to assign the correct rhetorical class from the given list.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage is about a study on the distribution of a virus in plants, citing a previous study by @@CITATION@@. The sentence mentions that conflicting results were described for a phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima compared to other studies. 

Next, determine the general intent. The citation is used to compare conflicting results between two studies (the cited one and another mentioned). The example given for CoCoXY involves comparing two cited studies with each other, not the current paper. Here, the authors are pointing out conflicting findings between the cited work and another study, which aligns with CoCoXY's definition of comparing explanations or claims between cited works.

So the specific class here should be CoCoXY because it's contrasting results between two cited studies.
