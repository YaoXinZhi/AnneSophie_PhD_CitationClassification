Okay, let's start by looking at the passage provided. The citation is mentioned here: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The key part is comparing the results of the current work with those from a previous study using different metal targets. The phrase "substantially differ" indicates a direct comparison of findings between the two studies.

Next, determining the general intent. Since the authors are contrasting their results with those cited, this falls under the Comparative category. Now, looking at the specific rhetorical classes under Comparative: CoCoRes is for comparing results or findings. The example given for CoCoRes mentions differing results from cited experiments, which matches the context here. 

The citation isn't about goals or methods (CoCoGM) or explanations between studies (CoCoXY). It's a direct result comparison. Therefore, the correct class should be CoCoRes.
