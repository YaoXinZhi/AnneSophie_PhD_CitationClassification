Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. The passage provided is:

"@@CITATION@@ demonstrated the effectiveness of a new method for detecting plant pathogens using RNA sequencing. This approach was later adopted by several other studies to improve diagnostic accuracy."

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The key part here is that the cited work demonstrated a new method's effectiveness, and subsequent studies adopted it. 

Next, identifying the general intent. The citation is being used to show that the method was proven effective and then used by others. This seems like it's supporting the current work by referencing a validated method that others have built upon. 

Looking at the options, "Support" would fit because the citation is confirming the effectiveness and adoption of the method. The authors are likely using this citation to back up their own use or discussion of the method. There's no comparison here, no criticism, just support for the method's validity through prior research. 

So the specific rhetorical class should be Support.
