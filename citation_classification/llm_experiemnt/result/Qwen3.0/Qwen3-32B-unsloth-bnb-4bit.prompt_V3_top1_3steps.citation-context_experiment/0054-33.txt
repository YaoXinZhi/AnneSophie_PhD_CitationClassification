Okay, let's tackle this citation classification step by step. The user provided a scientific passage with a citation marked as @@CITATION@@. My job is to figure out which rhetorical class it belongs to from the given list.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage is: "The presence of Phytoplasma in the phloem of infected plants has been confirmed by several studies @@CITATION@@." So the citation here is supporting the statement that multiple studies have confirmed Phytoplasma in phloem. 

Next, identifying the general intent. The author is citing previous works to back up their claim that the presence has been confirmed. That sounds like a supportive intent because they're using existing research to validate their own assertion. 

Now, looking at the specific rhetorical classes under Supportive, which includes 'Support' and 'Similar'. The example for 'Support' mentions that the citation supports or confirms the work of the citing authors. Here, the citation is used to show that other studies have already confirmed this, which supports the current statement. The 'Similar' class would be if they're pointing out similarities between the cited work and their own, but in this case, it's more about confirmation rather than similarity. 

So the most appropriate class here is 'Support'.
