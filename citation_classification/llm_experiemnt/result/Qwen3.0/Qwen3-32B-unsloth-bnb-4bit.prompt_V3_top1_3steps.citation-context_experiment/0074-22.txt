Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. The user provided a passage with a citation that needs to be classified into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage is: "The occurrence of 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' in daisy plants has been widely documented. Fast multiplication rates and high concentration of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains have been reported in young developing leaves and roots of infected daisy plants (Wei et al., 2004; Saracco et al., 2006), although conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima @@CITATION@@." 

The citation here is referring to conflicting results in another study involving Euphorbia pulcherrima. The key part is "conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima @@CITATION@@".

Next, identifying the general intent. The author is pointing out that there are conflicting results in the cited work compared to previous findings. The mention of conflicting results suggests a comparison between studies, specifically contrasting their findings. 

Looking at the rhetorical classes, CoCoRes is for comparing results, while CoCoXY is for comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies. Here, the citation is contrasting results between the cited work and the previous studies mentioned (Wei et al., 2004; Saracco et al., 2006). However, the example for CoCoXY mentions conflicting results between two cited studies, not between the citing paper and a cited one. But in this case, the conflict is between the cited study (the one at the citation) and the previous ones. Wait, the example for CoCoXY is when two cited studies are compared with each other, not with the current paper. The example given is: "Fast multiplication rates... although conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima @@CITATION@@".

In this case, the cited work (the one at the citation) is being compared with previous studies (Wei and Saracco) in terms of their results. So this is a comparison of results between the cited work and others, which fits CoCoRes. However, the example in CoCoRes is when the citing paper's results are compared with the cited work's. But here, the conflict is between the cited work and previous studies, not the current paper's results. Wait, the example for CoCoRes is when the current paper's results are compared with the cited work's. In the user's example, the current paper isn't presenting results but is pointing out conflicting results between previous studies and the cited work. Hmm, maybe this is a case of CoCoXY where two cited studies are compared. Wait, the example for CoCoXY says "compare or contrast two cited studies with each other â€” not with the citing paper." In the user's case, the citation is part of a list where conflicting results are described between the cited study (the one at @@CITATION@@) and previous ones (Wei and Saracco). So the current paper is contrasting the results of the cited study with those of Wei and Saracco. But since the current paper isn't presenting its own results, but just noting the conflict between the two cited studies, this would be CoCoXY. 

Wait, the example for CoCoXY is when two cited studies are compared. In the user's case, the citation is one of the studies being compared with others (Wei and Saracco). So the current paper is pointing out conflicting results between the cited study (at @@CITATION@@) and the previous ones. That's a comparison of results between the cited work and others, but since the current paper isn't presenting its own results, it's more about contrasting two cited works. Therefore, this fits CoCoXY, which is comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies. The example given in CoCoXY mentions conflicting results between two studies. So the correct class here is CoCoXY.
