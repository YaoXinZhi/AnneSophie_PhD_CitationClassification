Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. The user provided a scientific passage with a citation marked as @@CITATION@@. My job is to determine the correct rhetorical class from the given list.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." 

Looking at this, the key part is "substantially differ from the results... @@CITATION@@".

Next, identify the general intent. The author is comparing their results with those from the cited study. The focus is on the difference in results between the current work and the previous experiments mentioned. 

Comparing results directly points towards the CoCoRes category, which is defined as comparing or contrasting results or findings of the cited work with the citing paper. The example given in the guidelines matches this scenario exactly, where the results are stated to differ substantially.

Now, checking if there's any other possible category. It's not a comparison of methods or goals (CoCoGM), nor is it a comparison between two other studies (CoCoXY). There's no support, motivation, or weakness mentioned here. The intent is purely to highlight differing results. 

Therefore, the correct rhetorical class here is CoCoRes.
