Okay, let's tackle this classification problem step by step. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The given passage is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." The citation here is directly following a statement about differing results. 

Next, I need to determine the general intent. The phrase "substantially differ from the results of..." indicates a direct comparison between the current study's results and those from the cited work. According to the definitions, this falls under Comparative intent, specifically a comparison of results.

Now, looking at the fine-grained classes, CoCoRes is the category for comparing or contrasting results or findings. The example provided in the prompt matches this scenario exactly, where the current work's results are contrasted with those from the cited paper. There's no mention of methods, goals, or explanations here, so CoCoGM or CoCoXY are out. The citation isn't supporting, motivating, or criticizing the current work, so Support, Motivation, or Weakness don't fit. Therefore, the correct class here is CoCoRes.
