Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. 

First, I need to look at the context around the citation. The passage says, "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." The key part here is "described in detail previously," which indicates that the cited work is where the setup was originally detailed.

Next, I should determine the general intent. The phrase "was described in detail previously" suggests that the current study is referencing a prior paper for the method or setup they're using. This points towards the citation being used to indicate that the method is not new here but was established in the cited work. 

Looking at the categories, the "Usage" class is defined as when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup from the cited work that is directly used in the current study. The example given is very similar: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." 

So, the context here matches the "Usage" class because the citation is pointing to where the experimental setup was originally described, which the current study is using. There's no comparison, support, motivation, or criticism hereâ€”just a direct reference to the method's origin. Therefore, the correct label should be "Usage."
