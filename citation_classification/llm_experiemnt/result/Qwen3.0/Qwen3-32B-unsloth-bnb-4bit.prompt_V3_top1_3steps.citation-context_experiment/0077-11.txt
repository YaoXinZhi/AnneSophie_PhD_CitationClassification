Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. The task is to determine the rhetorical class of the citation marked @@CITATION@@ in the given passage.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage provided is:

`The use of biological control agents (BCAs) has been increasingly recognized as an effective strategy for managing plant diseases caused by phytopathogens @@CITATION@@.`

The citation here is part of a statement that introduces the use of BCAs as an effective strategy. The phrase "has been increasingly recognized" suggests that existing research supports this view. The author is referencing prior work that has established the effectiveness of BCAs in managing plant diseases.

Next, I need to identify the general intent. The citation is used to back up the claim that BCAs are effective. This seems like a supportive citation because the author is relying on previous studies to validate their assertion. The example given under the 'Support' class mentions a citation used to confirm findings, which aligns with this scenario.

Looking at the options, 'Support' is for when the citation supports or confirms the work of the citing authors. The passage doesn't compare methods, results, or goals, nor does it criticize or point out weaknesses. It's straightforwardly referencing prior research to support the current statement. There's no indication of a comparison with other studies or the current paper's own methods/results. Therefore, the most appropriate class here is 'Support'.
