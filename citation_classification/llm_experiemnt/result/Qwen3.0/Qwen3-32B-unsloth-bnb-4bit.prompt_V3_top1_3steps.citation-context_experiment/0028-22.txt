Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage is talking about a study that used a specific method to detect phytoplasma strains in daisy plants and roots, citing Wei et al., 2004 and Saracco et al., 2006. Then it mentions conflicting results in another study on Euphorbia pulcherrima with the citation here.

So the context is comparing two studies. The first part says that certain strains were reported in young leaves and roots, but then there's conflicting results in another case. The citation is pointing out that there's a conflict between the cited study and another one. The example given for CoCoXY mentions comparing two cited studies with each other, not the current paper. 

The intent here seems to highlight conflicting results between two previous studies. The current paper isn't directly comparing its own results but is pointing out a discrepancy between two existing studies. That fits the CoCoXY category because it's contrasting explanations or claims from different sources. The example provided in the definitions for CoCoXY is about conflicting results between two cited works, which matches this scenario. So the rhetorical class should be CoCoXY.
