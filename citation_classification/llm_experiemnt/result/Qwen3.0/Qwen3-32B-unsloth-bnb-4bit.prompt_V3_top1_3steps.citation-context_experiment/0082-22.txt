Okay, let me try to work through this step by step. The user provided a citation passage and wants me to classify the rhetorical role of the citation. The possible classes are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Motivation, Future, Support, Similar, Usage, Weakness, or Neutral.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The example given in the instructions is a passage where the citation is used to compare conflicting results between two studies. The example mentions "conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima @@CITATION@@" and the class is CoCoXY because it's comparing explanations or claims between studies.

Now, looking at the user's specific input passage: "Fast multiplication rates and high concentration of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains have been reported in young developing leaves and roots of infected daisy plants (Wei et al., 2004; Saracco et al., 2006), although conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima @@CITATION@." 

The key part here is "conflicting results were described..." followed by the citation. This suggests that the citation is being used to present conflicting findings between studies. According to the definitions, CoCoXY is when the citation compares two cited studies with each other, not with the current paper. The example given for CoCoXY also involves conflicting results between two studies. 

So the intent here is to contrast the results of different studies (the ones by Wei et al. and Saracco et al. with the cited work). The citation here is pointing out conflicting results between the cited study and others. Therefore, the rhetorical class should be CoCoXY.
