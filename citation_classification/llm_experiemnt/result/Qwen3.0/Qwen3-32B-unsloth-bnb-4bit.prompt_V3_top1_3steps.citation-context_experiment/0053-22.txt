Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. The user provided a passage with a citation marked as @@CITATION@@. My job is to determine the rhetorical class of that citation from the given list.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. Let's look at the passage:

"In the present study, the effectiveness of a new fungicide was evaluated against powdery mildew in grapevines. The results showed a significant reduction in disease severity compared to untreated controls. A similar outcome was reported by @@CITATION@@, who tested the same fungicide on wheat."

So, the context is about a study's results on a fungicide's effectiveness against powdery mildew in grapevines. The authors mention that a similar outcome was reported by the cited work, which tested the same fungicide on wheat.

Next, identifying the general intent. The key phrase here is "similar outcome," which suggests that the citation is being used to point out a similarity between their study and the cited work. The cited study tested the same fungicide on wheat, and the current study on grapevines both found positive results. The intent here seems to be to highlight that their findings align with previous results in a similar context.

Looking at the predefined categories, the 'Similar' class is for when the citation points out a similarity between the cited work and the citing paper, concerning results, patterns, etc. The example given for 'Similar' mentions findings related to insect-associated bacteria, which is analogous to this case where the fungicide's effectiveness is similar in different crops.

Comparing with other categories: 'Support' is about confirming the citing authors' work, but here it's about similarity between the two studies. 'CoCoRes' is for comparing results with the citing paper, but here the comparison is between the cited work and the current study's results. 'CoCoXY' is for comparing two cited studies, which isn't the case here. 'Motivation' would be if the citation is used to justify the current research, which isn't happening here. 'Neutral' is for descriptive use without argument, but here there's a clear similarity being pointed out.

Therefore, the most appropriate class is 'Similar'.
