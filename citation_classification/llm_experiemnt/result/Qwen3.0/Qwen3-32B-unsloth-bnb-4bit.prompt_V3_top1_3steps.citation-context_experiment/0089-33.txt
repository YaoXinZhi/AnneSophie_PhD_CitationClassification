Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. The task is to determine the rhetorical class of the citation in the given passage. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage says: "However, the application of these techniques in plant health diagnostics remains limited due to challenges in scalability and specificity. For instance, @@CITATION@@ demonstrated that traditional methods often fail to detect low concentrations of pathogens in complex samples."

So the context is about the challenges in applying certain techniques in plant health diagnostics, specifically mentioning that traditional methods have issues with detecting low pathogen concentrations. The citation here is used to provide an example of a study that showed traditional methods' shortcomings.

Next, identify the general intent. The citation is used to support the claim that traditional methods are not effective in certain scenarios. The author is citing this work to back up their statement about the limitations, which suggests a supportive intent. 

Looking at the options, Support is when the citation is used to support or confirm the authors' work. The example given in the Support class mentions that the subscales were consistent with previous research, which aligns with how the citation here is used to support the claim about traditional methods' failures. 

The other possibilities like CoCoRes or Weakness don't fit because there's no direct comparison of results between the cited work and the current study, nor is there a criticism of the cited work. It's more about using the cited study's findings to support the current argument about limitations. 

Therefore, the correct class should be Support.
