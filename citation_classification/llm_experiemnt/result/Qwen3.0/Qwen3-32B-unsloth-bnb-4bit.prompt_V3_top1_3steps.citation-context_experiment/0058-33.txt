Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. The user provided a citation passage and wants me to assign the correct rhetorical class from the given list. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage is: "The effectiveness of the proposed method was validated through experiments comparing it with existing approaches, as detailed in @@CITATION@@." The key part here is that the citation is mentioned in the context of experiments that validated the method by comparing it with existing approaches.

Next, I identify the general intent. The citation here is used to reference where the comparison experiments were detailed. The citing paper is discussing their validation through experiments, and they're pointing to the cited work as where these comparisons are elaborated. This seems like a comparison of results because they're contrasting their method's effectiveness with existing ones as described in the cited paper.

Looking at the specific classes, CoCoRes is for comparing results or findings. The example given for CoCoRes involves direct comparison of results between the current work and the cited one. In this case, the citation is where the experiments (and thus the results) are detailed, so it fits CoCoRes. It's not CoCoGM because it's not about goals or methods, nor CoCoXY which is about explanations or claims between two studies. The intent here is to compare the results of their method with existing approaches as detailed in the cited work, so CoCoRes is the right label.
