Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. The user provided a scientific passage with a citation, and I need to determine its rhetorical class from the given list. 

First, I'll look at the context around the citation. The passage says: "The effectiveness of the proposed method was validated through experiments on a set of plant disease datasets, demonstrating higher accuracy compared to traditional approaches (Smith et al., 2020) @@CITATION@@." 

So, the citation here is being used to compare the results of the current study with those of Smith et al. The key part is "demonstrating higher accuracy compared to traditional approaches (Smith et al., 2020)." The authors are showing that their method is better than previous ones. 

Next, I need to figure out the general intent. The options are Foundational, Comparative, Motivational, Supportive, Technical, Critical/Analytical, or Descriptive. Here, the citation is comparing results, which falls under Comparative. 

Now, within Comparative, there are three subclasses: CoCoGM (Goals/Methods), CoCoRes (Results), and CoCoXY (Explanations/Claims). Since the comparison is about the accuracy results (results of the experiments), this fits CoCoRes. 

I should double-check if there's a possibility of another class. For example, if they were comparing methods, it would be CoCoGM. But the sentence specifically mentions "higher accuracy," which is a result. Also, CoCoXY involves comparing explanations between two cited studies, which isn't the case here. 

Therefore, the correct class is CoCoRes.
