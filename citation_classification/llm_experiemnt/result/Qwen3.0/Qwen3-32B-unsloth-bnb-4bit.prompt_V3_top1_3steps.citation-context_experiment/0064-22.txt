Okay, let's tackle this classification problem step by step. First, I need to look at the citation passage provided. The user mentioned that the citation is tagged as @@CITATION@@ within the passage. 

The passage is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@."

In Step 1, I need to extract the context around the citation. The key part here is that the authors are stating their results differ "substantially" from those obtained in experiments using specific deuterium-saturated metal targets, which are cited. The context is about comparing their results with those of the cited work.

Moving to Step 2, the general intent here is comparative. They are contrasting their findings with the cited study's results. According to the guidelines, when the citation is used to compare results directly, it falls under CoCoRes. The example given for CoCoRes mentions comparing results of experiments, which aligns with this case.

In Step 3, selecting the specific class. Since the authors are directly contrasting their results with those cited, the appropriate label is CoCoRes. There's no mention of goals or methods, just the results themselves. Also, it's not a comparison between two cited studies as in CoCoXY. Therefore, CoCoRes is the correct choice.
