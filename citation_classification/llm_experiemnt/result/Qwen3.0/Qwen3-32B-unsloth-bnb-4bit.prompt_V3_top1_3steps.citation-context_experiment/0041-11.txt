Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to classify the citation in the given passage. First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage is: "The presence of phytoplasma in the phloem tissue of infected plants has been confirmed through multiple studies. For instance, @@CITATION@@ reported the detection of phytoplasma in the phloem of daisy plants, while another study @@CITATION@@ found similar results in grapevines."

So the first step is to look at the sentence where the first citation is. The context here is that the authors are citing a study which reported phytoplasma in daisy phloem. The next citation talks about grapevines. The first citation's context is providing an example of a study that confirmed the presence in daisies.

Next, I need to determine the intent. The authors are using this citation to support their statement that multiple studies have confirmed phytoplasma in phloem. They're giving an example of such a study. The intent here seems supportiveâ€”they're backing up their claim with previous research.

Looking at the options, Support is when the citation is used to support or confirm the citing authors' work. The example given in the instructions shows that Support is for confirming results. Here, the citation is an example supporting the general statement about multiple studies. So the rhetorical class should be Support.
