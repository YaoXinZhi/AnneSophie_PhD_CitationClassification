Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. The citation is in the sentence: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The key part here is that the current work's results are being compared to those from another study using specific metal targets. The phrase "substantially differ" indicates a direct comparison of results.

Next, identifying the general intent. Since the authors are contrasting their findings with those of the cited work, this falls under Comparative intent. The specific type of comparison here is about the results themselves, not methods or goals. 

Looking at the rhetorical classes, CoCoRes is for comparing results. The example given in the guidelines matches this scenario where results are directly compared. There's no mention of methods or goals here, so CoCoGM isn't applicable. The cited work's results are being contrasted with the current study's, so CoCoRes is the right choice.
