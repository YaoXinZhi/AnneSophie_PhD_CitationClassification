Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. First, I need to look at the citation passage provided and extract the context around the @@CITATION@@ tag. The passage is:

"Our previous research @@CITATION@@ has shown that the formation of the hard calcite scale on the surfaces exposed to hard water can be successfully prevented with the applied magnetic field. The explanation of the phenomena is not yet offered and the purpose of this work is to try to understand the mechanism of the beneficial influence of the magnetic treatment."

So, the context here is that the authors are referring to their own previous research. The key part is "Our previous research @@CITATION@@ has shown..." which indicates that they are building upon their prior work. The next sentence explains that while they found a method effective, the underlying explanation is still lacking, which is why the current study is being conducted.

Moving to Step 2, identifying the general intent. The citation is used to justify why the current research is being done. The previous research showed a result (magnetic fields prevent calcite scale), but there's a gap in understanding the mechanism. This fits under the "Motivational" category because it's about identifying a knowledge gap that motivates the current study.

Now, Step 3 is to select the specific rhetorical class. Looking at the options under Motivation, the example given is similar: the citation shows prior work that indicates a need for further research. The example mentions that previous research showed a phenomenon but didn't explain it, hence motivating the current work. This matches the provided passage exactly. Therefore, the correct class here is "Motivation".
