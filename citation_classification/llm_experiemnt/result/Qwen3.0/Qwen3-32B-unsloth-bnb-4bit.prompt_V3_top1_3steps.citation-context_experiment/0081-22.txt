Okay, let's tackle this classification task step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage provided is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@."

Step 1: Extracting the context. The key part here is that the current work's results are stated to "substantially differ" from those of the cited experiments. The citation is directly mentioned in relation to the results of experiments using specific deuterium-saturated metal targets.

Step 2: Identifying the general intent. The phrase "substantially differ from the results" indicates a direct comparison of findings between the current study and the cited work. According to the guidelines, when the citation is used to compare or contrast results, it falls under the Comparative category. The specific sub-class for comparing results is CoCoRes.

Step 3: Selecting the specific rhetorical class. Since the example given for CoCoRes involves comparing results, and the passage here does exactly that by stating differences in results, the correct label here should be CoCoRes.
