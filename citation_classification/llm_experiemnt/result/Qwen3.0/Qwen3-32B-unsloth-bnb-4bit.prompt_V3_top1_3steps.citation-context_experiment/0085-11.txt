Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in the given passage. First, I'll extract the context around the @@CITATION@@. The passage says: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." 

So the context is about the experimental setup being described in a previous study. The key here is that the current paper is referring to a prior work where the setup was detailed. The authors are indicating that they used an existing method or setup from another study.

Next, I need to determine the general intent. The phrase "was described in detail previously" suggests that they are citing a source for the methodology they used. This looks like they're using the cited work's setup as a basis for their own experiment. 

Looking at the categories, "Usage" is for when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup from the cited work that is directly used. The example given for Usage is exactly this kind of scenario where the setup is referenced from a previous study. 

So the specific rhetorical class here should be "Usage" because the citation is pointing to where the experimental setup was originally described, which the current study is using.
