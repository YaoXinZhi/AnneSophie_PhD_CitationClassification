Okay, let's start by looking at the passage provided. The user wants me to classify the rhetorical class of the citation tagged @@CITATION@@.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage says: "The presence of the pathogen was confirmed by PCR analysis as previously described @@CITATION@@." 

Now, looking at the context, the authors are mentioning that they used PCR analysis to confirm the pathogen's presence, and they reference a previous description of this method. The key here is that the citation is pointing to where the method was previously described. 

Next, I need to determine the general intent. Since the citation is referring to a method that's been used before and is being applied here, it's about supporting their current work with a previously established method. According to the definitions, "Support" is when the citation is used to support or confirm the work, result, or finding of the citing authors. 

The example given for "Support" mentions that the subscales were consistent with previous research, which aligns with using a prior method to back up their current PCR analysis. The citation isn't comparing methods, results, or goals, nor is it motivating future work or pointing out weaknesses. It's directly supporting their methodology by referencing a prior description. 

Therefore, the correct rhetorical class here is "Support".
