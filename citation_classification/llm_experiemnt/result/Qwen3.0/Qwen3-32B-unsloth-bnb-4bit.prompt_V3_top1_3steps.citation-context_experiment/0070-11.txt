Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. 

First, I need to look at the context around the citation. The passage says, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." 

So, the key part here is "substantially differ from the results of..." which indicates a direct comparison between the current study's results and those cited. According to the step-by-step instructions, if the citation is comparing results, the rhetorical class would be CoCoRes. 

Looking at the examples provided for CoCoRes, the example given is very similar: comparing results obtained in the present work with those from a cited study. The example's structure matches the current case. 

The general intent here is comparative, specifically focusing on results. There's no mention of methods, goals, or explanations, so CoCoGM or CoCoXY don't fit. It's not supporting or motivating, so Support or Motivation are out. The citation isn't being used to point out weaknesses or for future directions either. Therefore, the most accurate classification here is CoCoRes.
