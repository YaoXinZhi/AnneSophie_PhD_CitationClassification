Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. The citation is in the sentence: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The key part here is that the current work's results are compared as "substantially differ" from those in the cited experiments. The mention is specifically about the results of the experiments using deuterium-saturated targets.

Next, identifying the general intent. The sentence is contrasting the results of the current study with those from the cited work. According to the guidelines, comparing results falls under the Comparative category. Now, looking at the fine-grained classes under Comparative, CoCoRes is for direct comparison of results or findings. 

The example given for CoCoRes is similar: "The results obtained... differ from... @@CITATION@@" which matches the structure here. There's a direct comparison between the present results and the cited ones. 

So the specific rhetorical class here should be CoCoRes.
