Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. First, I need to look at the passage where the citation is placed. The user provided the context around the @@CITATION@@ tag.

The passage says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@."

So the key part here is "substantially differ from the results of the experiments..." which indicates that the authors are comparing their results with those from the cited work. The example given for CoCoRes mentions comparing results directly. 

In the example, they talk about differing results and reference the citation. The user's passage also mentions substantial differences, which aligns with CoCoRes. The intent here is to contrast findings between the current study and the cited one. 

I don't see any mention of goals or methods here, so it's not CoCoGM. There's no comparison between two other studies either, so CoCoXY isn't right. The citation isn't supporting their own results or pointing out similarities. The main action is contrasting results, so CoCoRes is the correct class.
