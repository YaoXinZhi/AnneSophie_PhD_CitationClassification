Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. The user provided a citation passage and wants me to determine the appropriate rhetorical class from the given list. 

First, I need to extract the context around the @@CITATION@@. The passage says: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." So the context here is that the current study's experimental setup was detailed in a prior work cited here.

Next, identify the general intent. The authors are referring to a previous description of their experimental setup. This seems like they're acknowledging that the setup wasn't new and was used from an earlier study. The intent here is to indicate that they're using an existing method or setup, which aligns with the "Usage" category because they're directly using the method from the cited work.

Looking at the definitions, "Usage" is when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup from the cited work that's directly used in the current study. The example given is similar: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@", which matches exactly. 

Comparing with other classes: It's not "Support" because they aren't confirming results, but rather using a method. Not "Basis" because it's not foundational theory. Not "CoCo" categories since there's no comparison. So "Usage" is the correct label here.
