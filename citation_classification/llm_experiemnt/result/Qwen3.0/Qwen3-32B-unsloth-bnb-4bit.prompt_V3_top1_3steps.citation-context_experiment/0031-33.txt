Okay, let me try to figure out the rhetorical class for this citation. The user provided a passage where the citation is mentioned in the context of comparing results. The example given is about the results differing from experiments with deuterium saturated metal targets. The key phrase here is "substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted... @@CITATION@@".

So, step one is extracting the context. The sentence is directly comparing the results of the current work with those from the cited paper. The general intent here seems to be a comparison of results, which falls under the Comparative category. Now, looking at the specific classes under Comparative, CoCoRes is for comparing results. The example given in the instructions for CoCoRes matches this scenario where the results are being contrasted. There's no mention of methods or goals here, just the results. Therefore, the correct class should be CoCoRes.
