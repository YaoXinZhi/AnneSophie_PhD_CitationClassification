Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. The user provided a passage with a citation and wants me to determine the correct rhetorical class from the given list.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage says: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." The key part here is that the citation refers to a previous description of the experimental setup. 

Next, identifying the intent. The phrase "was described in detail previously" suggests that the cited work is the source of the method or setup used in the current study. The authors are referencing where they got the experimental design from. 

Looking at the definitions, the "Usage" class is for when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup directly used in the current study. The example given is almost identical: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." So this matches the Usage category perfectly.

No other categories seem to fit here. It's not supporting a claim, comparing results, or pointing out weaknesses. It's straightforwardly indicating that the setup was previously detailed in the cited work. Therefore, the correct label should be Usage.
