Okay, let's see. I need to classify the citation in the given passage. The passage is about plant health, specifically dealing with biological classes in scientific citations. The task is to determine the rhetorical class of the cited work. 

First, I'll look at the example provided to understand the context. The example given under CoCoXY mentions comparing two cited studies with each other, not with the citing paper. The example talks about conflicting results between two studies on phytoplasma in daisy plants and Euphorbia pulcherrima, with the citation pointing out the conflicting results.

Now, applying this to the user's case. The passage says: "Fast multiplication rates and high concentration of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains have been reported in young developing leaves and roots of infected daisy plants (Wei et al., 2004; Saracco et al., 2006), although conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima @@CITATION@." 

Here, the authors are comparing two different studies (Wei et al. and Saracco et al.) which report certain findings, and then mention conflicting results in another study (the cited one). The citation here is used to highlight conflicting results between two studies (the ones on daisy plants versus Euphorbia pulcherrima). Since the comparison is between the cited studies themselves and not with the current paper's work, this fits the CoCoXY category, which is about comparing explanations or claims between cited works. 

The key here is that the citation is pointing out conflicting results between two other studies, not comparing the current paper's results or methods. So the correct class should be CoCoXY.
