Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. First, I need to look at the context around the citation. The sentence says, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." 

So the key part here is comparing the current results with those from a previous study. The phrase "substantially differ from" clearly indicates a comparison of results. According to the definitions provided, when a citation is used to directly compare or contrast results or findings, the appropriate class is CoCoRes. 

I should check if there's any other possible class that might fit. For example, CoCoGM is for comparing goals or methods, but the sentence here is about the results, not the methods or goals. CoCoXY involves comparing two cited studies with each other, not with the current paper. The example given for CoCoRes matches this scenario exactly, where the current work's results are contrasted with those in the cited work.

Therefore, the correct rhetorical class here is CoCoRes.
