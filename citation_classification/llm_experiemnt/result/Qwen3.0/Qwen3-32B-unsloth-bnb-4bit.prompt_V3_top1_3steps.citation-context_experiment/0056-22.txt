Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. The user provided a passage with a citation and wants me to determine the correct rhetorical class from the given options.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage is: "However, the detection of phytoplasma in host plants is often challenging due to the lack of specific symptoms @@CITATION@@." The key part here is that the citation is mentioned in the context of the challenge in detecting phytoplasma because symptoms aren't specific.

Next, identifying the general intent. The citation here is explaining a reason why detection is hardâ€”specifically, the lack of specific symptoms. This seems like it's providing a justification or a reason for the current research. The authors are pointing out a problem (lack of symptoms making detection challenging) which their work might be addressing. That aligns with the Motivation category because they're highlighting a knowledge gap or a need for their research.

Now, checking the specific rhetorical classes under Motivation. The example given for Motivation is when the citation identifies a knowledge gap or need. In this case, the citation is pointing out a challenge (lack of specific symptoms) that the current research is addressing. So the correct class here would be Motivation.
