Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in the given passage. The user provided the context and the example definitions.

First step is to extract the context around the citation. The passage is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." So the citation is being used to compare the results of their current work with those from the cited experiments.

Next, identify the general intent. The phrase "substantially differ from the results" indicates a comparison of results. According to the definitions, when comparing results directly, it falls under CoCoRes. The example given for CoCoRes is similar: comparing results of experiments. 

So the specific rhetorical class here should be CoCoRes.

CoCoRes
