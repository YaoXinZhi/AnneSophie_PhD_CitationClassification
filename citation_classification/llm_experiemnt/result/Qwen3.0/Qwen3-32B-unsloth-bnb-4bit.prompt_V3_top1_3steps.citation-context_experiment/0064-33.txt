Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The task is to determine the rhetorical class of the citation in the given passage. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage is: "To assess the efficacy of the proposed method, we conducted experiments comparing it with existing approaches described in @@CITATION@@." The relevant part here is that the authors are comparing their method with existing ones mentioned in the citation.

Next, identifying the general intent. The citation here is being used to compare their new method with existing approaches. From the definitions, comparative intents fall under CoCoGM, CoCoRes, or CoCoXY. Since the comparison is about methods (as they mention "existing approaches"), this fits CoCoGM, which is for comparing goals or methods. 

Looking at the example for CoCoGM: the citation is used to compare methods. The example says, "Most closely related... Our work is complementary, as we focus instead..." which is similar to the given passage where they compare their method with existing ones. 

Therefore, the correct class here is CoCoGM.
