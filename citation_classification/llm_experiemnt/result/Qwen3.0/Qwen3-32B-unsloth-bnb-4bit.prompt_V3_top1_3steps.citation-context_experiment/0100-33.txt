Okay, let's tackle this classification problem. First, I need to look at the passage provided and focus on the part where the citation is mentioned. The user has given an example passage with a citation tagged as @@CITATION@@. 

The passage says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@."

Step 1 is to extract the context around the citation. The key part here is that the authors are comparing their results to those from a previous study that used deuterium-saturated metal targets. The phrase "substantially differ" indicates a direct comparison of results.

Moving to Step 2, identifying the general intent. The authors are contrasting their findings with those of the cited work. This falls under Comparative intent because they're comparing results. According to the definitions, when comparing results or findings, it's CoCoRes.

Step 3 is selecting the specific rhetorical class. The example given for CoCoRes matches this scenario where the current work's results are compared directly with the cited experiments. The example mentions differing results, which aligns with the example provided in the problem statement.

Therefore, the correct label here should be CoCoRes.
