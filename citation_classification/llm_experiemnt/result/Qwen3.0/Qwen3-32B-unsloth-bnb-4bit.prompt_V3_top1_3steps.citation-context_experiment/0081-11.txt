Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. The user provided a passage with a citation and wants me to determine the appropriate rhetorical class from the given list.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage is: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." The key part here is that the citation is referring to where the experimental setup was previously described. 

Next, identifying the general intent. The phrase "was described in detail previously" suggests that the cited work is the source of the method or setup used in the current study. According to the definitions, if the citation is about using a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup from the cited work, it falls under the "Usage" category. 

Looking at the example for Usage: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." That's almost identical to the example provided in the task description for Usage. The current study is directly using the setup from the cited paper, so the intent is technical, referring to the use of a method or setup. 

Comparing with other classes: It's not supporting a result (Support), nor is it a comparison (CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY). There's no motivation or future direction suggested here. The citation isn't being used to point out a weakness or for a neutral description. Therefore, the most fitting class here is Usage.
