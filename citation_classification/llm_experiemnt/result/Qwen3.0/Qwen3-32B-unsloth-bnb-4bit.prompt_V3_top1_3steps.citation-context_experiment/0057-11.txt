Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in the given passage. First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." 

So the key part here is that the current study's results are being compared as substantially different from previous experiments. The citation here is referencing those previous experiments. The example given for CoCoRes mentions comparing results directly. The example provided is similar: "The results obtained... differ from... experiments... @@CITATION@." That matches the structure here.

The general intent here is to compare results, so the class should be CoCoRes. Let me check other possibilities. It's not Basis because it's not foundational. Not Motivation or Future. It's a direct comparison of results, so CoCoRes is correct.
