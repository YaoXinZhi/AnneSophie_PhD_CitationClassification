Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in the given passage. First, I should extract the context around the citation. The passage is about the effects of magnetic fields on water hardness and calcite scaling. The citation is mentioned in the sentence: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." 

The key part here is that the authors are referring to a previous study where the experimental setup was detailed. They're not comparing methods or results here; they're just stating that the setup was previously described. According to the definitions, the "Usage" class is when a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup from the cited work is directly used. In this case, they're using the experimental setup from the cited paper, so it fits the Usage category.

Let me double-check. The example given for Usage is when the setup was described in detail previously with a citation. That matches. So the correct label should be Usage.
