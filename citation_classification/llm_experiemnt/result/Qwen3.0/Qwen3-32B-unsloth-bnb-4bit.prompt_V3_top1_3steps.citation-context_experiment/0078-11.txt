Okay, let's tackle this classification task step by step. First, I need to look at the context around the citation to understand why it's being referenced. The passage says, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." 

So, the key part here is "substantially differ from the results of the experiments..." That immediately makes me think that the authors are comparing their results with those from the cited work. The rhetorical classes related to comparison include CoCoRes, which is specifically for comparing results. 

Looking at the definitions again, CoCoRes is when the citation is used to directly compare or contrast results or findings. The example given matches this scenario where the present work's results are contrasted with the cited ones. 

The other options don't fit here. It's not a foundational basis, motivation, future work, support, similar findings, usage of a method, weakness, or neutral mention. The main intent is to show a difference in results, so CoCoRes is the right choice.
