Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in the given passage. The passage is about plant health, specifically dealing with phytoplasma strains in daisy plants. The citation is mentioned in a context where two studies are being compared regarding conflicting results.

The sentence says: "Fast multiplication rates and high concentration of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains have been reported in young developing leaves and roots of infected daisy plants (Wei et al., 2004; Saracco et al., 2006), although conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima @@CITATION@." 

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The key part here is the mention of conflicting results in another study. The authors are pointing out that there are conflicting findings in the cited work compared to previous studies. 

Next, determining the intent. The phrase "conflicting results were described" suggests a comparison between different studies' outcomes. The citation is used to highlight a discrepancy between the cited study and others mentioned earlier. 

Looking at the definitions, CoCoXY is for comparing explanations or claims between cited studies without involving the current paper. Since the citation here contrasts the results of the cited work with another study (branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima versus the previous ones in daisy plants), this fits CoCoXY. The comparison is between two cited studies, not between the citing paper and the cited work. 

So the correct label should be CoCoXY.
