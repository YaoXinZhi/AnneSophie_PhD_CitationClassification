Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage says, "The use of molecular markers has become a standard practice in plant health studies to identify genetic resistance. For example, @@CITATION@@ demonstrated the effectiveness of SSR markers in detecting resistance genes in wheat against rust pathogens." 

So the key part here is that the citation is providing an example where SSR markers were shown to be effective. The intent seems to be supporting the current discussion by citing a specific study that confirmed the effectiveness. 

Looking at the definitions, "Support" is when the citation is used to support or confirm the work of the citing authors. The example given in the Support class mentions a study that aligns with their findings. Here, the authors are using the citation to back up their point about molecular markers being effective, so this fits the Support category.
