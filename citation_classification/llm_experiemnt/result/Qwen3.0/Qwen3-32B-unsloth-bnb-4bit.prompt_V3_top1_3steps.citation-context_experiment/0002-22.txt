Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage is: "The identification of pathogenic bacteria in plant tissues is crucial for effective disease management. @@CITATION@@ developed a novel molecular technique that enhances the accuracy of bacterial detection in symptomatic and asymptomatic plants. This method was adapted in our study to improve diagnostic reliability." 

So, the citation is mentioned right after discussing the importance of identifying pathogenic bacteria. The authors of the cited work developed a new molecular technique which the current study adapted. 

Next, determining the intent. The citation here is referencing a method that the current research uses. The phrase "was adapted in our study" indicates that the cited work's method is being utilized. According to the definitions, when a citation refers to a method or tool used in the current study, it falls under the 'Usage' category. 

Looking at the example provided for 'Usage', it mentions an experimental setup described in a previous study. Similarly, here, the molecular technique from the cited work is directly used, so 'Usage' is the appropriate class.
