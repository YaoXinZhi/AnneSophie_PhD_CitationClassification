Okay, let's tackle this classification task step by step. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." 

Looking at this, the key part is "substantially differ from the results of..." which directly points to a comparison between the current study's results and those cited. According to the guidelines, when the citation is used to compare or contrast results, the appropriate class is CoCoRes. 

The example given for CoCoRes matches this scenario exactly, where the present work's results are compared with those from the cited paper. There's no mention of methods, goals, or explanations here, so CoCoRes is the right fit. The other classes like Basis or Support don't apply here because the citation isn't establishing a foundation or supporting the current work's claims. It's about differing results, so CoCoRes is the most accurate label.
