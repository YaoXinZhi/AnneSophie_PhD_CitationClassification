Okay, let's start by looking at the given passage. The citation is mentioned in the sentence: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The key part here is the comparison between the present work's results and those from the cited experiments. The phrase "substantially differ" indicates a direct contrast of results.

Next, identifying the general intent. Since the citation is used to compare results of the current study with previous ones, this falls under the Comparative category. The specific type here is comparing results, which according to the definitions provided, points to CoCoRes. 

Looking at the example given for CoCoRes, it's about differing results from cited experiments, which matches the structure here. The example mentions "substantially differ from the results of the experiments," similar to our case. 

Therefore, the most appropriate rhetorical class here is CoCoRes.
