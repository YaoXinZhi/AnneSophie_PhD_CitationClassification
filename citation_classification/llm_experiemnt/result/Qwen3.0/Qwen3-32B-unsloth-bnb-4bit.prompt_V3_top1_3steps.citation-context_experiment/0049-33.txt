Okay, let's start by looking at the given passage. The user provided a scientific article passage with a citation marked as @@CITATION@@. My task is to determine the rhetorical class of that citation.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." So the context is comparing the current results to previous experiments that used different metal targets.

Next, I need to figure out the general intent here. The key phrase is "substantially differ from the results of..." which indicates a direct comparison between the current study's findings and those cited. This fits under the comparative category. Now, looking at the specific comparative classes: CoCoRes is for comparing results or findings. The example given for CoCoRes mentions differing results between the present work and cited experiments, which matches exactly what's happening here. The citation is being used to highlight a contrast in results between the two studies.

So the specific rhetorical class should be CoCoRes. There's no mention of methods or goals, just the results themselves. Also, it's not a neutral statement or a basis for the current work. The authors are pointing out a difference in outcomes, which is a direct comparison of results.
