Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage is: "The impact of climate change on plant health is increasingly concerning, as evidenced by recent studies such as @@CITATION@@, which highlight shifts in pest and disease dynamics." 

The key part here is that the citation is presented as an example of recent studies showing shifts in pest and disease dynamics related to climate change. 

Next, identifying the general intent. The phrase "as evidenced by recent studies" suggests that the citation is being used to support the claim that climate change affects plant health. The authors are using the cited work to back up their assertion, so the intent is supportive.

Now, looking at the specific rhetorical classes. Support is when the citation confirms the work's findings. The example given for Support mentions that subscales were consistent with previous research. Here, the cited study is supporting the current claim about pest and disease dynamics. There's no direct comparison or criticism, just support. So the correct class should be Support.
