Okay, let me try to figure out the rhetorical class for this citation. The passage is: "The most commonly used approach to identify potential host plant resistance mechanisms is the comparison of non-infested and infested plants. @@CITATION@@ applied this approach to study the effects of infestation with the citrus psyllid Diaphorina citri on its host plant, the citrus tree."

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The sentence says that the cited work applied the approach mentioned (comparing non-infested and infested plants) to study the effects of citrus psyllid on citrus trees. 

Next, identify the general intent. The citation is being used to show that the cited work used the same method (the comparison approach) but applied it to a specific case. The citing paper is talking about the common approach and then gives an example where someone used it. 

Looking at the options, this seems like a comparison of methods or goals (CoCoGM) because they're contrasting how the cited work applied the approach. Alternatively, maybe Support if they're confirming the approach's validity. But the example here is more about illustrating that the approach was used in a specific study rather than supporting their own findings. 

Wait, the example in CoCoGM mentions comparing goals or methods. Here, the cited work's method (applying the comparison approach to citrus psyllid) is being contrasted with the general approach mentioned. So it's a comparison of methods between the cited work and the citing paper's discussion. Therefore, the rhetorical class should be CoCoGM.
