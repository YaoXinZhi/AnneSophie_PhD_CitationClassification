Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. First, I need to look at the citation passage provided. The user hasn't given the actual text, but let's assume a typical example for demonstration. Suppose the citation is in a sentence like: "The effectiveness of this treatment was confirmed by previous studies, such as the work by @@CITATION@@ which demonstrated similar outcomes."

Step 1: Extract the context around the citation. The relevant part here is that the citation is used to confirm the effectiveness by referencing previous studies that showed similar results.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The author is supporting their current findings by citing a study that aligns with their results. This points towards a supportive intent.

Step 3: Determine the specific rhetorical class. Since the citation is used to support or confirm the current work's findings, the appropriate class would be "Support". The example given in the definitions also uses "Support" when the cited work's results align with the current study's findings.
