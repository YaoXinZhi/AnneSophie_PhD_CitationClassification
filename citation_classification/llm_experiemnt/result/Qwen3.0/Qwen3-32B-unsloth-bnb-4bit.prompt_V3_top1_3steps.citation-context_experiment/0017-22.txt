Okay, let's start by looking at the citation passage provided. The user wants me to classify the rhetorical class of the cited work here. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage says, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." 

So the key part here is comparing the current results with those from a previous study. The phrase "substantially differ" indicates that the authors are contrasting their findings with the cited work's findings. 

Next, according to the task steps, I need to determine the general intent. Comparing results falls under the Comparative category. The specific subclass here is CoCoRes, which is for comparing results or findings directly. 

Looking at the example provided for CoCoRes, it's exactly a similar structure where the results are compared. The example mentions differing results from a cited study, just like in the given passage. 

Therefore, the correct rhetorical class here should be CoCoRes.
