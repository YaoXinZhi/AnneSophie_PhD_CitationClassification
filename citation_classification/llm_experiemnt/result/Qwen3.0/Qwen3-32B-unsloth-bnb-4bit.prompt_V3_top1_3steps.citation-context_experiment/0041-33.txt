Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. The passage is: "The development of resistant cultivars is considered one of the most effective strategies to manage plant diseases. @@CITATION@@ reported that resistance genes can be introgressed from wild relatives into cultivated species through traditional breeding methods." 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The sentence says that resistant cultivars are effective, and then cites a study that reported resistance genes can be introgressed via traditional breeding. The intent here seems to be supporting the claim that resistant cultivars are effective by citing a source that provides evidence on how resistance genes are transferred.

Next, determining the general intent. The citation is used to back up the statement about resistant cultivars being effective. The authors are referencing a study that shows the method of introducing resistance genes, which supports their own assertion. So this falls under supportive intent.

Now, choosing the specific rhetorical class. The example for "Support" mentions citing to support or confirm the work of the citing authors. Here, the citation is providing evidence that resistance genes can be introgressed, which supports the claim made in the first part of the sentence. There's no comparison or contrast happening, no criticism, and it's not about future work or motivation. It's directly supporting the statement with a study's result. So the correct class should be "Support".
