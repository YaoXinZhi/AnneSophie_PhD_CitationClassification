Okay, let's start by looking at the citation in the passage. The sentence says, "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." The key part here is "described in detail previously," which indicates that the cited work provides the setup that the current study is using.

So, the context is about referencing where the experimental setup was first detailed. The intent here isn't to compare methods or results, nor is it supporting a claim. Instead, it's pointing out that the setup was previously described by the cited source. 

Looking at the rhetorical classes, the Usage category fits when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup used in the current study. Since the citation here is about the experimental setup being used, directly referencing the previous work's setup, this aligns with the Usage class. 

The example given under Usage mentions an experimental set-up described previously, which matches exactly what's happening here. There's no indication of criticism, support, comparison, or motivation. It's a direct reference to the method used, so Usage is the correct label.
