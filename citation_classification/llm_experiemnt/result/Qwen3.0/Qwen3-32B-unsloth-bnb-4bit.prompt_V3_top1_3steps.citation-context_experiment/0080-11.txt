Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions a study by @@CITATION@@ that found high concentrations of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains in young leaves and roots of infected daisies. Then it contrasts that with conflicting results from another study on Euphorbia pulcherrima. The citation here is used to compare two different studies' findings regarding phytoplasma concentrations.

Next, identifying the intent. The key here is that the citation is contrasting the results of the cited study with another one mentioned earlier. The example given for CoCoXY involves comparing two cited studies with each other, not the current paper. Since the context here is about contrasting results between two studies, this fits the CoCoRes category because it's a direct comparison of results between the cited work and another study. Wait, but the example for CoCoXY is about comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies. Hmm, need to be careful. The example given in CoCoRes is comparing results of the current work with cited experiments. In this case, the current paper isn't directly involved; it's comparing two cited studies. So maybe CoCoXY is more appropriate here because it's comparing explanations or claims between two cited works. Wait, the example for CoCoXY mentions conflicting results between two studies. Let me check again. The example says "conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima @@CITATION@@", which contrasts with the previous study's findings. So this is a comparison of results between two cited studies, not the current paper's results. Therefore, according to the definitions, CoCoRes is when comparing the current paper's results with cited works, while CoCoXY is comparing cited works with each other. Since the current example is comparing two cited studies, it should be CoCoXY. Wait, the example given for CoCoXY says "comparison or contrast of two cited studies with each other â€” not with the citing paper." So in this case, the citation is part of a comparison between two studies (the one cited and another mentioned earlier). Therefore, the correct class here is CoCoXY.
