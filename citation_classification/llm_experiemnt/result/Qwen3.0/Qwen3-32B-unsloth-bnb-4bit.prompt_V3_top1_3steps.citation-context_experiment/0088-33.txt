Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. The user provided a citation passage from a scientific article in the plant health domain and wants me to assign the correct rhetorical class to the cited reference. 

First, I need to extract the context around the @@CITATION@@. The passage is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." 

So the key part here is that the authors are comparing their results to those from a previous study that used deuterium-saturated metal targets. The phrase "substantially differ" indicates a direct comparison of results. 

Next, I need to determine the general intent. Since they're contrasting their findings with those of the cited work, this falls under the Comparative category. The specific type here is comparing results, not methods or goals. Looking at the definitions, CoCoRes is for comparing results or findings. 

Now, checking the example given for CoCoRes: the example mentions differing results from a cited experiment, which matches the structure here. The user's example and the given passage both use the citation to highlight differences in experimental outcomes. 

Therefore, the correct rhetorical class should be CoCoRes.
