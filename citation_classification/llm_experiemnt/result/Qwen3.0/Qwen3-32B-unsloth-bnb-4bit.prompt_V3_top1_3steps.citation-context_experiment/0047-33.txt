Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The given passage is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@."

So the context is about comparing the current results with those from another study that used deuterium-saturated metal targets. The key phrase here is "substantially differ from the results of..." which indicates a direct comparison between the results of the current work and the cited work.

Next, identifying the general intent. Since the authors are contrasting their results with those from the cited study, this falls under Comparative intent. According to the guidelines, Comparative intent leads to classes like CoCoGM, CoCoRes, or CoCoXY. Now, the example given for CoCoRes mentions comparing results or findings directly. The example provided is similar to the one here, where the present work's results are compared to the cited experiments' results. 

The citation isn't comparing goals or methods (CoCoGM) or explanations between two other studies (CoCoXY). It's a direct result comparison between the current paper and the cited work. Therefore, the correct class here is CoCoRes.
