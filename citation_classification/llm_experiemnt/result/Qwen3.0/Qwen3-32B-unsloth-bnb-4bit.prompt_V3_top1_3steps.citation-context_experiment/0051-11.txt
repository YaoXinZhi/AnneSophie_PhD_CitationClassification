Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the rhetorical class for this citation. The passage is talking about the effect of magnetic treatment on water hardness. The authors mention that their previous research showed magnetic treatment prevents calcite scale formation, and they reference @@CITATION@@ here. Then they explain that the mechanism isn't known yet, so this study aims to understand it.

First, step one is extracting the context around the citation. The citation is right after stating their previous research showed the prevention of calcite scale using magnetic fields. The next sentence says the explanation isn't offered yet, leading to the purpose of the current work. So the citation here is pointing to their own prior work that established the phenomenon but didn't explain it.

Step two is identifying the intent. The citation is used to justify why the current research is being done. They found a result before (using the citation), but there's a gap in understanding the mechanism. That's a knowledge gap, which is a reason to conduct new research. According to the definitions, Motivation is when the citation justifies the current research by pointing out a need or gap. 

Step three is selecting the specific class. The example for Motivation includes citing previous work that shows a result but leaves an explanation unaddressed, prompting the current study. Here, the authors reference their own prior work (the citation) to show that while they achieved a result, the mechanism isn't known, hence motivating the current research. So the rhetorical class should be Motivation.
