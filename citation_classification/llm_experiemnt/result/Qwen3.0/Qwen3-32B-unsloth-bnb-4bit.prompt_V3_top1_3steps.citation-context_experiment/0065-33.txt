Okay, let's tackle this citation classification. First, I need to look at the context around the @@CITATION@@. The passage says, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." 

So the key part here is comparing the current results with those from the cited work. The phrase "substantially differ" indicates a direct comparison of results. According to the definitions, CoCoRes is when the citation is used to compare or contrast results. The example given in the instructions matches this scenario exactly. The authors are pointing out how their findings are different from the cited study's results. There's no mention of methods or goals here, just the outcomes. Therefore, the rhetorical class should be CoCoRes.
