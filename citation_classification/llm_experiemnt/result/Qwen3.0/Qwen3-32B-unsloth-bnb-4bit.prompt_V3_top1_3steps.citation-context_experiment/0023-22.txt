Okay, let's see. I need to classify the citation in the given passage. The passage is about plant health, specifically dealing with pathogens causing diseases in plants.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The sentence says, "The disease symptoms caused by @@CITATION@@ include leaf spots, yellowing, and wilting." The author is describing the symptoms associated with the cited work's pathogen.

Next, I need to determine the general intent. The citation here is being used to report the symptoms caused by the pathogen mentioned in the cited study. It's a straightforward description of the disease symptoms without any comparison, support, criticism, or motivation. The author is just stating facts from the cited work regarding the symptoms observed.

Looking at the rhetorical classes, the Neutral class fits here because the citation is used in a descriptive manner without supporting, comparing, or criticizing. The example given for Neutral mentions a citation used in a neutral, descriptive way, which aligns with this case. The author isn't arguing a point but simply reporting symptoms as described in the cited study.
