Okay, let me try to work through this step by step. So the task is to classify the citation into one of the given rhetorical classes. The passage provided is:

"The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@."

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The sentence says their results differ from experiments that used deuterium-saturated metal targets cited here. The key part is comparing their results with those from the cited work.

Next, determine the general intent. The paper is contrasting their findings with the cited study's results. The predefined categories mention Comparative intents like CoCoRes for comparing results. The example given for CoCoRes is exactly a case where results are compared. Here, the authors state their results "substantially differ," which is a direct comparison of results.

So the specific class should be CoCoRes because it's a comparison of experimental outcomes between the current work and the cited paper. There's no mention of methods or goals, just the results. Therefore, CoCoRes is the correct label.
