Okay, let's see. I need to classify the citation in the given passage. First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage says, "The impact of climate change on plant health is increasingly recognized as a critical area of study. @@CITATION@@ has highlighted the role of rising temperatures in exacerbating pest outbreaks, which aligns with our findings on the increased prevalence of aphids in warmer regions."

So the context is about climate change affecting plant health, specifically mentioning that the cited work pointed out rising temperatures leading to pest outbreaks, which matches their own findings on aphids in warmer areas. The general intent here seems to be supportive because they're using the citation to back up their own results. The example for 'Support' mentions that the citation confirms their work, so this fits. The rhetorical class should be Support.

Step 1: Extracted context: "The impact of climate change on plant health is increasingly recognized as a critical area of study. @@CITATION@@ has highlighted the role of rising temperatures in exacerbating pest outbreaks, which aligns with our findings on the increased prevalence of aphids in warmer regions."

Step 2: The citation is used to confirm the citing authors' findings about temperature-pest relationships. This aligns with the "Support" intent category.

Step 3: The specific example matches the Support class definition where the cited work corroborates the authors' own findings.

Support
