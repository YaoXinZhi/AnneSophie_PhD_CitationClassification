Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in the given passage. First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage says: "The effectiveness of the proposed method was validated through experiments comparing it with existing approaches. The results showed significant improvements over the methods described in @@CITATION@@." 

So, the citation here is being used to compare the results of the current study with those of the cited work. The key words are "comparing it with existing approaches" and "improvements over the methods described." That suggests a comparison of results because they're showing their results are better than what was previously done.

Looking at the classes, CoCoRes is for comparing results. The example given for CoCoRes mentions differing results, which aligns with this case where they're showing their results are better. The citation isn't just supporting their claim but directly contrasting the outcomes. So the rhetorical class should be CoCoRes.
