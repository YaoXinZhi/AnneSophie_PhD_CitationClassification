Okay, let's tackle this classification task. So the user provided a scientific passage with a citation marked as @@CITATION@@, and I need to figure out which rhetorical class it belongs to. The options are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Motivation, Future, Support, Similar, Usage, Weakness, Neutral.

First, I'll start by looking at the context around the citation. The passage says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." 

So the key part here is "substantially differ from the results of the experiments..." which directly mentions comparing results between the current work and the cited study. According to the step-by-step instructions, if the citation is used to compare results, it falls under CoCoRes. 

Let me cross-check the example given for CoCoRes: the example mentions differing results between the present work and the cited paper. The user's passage is similar because it's stating that their results differ from those in the cited work. That matches the definition of CoCoRes, which is about comparing results. 

I should make sure it's not another class. For example, CoCoGM is about goals or methods, which isn't the case here. Basis would be foundational work, but the context is about differing results, not the foundation. Support would be if they're confirming the cited work, but here it's the oppositeâ€”highlighting differences. Weakness would involve criticizing the cited work, but the passage is more about their own results differing rather than pointing out flaws. Neutral is descriptive, but this is a direct comparison of results. 

So the correct class here is CoCoRes.
