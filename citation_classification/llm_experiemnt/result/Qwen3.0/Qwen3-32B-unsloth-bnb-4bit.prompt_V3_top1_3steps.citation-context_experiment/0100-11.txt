Okay, let's tackle this classification task step by step. First, I need to look at the passage provided and identify the context around the citation. The user mentioned the passage is about plant health, so I should focus on biological aspects related to plants.

The passage says: "The pathogenicity of the isolate was confirmed by inoculating healthy plants with a spore suspension, resulting in typical symptoms of the disease, as described by @@CITATION@@." 

Step 1: Extracting the context. The citation here is referring to a study where the symptoms of the disease were described. The current research confirmed the pathogenicity by causing those symptoms, which were previously outlined in the cited work.

Step 2: Identifying the general intent. The authors are using the citation to show that their results align with previously described symptoms. This seems like a supportive reference because they're confirming their findings with existing literature. The intent is to support their current results by referencing a prior study that documented the same symptoms.

Step 3: Choosing the specific rhetorical class. Looking at the options, "Support" is when the citation supports or confirms the work of the citing authors. The example given for Support mentions consistency with previous research. Here, the symptoms observed match those in the cited work, so it's supporting their conclusion that the isolate is pathogenic. Therefore, the correct class should be Support.
