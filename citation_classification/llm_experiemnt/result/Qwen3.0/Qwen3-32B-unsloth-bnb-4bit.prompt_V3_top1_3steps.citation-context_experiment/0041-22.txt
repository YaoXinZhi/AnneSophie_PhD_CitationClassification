Okay, let's start by looking at the citation passage provided. The user wants me to classify the rhetorical role of the cited work. 

First, I need to extract the context around the @@CITATION@@. The passage says, “The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@.” 

So the key part here is comparing the current results with those from the cited work. The phrase “substantially differ” indicates a direct comparison of results. 

Next, I check the general intent. Since the citation is contrasting results, that falls under Comparative intent. Now, looking at the specific classes under Comparative: CoCoRes is for comparing results, which matches this context. 

The example given for CoCoRes is very similar: comparing results of the current work with the cited one. Therefore, the correct class here is CoCoRes.
