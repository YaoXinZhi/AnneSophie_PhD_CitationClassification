Okay, let's see. I need to classify the citation in the given passage. The user provided the context and the steps.

First, the passage is: "The most common symptoms of citrus canker include raised, cork-like lesions on leaves and stems, which may be surrounded by a yellow halo. These symptoms are characteristic of bacterial infection by Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri (Xcc) @@CITATION@@." 

Step 1 is extracting the context around the citation. The relevant part is mentioning the symptoms and then citing the bacterium responsible. 

Step 2 is identifying the intent. The citation here is introducing the specific bacterium associated with the symptoms described. It's providing foundational information, establishing that Xcc is the cause. So the intent is foundational, pointing to Basis.

Step 3 is choosing the specific class. Since it's introducing the basis for the current discussion about the disease, Basis seems right. The example for Basis mentions introducing and validating something, which aligns with identifying the causative agent here. So the label should be Basis.

Basis
