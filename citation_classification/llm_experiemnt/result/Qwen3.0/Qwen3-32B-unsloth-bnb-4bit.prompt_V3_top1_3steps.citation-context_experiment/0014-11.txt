Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in the given passage. The passage is about plant health, specifically mentioning the use of a method for early detection of citrus canker using hyperspectral imaging. The citation here is from a study by Mendoza-Figueroa et al., 2018.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The sentence says that hyperspectral imaging was used as a non-destructive technique for early detection of citrus canker, and it's cited to Mendoza-Figueroa et al., 2018. The next sentence mentions another study by Mendoza-Figueroa et al., 2020, discussing the detection of citrus canker symptoms in the red and blue spectral ranges. 

The intent here seems to be supporting the current study's methodology. The authors are referencing previous works that also used hyperspectral imaging for citrus canker detection, indicating that their approach builds on existing methods. The citation is used to back up the claim that hyperspectral imaging is effective for this purpose. 

Looking at the classes, "Support" would fit because they're citing previous studies to confirm or support their own findings or methods. The example given for Support mentions that the citation supports the work of the citing authors. In this case, the cited works are examples of similar methods used before, supporting the current application. 

I don't think it's Basis because they're not establishing the foundation but rather showing that others have done similar things. It's not a comparison (CoCoGM/Res/XY) since they aren't contrasting goals, results, or explanations. It's not Motivation or Future either. Weakness isn't applicable here as there's no criticism. Neutral is when it's just descriptive, but here it's more about supporting their approach. So the best fit is Support.

Step 1: Extracted context: "Hyperspectral imaging was used as a non-destructive technique for early detection of citrus canker symptoms caused by Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri... Mendoza-Figueroa et al. (2018) reported the use of hyperspectral imaging..."

Step 2: General intent is foundational/supportive - establishing hyperspectral imaging as a validated method for citrus canker detection that supports the current research's methodology.

Step 3: Specific rhetorical class selection - **Support**. The citation confirms the validity of hyperspectral imaging as a technique for citrus canker detection, directly supporting the methodology described in the current paper.
