Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage says, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." 

So the key part here is comparing the current results with those from the cited work. The phrase "substantially differ" indicates a direct comparison of results. 

Next, identifying the general intent. Since the authors are contrasting their findings with previous experiments, this falls under Comparative, specifically comparing results. 

Looking at the rhetorical classes, CoCoRes is for comparing or contrasting results. The example given in the guidelines matches this scenario where results are directly compared. 

Therefore, the correct label here should be CoCoRes.
