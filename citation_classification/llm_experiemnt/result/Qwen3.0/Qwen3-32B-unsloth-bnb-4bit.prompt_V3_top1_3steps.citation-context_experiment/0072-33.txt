Okay, let's start by looking at the passage provided. The user has given me a scientific article passage with a citation tagged as @@CITATION@@. My task is to determine the rhetorical class of this citation.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@."

So the context is that the authors are comparing their results to previous experiments. The key phrase here is "substantially differ from the results of the experiments," followed by the citation. The citation is referencing prior work that conducted experiments with deuterium-saturated metal targets. 

Next, I need to identify the general intent. The authors are pointing out a difference between their findings and those of the cited work. According to the step-by-step guide, when a citation is used to directly compare or contrast results or findings, the intent falls under "Comparative" and specifically under CoCoRes (Comparison of Results). 

Looking at the example provided for CoCoRes: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." This matches the structure exactly. 

Therefore, the correct rhetorical class here is CoCoRes because the citation is used to compare results between the current study and the cited work.
