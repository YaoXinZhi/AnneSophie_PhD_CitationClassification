Okay, let's start by looking at the citation passage provided. The sentence is: "The effectiveness of the method was validated through experiments described in @@CITATION@@." 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The key part here is that the method's effectiveness is being validated by experiments mentioned in the cited work. The authors are using this citation to show that their method has been tested and proven effective based on previous experiments.

Next, determining the general intent. Since they're validating their method using experiments from another study, this seems supportive. The citation is providing evidence or confirmation that their approach works, which aligns with the Support category. 

Now, checking the specific rhetorical classes under Supportive. The example given for Support mentions that the citation supports or confirms the work of the citing authors. In this case, the cited experiments are used to back up the current study's method's effectiveness. There's no indication of similarity or comparison here, just direct support. 

So the most appropriate class here would be Support.
