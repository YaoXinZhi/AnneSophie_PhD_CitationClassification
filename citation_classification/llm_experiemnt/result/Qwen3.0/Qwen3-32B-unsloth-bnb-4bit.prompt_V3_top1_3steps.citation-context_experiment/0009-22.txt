Okay, let's tackle this classification task. First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage is talking about a study that found certain phytoplasma strains in young leaves and roots, but there were conflicting results mentioned in another study cited here. The example given is about comparing two cited studies, not contrasting with the current paper's work.

Next, identifying the intent. The key phrase is "although conflicting results were described..." which indicates that the citation is being used to compare two different studies' findings. The example provided under CoCoXY mentions conflicting results between two studies, which aligns with this scenario. 

So the rhetorical class here is CoCoXY because it's comparing explanations or claims between two cited works. The citation isn't about the current paper's methods or results but is pointing out a conflict between two other studies. Therefore, the correct label should be CoCoXY.
