Okay, let me try to work through this step by step. The user provided a citation passage and wants me to classify it into one of the rhetorical classes. 

First, I need to look at the passage where the citation is mentioned. The example given is from a scientific article about plant health. Let me read the example again to understand the context. 

The example passage is: "Fast multiplication rates and high concentration of two 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains have been reported in young developing leaves and roots of infected daisy plants (Wei et al., 2004; Saracco et al., 2006), although conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima @@CITATION@@."

So the citation here is being used to mention conflicting results between two studies. The key part is "conflicting results were described for..." which indicates that the cited work is being compared with another study (the ones mentioned before the citation) in terms of their explanations or claims. 

Looking at the definitions, CoCoXY is when the citation is used to compare two cited studies with each other, not with the current paper. The example given for CoCoXY is about comparing two studies' results. In the provided passage, the authors mention conflicting results in a different study (the one cited) compared to the previous ones. So this seems to fit CoCoXY because they're contrasting two cited works (Wei et al. and Saracco et al. vs. the cited one) regarding their findings on phytoplasma.

Step 1: Extract context around the citation. The context is about conflicting results in a study on Euphorbia pulcherrima. 

Step 2: Identify intent. The intent here is to compare the results or claims of two different cited works (the ones before the citation and the cited one). 

Step 3: Assign the specific class. Since it's comparing two cited studies (not the current paper), it's CoCoXY.
