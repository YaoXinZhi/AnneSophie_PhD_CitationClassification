Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. The task is to determine the rhetorical class of the given citation in the provided passage. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@."

The key part here is the phrase "substantially differ from the results of the experiments..." which directly compares the current results with those from the cited work. According to the definitions, when a citation is used to compare or contrast results, the appropriate class is CoCoRes. 

Looking at the examples provided for CoCoRes, the example given is almost identical in structure to the current passage. Both mention differing results between the current work and the cited study. There's no indication of supporting, motivating, or criticizing hereâ€”just a direct comparison of findings. 

So, the general intent here is comparative, specifically comparing results. The specific class would therefore be CoCoRes.
