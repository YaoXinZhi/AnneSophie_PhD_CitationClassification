Okay, let's tackle this classification problem step by step. The task is to determine the correct rhetorical class for the citation marked as @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage provided is:

"@@CITATION@@ demonstrated that the presence of the pathogen significantly reduces the yield of the crop. Our study confirms these findings and extends them by showing the impact on soil health."

The relevant context here is the sentence mentioning the citation's role in demonstrating a reduction in crop yield due to a pathogen. The next part says their study confirms these findings and extends them by looking at soil health impact.

Next, I need to identify the general intent. The citation here is being referenced to show that the cited work found something (pathogen reduces yield), and the current study confirms these findings. This seems like the citation is being used to support the current research's claims. 

Looking at the categories, Support is when the citation is used to support or confirm the work, results, or findings of the citing authors. The example given for Support mentions consistency with previous research. In this case, confirming the findings would fall under Support. 

I should check if any other categories might fit. Basis is about foundational work, but here it's confirming existing results, not establishing the foundation. CoCoRes involves comparing results, but the passage isn't contrasting or comparing different resultsâ€”it's confirming. Motivation would be if the citation is showing a gap or need, which isn't the case here. Weakness would involve criticism, which isn't present. Neutral is descriptive without supporting or comparing, but here they're actively supporting their findings with the citation. 

Therefore, the correct class should be Support.

#Step 1: Extracted context: "@@CITATION@@ demonstrated that the presence of the pathogen significantly reduces the yield of the crop. Our study confirms these findings..."

#Step 2: General intent is Supportive (the citation is used to support/confirm the citing authors' work)

#Step 3: Specific rhetorical class label

Support
