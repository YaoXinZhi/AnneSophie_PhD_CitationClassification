Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. First, I need to look at the passage provided and identify the context around the citation. The user mentioned that the citation is tagged as @@CITATION@@, so I need to focus on the surrounding text.

The passage says: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." The key part here is "was described in detail previously." The authors are referring to a prior work where the setup was already detailed. 

Now, moving to Step 2: Identifying the general intent. The phrase "was described in detail previously" suggests that the cited work provided the method or setup that the current study is using. This seems like a reference to a method or experimental setup that's being reused. 

Looking at the definitions, the Usage class is for when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup from the cited work that's directly used in the current study. The example given is similar: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." 

So the intent here is technical, referring to the use of a previously established setup. Therefore, the correct rhetorical class should be Usage.
