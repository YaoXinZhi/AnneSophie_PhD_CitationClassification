Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. First, I need to look at the context around the citation mentioned in the passage. The user provided a scientific article passage where the citation is tagged as @@CITATION@@. 

Looking at the example given, the passage is: “The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@.”

So, the context is about comparing the results of the current study with those from previous experiments that used deuterium-saturated metal targets. The key phrase here is “substantially differ from the results of... @@CITATION@”. 

Next, I need to determine the general intent of the citation. The authors are contrasting their findings with those from the cited work. This falls under the Comparative category. Now, among the comparative classes, the example given is CoCoRes because they are directly comparing results. 

The example provided for CoCoRes is almost identical to the case here, where the current results are compared with those from the cited experiments. There's a direct mention of differing results. 

Therefore, the specific rhetorical class here should be CoCoRes. I don't see any elements of motivation, support, or other categories here. The main point is a direct comparison of results between the current work and the cited study.
