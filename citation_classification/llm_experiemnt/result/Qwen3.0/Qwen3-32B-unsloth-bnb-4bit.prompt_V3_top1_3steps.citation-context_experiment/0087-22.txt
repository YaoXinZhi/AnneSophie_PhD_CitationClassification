Okay, let's start by looking at the passage provided. The user mentioned a citation passage in the plant health domain, but the actual passage isn't shown here. Wait, maybe I missed that part. Let me check again.

Wait, the user provided the task instructions and an example, but the actual input passage isn't included here. Hmm. Oh, perhaps this is a test scenario where the actual input isn't visible, and I'm supposed to simulate the reasoning based on the given example. Wait, no, the user is asking me to process their specific input. Wait, maybe I need to consider the example given in the task description. Let me look at the example provided in the definitions again.

For instance, in the CoCoXY example, the citation is used to compare two cited studies with each other, not with the citing paper. The example mentions conflicting results between two studies. So, the key here is comparing explanations or claims between two cited works.

Assuming that the actual passage given by the user is similar to that example, where the citation is pointing out conflicting results between two studies (like Wei et al., 2004 and Saracco et al., 2006) regarding phytoplasma in plants, then the rhetorical class would be CoCoXY. The citation is used to contrast different findings in the cited studies themselves, not comparing with the current paper's work. 

So, following the steps: first, extract the context around the citation. If the context mentions conflicting results between two previous studies, then the intent is to compare their explanations or claims. Hence, the correct class is CoCoXY.
