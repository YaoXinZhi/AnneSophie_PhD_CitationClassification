Okay, let's start by looking at the passage provided. The citation is mentioned in the context of a study that used a specific method involving magnetic fields to prevent calcite scale formation. The authors reference their previous research (the citation) where they showed that magnetic fields can prevent scale formation but note that the explanation wasn't provided. The purpose of the current work is to understand the mechanism behind this effect.

First, I need to extract the relevant context around the citation. The key part is where they mention their previous research demonstrated the effectiveness of magnetic fields, but the explanation is still lacking, prompting the current study. 

Next, determining the intent. The citation here is used to justify why the current research is being conducted. The previous work showed a result (prevention of scale), but there's an open question about the mechanism. This fits under the Motivational category because it's identifying a knowledge gap that motivates the current research.

Looking at the examples for Motivation, the example mentions previous research showing a phenomenon without explanation, leading to the current study's purpose. That matches the context here. So the rhetorical class should be Motivation.
