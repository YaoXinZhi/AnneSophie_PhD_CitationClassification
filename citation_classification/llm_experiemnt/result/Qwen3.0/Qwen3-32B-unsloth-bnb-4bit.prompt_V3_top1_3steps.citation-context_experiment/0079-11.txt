Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in the given passage. The passage is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@."

First, step one is to extract the context around the citation. The key part here is comparing the results of the current work with those from the cited experiments. The phrase "substantially differ from the results" is a direct comparison of findings.

Next, step two is identifying the general intent. Since the citation is used to compare results between the current study and the cited work, this falls under Comparative intent. The specific type here is comparing results, so according to the definitions, that's CoCoRes.

Step three is selecting the specific class. The example given for CoCoRes is when results are directly compared. The example in the user's prompt matches this scenario exactly. So the correct label here should be CoCoRes.
