Okay, let me try to work through this step by step. So the task is to classify the citation in the given passage into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." 

Step 1: Extracting the context. The key part here is that the authors are stating their results differ from previous experiments that used deuterium saturated metal targets, and the citation is referencing those experiments.

Step 2: Identifying the general intent. The phrase "substantially differ from the results" indicates a comparison of results between the current study and the cited work. According to the definitions, this falls under the Comparative category, specifically CoCoRes, which is for comparing results or findings.

Step 3: Selecting the specific class. The example given for CoCoRes is similar: comparing results obtained in the present work with those of a cited study. Since the passage here is directly contrasting their results with the cited experiments, the correct label should be CoCoRes.
