Okay, let's start by looking at the passage provided. The citation is mentioned in the sentence: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The key part here is that the authors are referring to the experimental setup being described in a previous work. 

Next, determining the general intent. The phrase "was described in detail previously" suggests that the cited work is providing a method or procedure that the current study is using. This points towards a technical reference, as they are directly using the setup from the cited paper.

Looking at the rhetorical classes, the Usage class is for when a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup from the cited work is directly used. The example given in the Usage definition matches this scenario exactly: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." 

Comparing this with other classes like Support or Basis, Support is for confirming results, and Basis is about foundational work. Here, it's specifically about the experimental setup being used, which fits Usage best. There's no indication of comparison, criticism, or motivation here. 

Therefore, the correct rhetorical class should be Usage.
