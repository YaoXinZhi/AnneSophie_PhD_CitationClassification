Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. The task is to determine the rhetorical class of the citation marked @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage provided is:

"@@CITATION@@ reported the first detection of the citrus canker pathogen, Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri, in Florida. This finding prompted immediate regulatory actions to contain the spread of the disease."

So the context here is that the cited work reported the first detection of a specific pathogen in Florida, which led to regulatory actions.

Next, I need to identify the general intent of the citation. The citation is being used to reference the initial detection of the pathogen. This seems foundational because it's establishing the origin of the problem or the starting point for subsequent actions. The mention of "first detection" suggests that this work is the basis upon which the current research or discussion is built. 

Looking at the options, Basis is for when the citation references the intellectual foundation. Here, the first detection report is likely the foundation for the current study's context or the regulatory responses discussed. There's no comparison with other works, support of results, or criticism. It's more about establishing the origin, which aligns with Basis.

So the specific rhetorical class should be Basis.
