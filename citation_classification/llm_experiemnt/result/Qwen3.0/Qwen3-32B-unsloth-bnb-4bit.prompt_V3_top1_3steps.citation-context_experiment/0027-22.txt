Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user provided a citation in a scientific passage about plant health, and I need to classify it into one of the rhetorical classes. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage says: "The causal relationship between the phytoplasma infection and the symptoms has been established in several studies (Smith et al., 2020; @@CITATION@@; Jones et al., 2021)." The citation here is part of a list of references that support the established causal relationship.

Next, identify the general intent. The sentence is stating that multiple studies have confirmed the causal relationship. The citation is being used to back up this claim, so it's a supportive reference. The authors are using prior work to confirm their point, which aligns with the "Support" category. 

Looking at the examples for Support, they mention that the citation supports or confirms the work of the citing authors. In this case, the cited work is part of the evidence that the causal relationship is established. There's no comparison here, no motivation, just supporting the current statement with existing research. 

So the specific rhetorical class should be Support.
