Okay, let's tackle this citation classification problem. First, I need to look at the context provided around the @@CITATION@@. The passage says, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." 

So, the key part here is that the authors are comparing their results with those from the cited study. They mention that their results are "substantially different" from the cited experiments. 

Looking at the steps, the first thing is to extract the context. The relevant part is the comparison of results between the current work and the cited paper. 

Next, identifying the general intent. Since they're comparing their results directly with the cited work, this falls under the "Comparative" category, which includes CoCoRes. The example given for CoCoRes is exactly similar—comparing results.

Now, selecting the specific rhetorical class. The example provided for CoCoRes states that the citation is used to directly compare results. Here, the authors are doing just that—they're pointing out a substantial difference in results. Therefore, the correct class here should be CoCoRes.
