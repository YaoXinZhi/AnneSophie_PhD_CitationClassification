Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. The user provided a passage with a citation tagged as @@CITATION@@ and wants me to assign the correct rhetorical class from the given list.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." 

Looking at this, the key part is "substantially differ from the results of the experiments..." which indicates a direct comparison between the current study's results and those from the cited work. 

Next, identifying the general intent. Since the citation is contrasting results, this falls under the "Comparative" category. Now, checking the specific rhetorical classes under Comparative: CoCoRes is for comparing results. The example given for CoCoRes mentions differing results, which matches the context here. The cited work's results are being compared directly with the current study's findings.

So the correct class here should be CoCoRes.
