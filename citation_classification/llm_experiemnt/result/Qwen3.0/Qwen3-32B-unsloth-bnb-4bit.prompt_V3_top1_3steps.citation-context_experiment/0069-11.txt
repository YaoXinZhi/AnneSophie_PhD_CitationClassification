Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation here. The passage is about plant health, specifically mentioning a study by Wei et al., 2004 and Saracco et al., 2006 regarding 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' strains in daisy plants. The citation in question is @@CITATION@@ referring to conflicting results described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The sentence says that conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima according to the citation. The prior part mentions studies reporting high concentrations in daisies. So the author is contrasting different studies' findings here.

Looking at the intent: the citation is being used to point out conflicting results between two studies (Wei et al. and Saracco et al.) versus another study (the one cited here). The example given for CoCoXY involves comparing two cited studies with each other, not the current paper. Since the author is highlighting conflicting results between the mentioned studies, this fits CoCoXY, which is about comparing explanations or claims between cited works. The current paper isn't directly compared here; it's about contrasting the cited studies themselves. So the correct class should be CoCoXY.
