Okay, let's start by looking at the passage provided. The user wants me to classify the rhetorical class of the citation at @@CITATION@@. 

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The sentence is: "The presence of these symptoms is consistent with those described for the same disease in other regions @@CITATION@@." The key part here is that the authors are saying their findings are consistent with what was previously described in another study.

Next, I need to determine the general intent. When a paper refers to another study's results and says their own results are consistent, that's usually to support their own findings with existing literature. The intent here seems supportive because they're aligning their results with prior work to validate their observations.

Now, looking at the specific rhetorical classes. The Support class is for when the citation is used to support or confirm the work, results, or findings of the citing authors. The example given for Support mentions consistency with previous research, which matches the scenario here. The authors are using the cited work to back up their own observations. 

Other possibilities might be Similar, but Similar is more about pointing out similarities between the cited work and the current paper, not necessarily supporting their findings. Since the focus here is on consistency (support) rather than just noting a similarity, Support is more appropriate. There's no comparison of results or methods here, so CoCoRes or CoCoGM don't fit. Also, there's no criticism or weakness mentioned. 

Therefore, the correct rhetorical class should be Support.
