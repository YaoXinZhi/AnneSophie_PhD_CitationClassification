Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. First, I need to look at the context around the citation. The passage says, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." 

So, the key part here is comparing the results of the current work with those from the cited study. The phrase "substantially differ" indicates a direct comparison of findings. 

Looking at the intent, this is about contrasting results, which falls under the Comparative category. Now, among the fine-grained classes, CoCoRes is specifically for comparing results or findings. The example given in the guidelines matches this scenario where the current work's results are compared with a previous study's results.

Therefore, the correct rhetorical class here should be CoCoRes.
