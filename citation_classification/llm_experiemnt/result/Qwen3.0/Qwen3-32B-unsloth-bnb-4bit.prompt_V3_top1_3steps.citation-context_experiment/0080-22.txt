Okay, let's tackle this citation classification step by step. First, I need to look at the given passage and identify the context around the @@CITATION@@. The passage is about the use of magnetic water treatment devices in the USA since 1975, with the citation mentioned in a straightforward way without any supporting arguments or comparisons. 

Next, I'll extract the relevant context. The sentence states the fact of their use spreading since a specific year and cites the source. There's no indication of supporting evidence, criticism, comparison with other studies, or motivation for current research. It's just a factual statement with a reference.

Now, determining the general intent. The citation here is used neutrally to provide a reference for the stated fact without adding any argumentative purpose. The example given under 'Neutral' in the definitions matches this scenario, where the citation is descriptive without supporting, comparing, criticizing, or motivating.

Finally, selecting the specific rhetorical class. Since there's no comparison, support, criticism, or motivation involved, the most appropriate label is 'Neutral'.
