Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. The task is to determine the rhetorical class of the citation in the given passage. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." 

So the key part here is that the authors are comparing their results to those from previous experiments mentioned in the cited work. The phrase "substantially differ" indicates a direct comparison of results. 

Next, looking at the general intent. Since they are contrasting their findings with those of the cited study, this falls under the Comparative category. The specific type of comparison here is about the results themselves, not methods or goals. 

Now, checking the predefined classes, CoCoRes is for comparing results. The example given in the instructions matches this scenario exactly, where the results of the current work are compared to the cited experiments. 

Therefore, the correct rhetorical class here is CoCoRes.
