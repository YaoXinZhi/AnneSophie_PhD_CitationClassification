Okay, let's start by looking at the passage provided. The citation is in the sentence: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The key part here is "described in detail previously," which indicates that the cited work is where the setup was originally detailed.

Next, identifying the general intent. The authors are referring to a prior description of the experimental setup. This doesn't seem to be about comparing results, methods, or goals. They're not supporting their current findings with this citation either. Instead, they're pointing out that the setup was already described in a previous study. 

Looking at the definitions, the 'Usage' class is for when a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup from the cited work is directly used. In this case, the setup from the cited work is being referenced as the basis for their current experiment. However, the example given for 'Usage' specifically mentions the experimental setup being described in detail previously. The example matches closely with the current case. 

Wait, but 'Usage' is about using a method or setup from the cited work. Here, the authors are citing where the setup was described, implying they are using that setup in their own study. So this fits the 'Usage' class because they are directly using the experimental setup from the cited work. 

Alternatively, could it be 'Basis'? The Basis class is for foundational references. But in the example for Basis, they talk about introducing and validating a method. Here, it's about describing the setup previously. The key difference is that 'Usage' refers to employing a method/tool, while 'Basis' is about foundational work. Since the citation here is about where the setup was detailed, and they are using it, it's more about usage. 

Therefore, the correct class should be 'Usage'.
