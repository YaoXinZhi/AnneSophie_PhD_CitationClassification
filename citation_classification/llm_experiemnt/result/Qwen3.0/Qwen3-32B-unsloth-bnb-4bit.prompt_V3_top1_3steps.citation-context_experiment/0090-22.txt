Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. The task is to determine the rhetorical class of the given citation in the context provided.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage is: "The effectiveness of biological control agents against plant pathogens has been widely studied. For instance, the use of Trichoderma species as antagonists of fungal pathogens is well-documented @@CITATION@@."

So the citation here is referencing the well-documented use of Trichoderma species. The context is about the effectiveness of biological control agents, specifically mentioning Trichoderma against fungal pathogens. The phrase "is well-documented" suggests that the cited work provides supporting evidence or confirmation of this use.

Next, identify the general intent. The citation is used to support the statement that Trichoderma's use is well-documented. The authors are citing previous research to back up their claim, which aligns with a supportive intent. Looking at the definitions, "Support" is when the citation is used to support or confirm the work, results, or findings of the citing authors. The example given for Support mentions that the citation confirms the authors' findings, similar to how this citation is used here to confirm that Trichoderma's effectiveness is documented.

Now, checking the specific rhetorical classes under Supportive. The options are Support and Similar. Since the citation here is providing evidence that the use is well-documented, it's supporting the claim rather than pointing out a similarity. The example for Support uses "also using a U.S. sample," which is similar in that the citation here supports the assertion about documentation. Therefore, the correct class should be Support.
