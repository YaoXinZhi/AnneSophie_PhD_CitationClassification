Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in the given passage. The passage is:

"The role of phytoplasma in plant disease symptoms is well established, with various studies demonstrating their involvement in stunted growth, phyllody, and other abnormalities. However, recent research has shown conflicting results regarding the mechanisms by which phytoplasma induce these symptoms @@CITATION@@."

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The sentence before the citation talks about conflicting results in recent research on phytoplasma mechanisms. The citation is placed at the end of that sentence.

Next, the general intent here seems to be pointing out conflicting findings in the cited work. The authors are mentioning that there's disagreement or differing results in the recent studies they're citing. According to the definitions, if the citation is comparing conflicting results between studies, it might fall under CoCoXY. The example given for CoCoXY mentions conflicting results between two cited studies. The example provided is about conflicting results in a branch-inducing phytoplasma study. 

In the current case, the authors are referencing conflicting results from recent research, which suggests they're comparing different studies' findings, not necessarily their own results or methods. Since the citation is used to highlight conflicting explanations or claims between studies, CoCoXY seems appropriate here. It's not about supporting their own work (Support) or motivating their research (Motivation), but rather pointing out existing conflicting results in the literature. Therefore, the correct class should be CoCoXY.
