Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user provided a passage with a citation and wants me to classify it into one of the given rhetorical classes. 

First, I need to look at the context around the citation. The passage says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." 

So the key part here is "substantially differ from the results..." which indicates they're comparing their results to those from the cited work. According to the step-by-step instructions, when the citation is used to directly compare or contrast results, the class is CoCoRes. 

Looking at the example given for CoCoRes, it's similar: comparing results of the current work with those from another study. There's no mention of goals or methods here, just the results. Also, it's not a neutral statement or a criticism. The intent is to show a direct contrast in findings. So the correct class should be CoCoRes.
