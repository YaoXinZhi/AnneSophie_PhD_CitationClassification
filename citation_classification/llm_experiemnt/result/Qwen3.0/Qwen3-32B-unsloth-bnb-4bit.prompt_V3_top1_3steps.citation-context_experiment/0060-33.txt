Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to look at the context around the citation in the given passage. The user provided a scientific article passage with a citation tag. The task is to classify the rhetorical role of that citation into one of the predefined categories.

Looking at the example passage: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." 

Step 1 is to extract the relevant context. The key part here is that the authors are comparing their results ("the results obtained in the present work") with those from another study ("the results of the experiments conducted... @@CITATION@@"). The phrase "substantially differ" indicates a direct comparison between the two sets of results.

Step 2 is identifying the general intent. The citation is being used to contrast the results of the current study with a previous one. According to the definitions, when the citation is about comparing results, it falls under CoCoRes (Comparison of Results). 

Step 3 is selecting the specific label. The example given for CoCoRes is similar: the authors mention their results differ from those in the cited work. This matches the CoCoRes category because it's a direct comparison of findings between the two studies. There's no mention of methods, goals, or explanations here, so CoCoGM or CoCoXY aren't applicable. It's not supporting or similar findings either, so Support or Similar are out. The citation isn't being used to criticize or point out weaknesses, so Weakness isn't right. It's not foundational or motivational either. Therefore, the correct label should be CoCoRes.
