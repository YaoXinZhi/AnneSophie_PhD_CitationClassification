Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. First, I need to look at the context around the citation. The passage says, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." 

So the key part here is comparing the current results with those from a previous study. The phrase "substantially differ" indicates a direct comparison of results. According to the definitions provided, when a citation is used to compare or contrast results, the appropriate class is CoCoRes. 

The example given for CoCoRes matches this scenario exactly, where the current work's results are compared with those cited. There's no mention of methods, goals, or explanations here, so it's not CoCoGM or CoCoXY. It's not supporting or motivating either. Therefore, the correct label here should be CoCoRes.
