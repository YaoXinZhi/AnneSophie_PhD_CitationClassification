Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation tagged here. The passage is about plant health, right? So the user provided a specific example where the citation is mentioned in the context of comparing results between two studies. Let me break this down.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The sentence says, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." 

So the key part here is that they're comparing their results to the cited work's results. The phrase "substantially differ" indicates a direct comparison of findings. According to the definitions, when the citation is used to compare or contrast results, it's CoCoRes. 

Looking at the examples given for CoCoRes, the example provided matches this scenario exactly. They mention differing results from a cited study. There's no mention of methods or goals here, just the results. Also, it's not a comparison between two other studies (which would be CoCoXY), because the focus is on the current work versus the cited one. 

So the intent here is to compare results, which falls under CoCoRes. I don't see any other factors like motivation, support, or weakness here. The citation isn't being used to support their own findings, nor are they criticizing the cited work. It's purely a comparison of outcomes. Therefore, the correct class should be CoCoRes.
