Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to look at the citation passage provided. The user hasn't included the specific text here, but based on the example given earlier, I can infer that the process involves analyzing the context around the @@CITATION@@ tag.

Assuming the passage is something like "The experimental setup was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@", the first step is to extract the context. The key part here is "described in detail previously," which indicates that the cited work is providing the method or setup used in the current study.

Next, identifying the general intent. Since the citation refers to a method or experimental setup that's directly used in the current research, this falls under the Technical category. The specific rhetorical class here would be "Usage" because the cited work's method or tool is being utilized in the current study.

Looking at the examples provided for "Usage," the example mentions an experimental set-up described previously. The context here matches that example, where the citation is pointing to a method or setup directly used. Therefore, the correct label should be "Usage."
