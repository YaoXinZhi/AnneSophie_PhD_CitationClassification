Okay, let's tackle this classification task step by step. The passage given is:

"@@CITATION@@ demonstrated the effectiveness of a new method for early detection of plant pathogens using spectral analysis. Building on this approach, we developed an enhanced protocol that incorporates machine learning algorithms to improve accuracy."

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The key part is "demonstrated the effectiveness of a new method..." which shows that the cited work introduced a method that the current research is building upon.

Next, determining the intent. The phrase "Building on this approach" indicates that the current study is extending or improving upon the cited work's method. This suggests a foundational role since the cited work provides the basis for the current research.

Looking at the rhetorical classes, "Basis" is for when the citation is the intellectual foundation. The example given for Basis mentions replicating results and building upon them, which aligns with this case. The cited work's method is the foundation that the current study enhances with machine learning. There's no direct comparison here, so CoCoGM or CoCoRes don't fit. It's not a motivation or future work either. The citation isn't being used to support a claim but rather to establish the foundation. Therefore, the correct class should be Basis.
