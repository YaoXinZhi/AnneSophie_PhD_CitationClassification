Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The task is to determine the rhetorical class of the citation in the given passage. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage is: "In recent studies, the effectiveness of biocontrol agents against phytoplasma infections has been explored. For instance, @@CITATION@@ demonstrated that certain bacterial strains could reduce phytoplasma titers in host plants." 

So the context is about biocontrol agents' effectiveness, and the citation is used to show that a study demonstrated bacterial strains reducing phytoplasma titers.

Next, identify the general intent. The phrase "demonstrated that..." suggests that the cited work supports the current discussion. The authors are using this citation to back up their point about biocontrol agents being effective. That leans towards a Supportive intent because they're confirming their findings with previous research.

Now, looking at the specific classes under Supportive, which are Support and Similar. The example for Support says the citation supports or confirms the work of the citing authors. Here, the citation is providing evidence that supports the claim about biocontrol agents' effectiveness. The example for Similar is when there's a similarity in results or observations. In this case, the citation is not just pointing out similarity but is used to support the current assertion. 

Therefore, the correct class here is Support.
