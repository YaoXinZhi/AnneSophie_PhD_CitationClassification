Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. The task is to determine the rhetorical class of the given citation in the context of a plant health scientific article. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage provided is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." 

So the citation here is being used to compare the results of the current study with those from a previous experiment that used deuterium-saturated metal targets. The key phrase here is "substantially differ from the results," which indicates a direct comparison between the findings of the current work and the cited study.

Next, I need to identify the general intent. Since the authors are contrasting their results with those of the cited work, this falls under the Comparative category. The specific type of comparison here is about the results themselves, not the methods, goals, or explanations. The example given for CoCoRes mentions comparing results, which aligns with this scenario.

Looking at the options, CoCoRes is defined as comparing or contrasting results or findings. The example provided in the guidelines is very similar: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments... @@CITATION@." This matches exactly with the structure of the given passage. 

Therefore, the most appropriate rhetorical class here is CoCoRes.
