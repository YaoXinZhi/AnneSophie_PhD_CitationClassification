Okay, let's tackle this classification problem step by step. The task is to determine the rhetorical class of the citation marked @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." 

So the context here is that the current work's results are being compared as substantially different from another study's results. The key phrase here is "substantially differ from the results of the experiments..." which directly points to a comparison of results between the current paper and the cited work.

Next, identifying the general intent. The authors are contrasting their findings with those from the cited study. This falls under the "Comparative" category, specifically comparing results. Looking at the predefined classes, CoCoRes is for direct comparison of results or findings. The example given for CoCoRes mentions differing results from a cited work, which matches the context here.

Now, selecting the specific rhetorical class. Since the citation is used to highlight a difference in results between the current study and the cited one, the correct label should be CoCoRes. There's no mention of goals, methods, or explanations here, so CoCoGM or CoCoXY are out. It's not supporting, motivating, or a basis either. The comparison is direct and about results, so CoCoRes fits perfectly.
