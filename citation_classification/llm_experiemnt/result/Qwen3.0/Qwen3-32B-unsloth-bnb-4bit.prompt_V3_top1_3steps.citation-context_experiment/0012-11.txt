Okay, let's see. I need to classify the citation in the given passage. First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions that the results are consistent with recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria, specifically citing the work on fleas and ticks. The example given is about how the arthropod host governs bacterial assemblages. 

So the intent here seems to be pointing out a similarity between their findings and the cited work. Both studies observed that the host (insect in the current paper, fleas and ticks in the cited one) influence bacterial communities. The key phrase is "supported by recent cross-taxon investigations," which suggests they're highlighting a similar pattern.

Looking at the rhetorical classes, 'Similar' is used when the cited work shows a similarity in results or observations. The example provided in the guidelines matches this scenario where the current finding is similar to a previous study. There's no direct comparison of methods or results, just a note of similarity. So the correct class should be 'Similar'.
