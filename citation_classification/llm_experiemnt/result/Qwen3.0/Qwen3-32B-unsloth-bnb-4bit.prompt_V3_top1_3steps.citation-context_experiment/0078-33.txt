Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. The passage given is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The key part here is that the authors are comparing their results with those from previous experiments using specific deuterium-saturated metal targets cited here.

Next, identifying the general intent. The phrase "substantially differ from the results" indicates a direct comparison between the current study's findings and the cited work's results. According to the definitions, when a citation is used to compare results, it falls under CoCoRes. 

Looking at the example for CoCoRes: the example given is similar, where results are compared directly. The user's passage does the same by stating their results differ from the cited experiments. There's no mention of contrasting methods or goals, which would be CoCoGM, nor is it about comparing explanations between two other studies (CoCoXY). The intent here is clearly about the results themselves. 

So the specific rhetorical class here should be CoCoRes.
