Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. First, I need to look at the context around the citation. The passage says, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." 

So the key part here is comparing the current results with those from a previous study. The phrase "substantially differ" indicates a direct comparison of results. According to the definitions provided, CoCoRes is used when the citation is comparing or contrasting results or findings between the cited work and the citing paper. 

The example given for CoCoRes matches this scenario exactly: the authors mention their results differ from those in the cited work. There's no mention of methods or goals, just the results themselves. There's also no indication of supporting, motivating, or critiquing the cited work, just a factual comparison. 

Therefore, the correct rhetorical class here should be CoCoRes.
