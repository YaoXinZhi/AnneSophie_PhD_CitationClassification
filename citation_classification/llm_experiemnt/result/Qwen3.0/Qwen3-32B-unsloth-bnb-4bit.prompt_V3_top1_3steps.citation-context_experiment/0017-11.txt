Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. First, I need to look at the context around the citation. The passage says, "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." The key part here is "described in detail previously," which points to the cited work providing the setup that the current study is using.

Next, identifying the general intent. The authors are referring to a prior description of their experimental setup. This seems like they're using a method or tool that was previously outlined by someone else. According to the definitions, if the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup used in the current study, it falls under the "Usage" category. 

Looking at the examples for Usage, one example is about an experimental set-up being described previously with a citation. That matches exactly what's happening here. The current paper isn't comparing methods, supporting results, or pointing out weaknesses; they're just stating they used a previously described setup. 

So, the most appropriate rhetorical class here is "Usage."
