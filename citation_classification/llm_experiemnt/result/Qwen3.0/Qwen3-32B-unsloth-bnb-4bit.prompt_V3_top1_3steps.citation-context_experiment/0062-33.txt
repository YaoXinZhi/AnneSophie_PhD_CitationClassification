Okay, let's start by looking at the citation passage provided. The user wants me to classify the rhetorical class of the citation tagged @@CITATION@@. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage is: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." The key part here is that the authors are referring to a previous study where the experimental setup was detailed.

Next, I need to determine the general intent. The phrase "was described in detail previously" suggests that the cited work is providing the method or setup that the current study is using. This points towards the citation being used to reference a method or tool from the cited work that is directly used in the current research. 

Looking at the predefined classes, the "Usage" class is defined as referring to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup from the cited work that is directly used in the current study. The example given is very similar: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@" which matches the example in the Usage class description.

So the specific rhetorical class here should be "Usage".
