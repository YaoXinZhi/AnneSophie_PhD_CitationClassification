Okay, let's tackle this citation classification task step by step. First, I need to look at the passage provided and extract the context around the @@CITATION@@. The user mentioned that the citation is in the plant health domain, so I should keep that in mind for any domain-specific terms.

The given passage is: "The effectiveness of biocontrol agents against phytopathogens has been extensively studied. For instance, @@CITATION@@ demonstrated the use of Trichoderma spp. as a successful biocontrol agent against Fusarium wilt in tomato plants."

Step 1: Extracting the context. The sentence around the citation mentions that the cited work demonstrated the use of Trichoderma spp. as a successful biocontrol agent against Fusarium wilt in tomatoes. The key here is that the citation is being used to provide an example of effectiveness in biocontrol agents.

Step 2: Identifying the general intent. The phrase "demonstrated the use of..." suggests that the cited work is supporting the current statement about effectiveness. Since the authors are citing a previous study that shows success in biocontrol, they're using it to back up their own discussion on effectiveness. This seems like a supportive reference.

Looking at the rhetorical classes, Support is when the citation supports or confirms the work of the citing authors. The example given for Support is where subscales were consistent with previous research, which aligns with the current case where the citation is used to support the effectiveness mentioned.

Step 3: Choosing the specific class. Comparing with other options: it's not a Basis because it's not foundational, not a comparison (so CoCo classes don't fit), not Motivation, Future, Similar, Usage, Weakness, or Neutral. The example given in Support fits here because the cited work is used to support the current discussion on effectiveness. Therefore, the correct label is Support.
