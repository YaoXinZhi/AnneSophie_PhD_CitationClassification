Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. First, I need to look at the context around the citation. The passage says, "The use of magnetic water treatment devices to prevent calcite scale formation has been reported since the 1970s @@CITATION@@." 

So, the citation here is mentioned in a historical context about when the use of these devices started being reported. The key part is "has been reported since the 1970s" which is providing background information. There's no comparison here with other studies, no support or criticism, just stating when this practice began. 

Looking at the rhetorical classes, Neutral is for citations used descriptively without any argument. The example given for Neutral mentions something similar about the spread of magnetic water treatment devices since 1975. This matches because the citation here is just giving a historical note without taking a stance or supporting an argument. There's no indication of motivation, future work, or any technical usage either. Therefore, the most appropriate class is Neutral.
