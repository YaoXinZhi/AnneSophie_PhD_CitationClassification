Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user provided a citation passage and wants me to classify it into the correct rhetorical class.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." 

The key part here is comparing the results of the current study with those from the cited work. The phrase "substantially differ" indicates a direct comparison of results. 

Next, looking at the general intent. Since the authors are contrasting their findings with previous experimental results, this falls under comparative intent. The specific category here is comparing results, which according to the definitions, is CoCoRes. 

No other classes like CoCoGM or CoCoXY fit because the comparison is between the citing paper's results and the cited work's results, not methods or explanations. There's no support, motivation, or criticism here either. So the most accurate label is CoCoRes.
