Okay, let's tackle this classification task step by step. First, I need to look at the citation passage provided. The user has given an example where the citation is used in the sentence: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." 

So, the first step is to extract the context around the citation. The key part here is that the current results differ from those in the cited work. The phrase "substantially differ from the results of the experiments" indicates a comparison of results between the current study and the one cited.

Next, I need to determine the general intent. Since the citation is being used to highlight differences in results, this falls under the Comparative category. The specific subclass here would be CoCoRes, which is for comparing or contrasting results or findings. 

Looking at the example provided for CoCoRes, it's very similar: the current work's results differ from previous experiments. The example given in the instructions uses a similar structure, so this matches CoCoRes. There's no mention of methods or goals, just the results, so it's not CoCoGM. Also, it's not a comparison between two cited studies, so not CoCoXY. The intent is to show a contrast in results, so CoCoRes is the right choice.
