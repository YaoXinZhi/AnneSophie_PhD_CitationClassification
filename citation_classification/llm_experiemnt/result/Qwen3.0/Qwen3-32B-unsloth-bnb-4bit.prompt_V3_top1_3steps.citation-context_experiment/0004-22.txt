Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to look at the passage provided and identify the context around the citation. The user mentioned the citation is tagged as @@CITATION@@, so I need to focus on the sentences around that tag.

The passage given is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@."

Step 1 is to extract the context discussing the citation. The key part here is that the authors are comparing their results with those from a previous study that used deuterium-saturated metal targets. The citation here is directly pointing to the results of that experiment.

Moving to Step 2: Identify the general intent. The phrase "substantially differ from the results" indicates a comparison of results between the current work and the cited study. According to the definitions, when comparing results directly, it falls under Comparative â†’ CoCoRes.

Step 3 is selecting the specific rhetorical class. The example given for CoCoRes mentions comparing results, which matches the context here. The authors are contrasting their findings with those from the cited work. Therefore, the correct label should be CoCoRes.
