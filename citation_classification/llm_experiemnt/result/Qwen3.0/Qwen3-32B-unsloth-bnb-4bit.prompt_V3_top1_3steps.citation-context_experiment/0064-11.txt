Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user provided a citation passage where I need to classify the rhetorical role of the citation. The passage is: "The occurrence of 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' in daisy plants was first reported by @@CITATION@@." 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The sentence mentions that the occurrence of a specific phytoplasma strain in daisy plants was first reported by the cited work. The key here is the phrase "first reported," which indicates that the cited work is establishing the initial documentation of this occurrence.

Next, identifying the general intent. Since the citation is pointing out that this was the first report, it's likely providing foundational information. The Basis class is for when the citation references the intellectual foundation or the origin of a concept, method, or finding. Here, the cited work is the origin of the report on this phytoplasma in daisies, so it's a foundational reference.

Looking at the examples for Basis, one example mentions introducing and validating a method, which is similar in that the citation here is introducing the first occurrence. There's no comparison with other works, no support for the current study's results, just establishing the origin. 

CoCoXY involves comparing explanations between studies, but here there's no comparison between two cited studies. CoCoGM or CoCoRes also don't fit because it's not about goals, methods, or results comparison with the current paper. Motivation, Future, Support, Similar, Usage, Weakness, and Neutral are also not applicable here. The Neutral example is about a descriptive citation without argument, but in this case, it's more about establishing the origin, which aligns with Basis.

So the most appropriate class is Basis.
