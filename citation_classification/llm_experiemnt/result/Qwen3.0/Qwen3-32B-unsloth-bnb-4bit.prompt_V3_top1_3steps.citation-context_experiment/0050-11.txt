Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the given citation. The user provided a passage with a citation marked as @@CITATION@@. Let me start by looking at the context around the citation.

The passage is: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." 

So the sentence is saying that the setup was described before, and they're citing a previous work. The key here is that the citation is referring to where the setup was detailed. According to the definitions, if the citation is about using a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup from the cited work directly in the current study, it falls under "Usage". 

In the example given for Usage, it's exactly similar: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@" which matches the example provided. So the intent here is that the current study is using the setup from the cited paper. There's no comparison, support, or motivation hereâ€”it's just a reference to the method or setup used. 

Therefore, the correct class should be "Usage".
