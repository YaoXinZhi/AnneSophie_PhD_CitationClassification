Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. First, I need to look at the context around the citation in the given passage. The passage says: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." 

So the citation here is referring to where the experimental setup was previously described. The key part is "described in detail previously," which indicates that the cited work is the source of the method or setup that the current study is using.

Next, I need to determine the general intent. Since the authors are mentioning that they used a previously described experimental setup, this seems like they are referencing a method or tool from the cited paper. According to the definitions, if the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup that's directly used in the current study, it falls under the "Usage" category. 

Looking at the example provided for "Usage": "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." That's almost exactly the same as the given passage. The example is from the Usage class, so this strongly suggests that the correct classification here is "Usage."

I should check the other options to be sure. It's not a basis because they're not establishing a foundational reference. It's not a comparison or support. The context is straightforward about using a previously described setup, so "Usage" is the most accurate label here.
