Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. The task is to determine the rhetorical class of the citation in the given passage. 

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage says: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." The key part here is that the authors are referring to a prior description of their experimental setup.

Next, I need to figure out the intent. They're not comparing results, methods, or goals with another study. They're not supporting their current findings with this citation either. Instead, they're indicating that the setup was already detailed in a previous work. This points to the use of a method or tool from the cited paper. 

Looking at the definitions, the Usage class is for when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup used in the current study. Since the setup was described in the cited work, this fits the Usage category. There's no criticism, support, or comparison happening here. It's a direct reference to prior work that provided the setup they're using now. 

So the most appropriate label here is Usage.
