Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. The task is to determine the rhetorical class of the citation tagged @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage is: "The impact of climate change on plant health has been increasingly studied. @@CITATION@@ reported significant shifts in pest distributions due to rising temperatures."

So the context here is that the authors are discussing how climate change affects plant health, specifically mentioning that the cited work reported shifts in pest distributions because of rising temperatures. 

Next, I need to figure out the general intent of the citation. The phrase "reported significant shifts..." suggests that the cited work's findings are being referenced. The citing paper is using this citation to support their own discussion about climate change's impact. Since they're mentioning the results of the cited study (shifts in pest distributions) in the context of their own topic (climate change and plant health), it seems like they're using the citation to back up their point. 

Looking at the options, Support is when the citation is used to support or confirm the work, results, or findings of the citing authors. The example given for Support mentions that the subscales were consistent with previous research, which aligns with how this citation is used here. The authors are pointing to the cited study's results to support their discussion about climate change's effects. There's no comparison here, no criticism, no motivation for future work, just supporting their current argument with existing findings. 

Therefore, the most appropriate class here is Support.
