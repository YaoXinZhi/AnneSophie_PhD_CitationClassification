Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. The user provided a passage where a citation is mentioned, and I need to determine which rhetorical class it belongs to.

First, I'll look at the context around the citation. The sentence is: "The presence of phytoplasmas in the xylem vessels of infected plants has been reported previously @@CITATION@@." The key part here is that the citation is referring to prior reports of phytoplasmas in xylem vessels. 

Next, I need to figure out the intent. The authors are mentioning that this presence has been reported before, so they're not introducing a new finding but rather acknowledging previous work that supports their current research. The citation here is used to back up the claim that this observation isn't new. 

Looking at the options, "Support" seems likely because they're confirming their finding with prior research. The example given for Support mentions that the citation supports the work or results of the citing authors. In this case, the citation supports the statement by showing that previous studies have already documented this presence. 

I should check other possibilities. Is it "Basis"? Basis is more about foundational work that the current research builds upon. Here, it's about supporting a specific claim rather than establishing the foundation. "CoCo" classes involve comparisons, which aren't present here. "Motivation" would be if the citation is pointing out a gap or need, which isn't the case. "Neutral" is for descriptive use without support, but here the citation is used to support their statement. 

Therefore, the most accurate class here is "Support".
