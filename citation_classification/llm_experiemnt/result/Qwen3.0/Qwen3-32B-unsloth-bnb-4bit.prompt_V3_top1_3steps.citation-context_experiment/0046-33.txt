Okay, let me tackle this classification step by step. First, I need to look at the context around the citation in the given passage. The passage says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@."

So, the key part here is that the authors are comparing their results ("The results obtained in the present work") with those from previous experiments mentioned in the citation. The phrase "substantially differ" indicates a direct comparison of findings. 

Next, I need to determine the general intent. Since they're contrasting their results with those cited, this falls under the Comparative category. The specific subclass here would be CoCoRes, which is for comparing results or findings between the current work and the cited work. 

Looking at the examples provided for CoCoRes, the example given is almost identical in structure to the passage here. The example mentions differing results from a cited work, just like in our case. There's no mention of comparing methods or goals, and it's not a comparison between two cited studies, so CoCoRes is the right fit here. 

I should make sure it's not CoCoGM or CoCoXY. CoCoGM would involve comparing goals or methods, which isn't happening here. CoCoXY is for comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies, which also doesn't apply. The citation here is about the results of the cited work versus the current work. 

Therefore, the correct label is CoCoRes.
