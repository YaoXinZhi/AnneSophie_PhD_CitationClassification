Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the rhetorical class of the citation tagged @@CITATION@@ in the given passage.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@."

So the key part here is that the current work's results are "substantially differ" from those in the cited work. The author is directly comparing their results to the ones from the cited study. According to the definitions, when a citation is used to compare or contrast results, it's CoCoRes. 

Looking at the example provided for CoCoRes: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments..." which is exactly the structure here. The example given in the problem matches the example in the guidelines. 

So the intent here is to compare results, which falls under CoCoRes. There's no mention of methods or goals, so it's not CoCoGM. It's a direct comparison of findings, so CoCoRes is the right choice.
