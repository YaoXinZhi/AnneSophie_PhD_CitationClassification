Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The given passage is: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." The citation here is referencing a previous description of the experimental setup.

Next, identifying the general intent. The phrase "was described in detail previously" suggests that the current study is using a setup that's already been outlined in another work. This points towards the citation being used to indicate that a method or tool from the cited work is directly utilized here. 

Looking at the rhetorical classes, "Usage" fits here because the citation refers to a method (experimental setup) from the cited work that the current study is employing. The example provided under "Usage" is similar: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@." So, this aligns perfectly with the "Usage" class.
