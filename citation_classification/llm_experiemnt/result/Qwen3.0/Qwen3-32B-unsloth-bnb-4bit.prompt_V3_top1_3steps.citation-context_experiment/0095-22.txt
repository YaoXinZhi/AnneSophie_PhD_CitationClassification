Okay, let's start by looking at the passage provided. The citation is mentioned in the sentence: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The key part here is that the authors are referring to their previous work where the experimental setup was detailed. The phrase "was described in detail previously" indicates that they are citing their own prior research to show that the setup isn't new in this current study but has been used before.

Next, determining the general intent. The citation is used to reference where the method or setup was first detailed. This points towards a technical use because they are directly using a method from their previous work. According to the definitions, when a citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup from the cited work that is directly used in the current study, it falls under the "Usage" category. 

Looking at the examples provided for "Usage," the example given is: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." This matches exactly with the current case. The authors are citing their previous paper to indicate that the setup they used here was already detailed there. There's no comparison, support, motivation, or criticism hereâ€”it's purely about the usage of a previously established method.

So the specific rhetorical class here should be "Usage."
