Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation here. The passage is:

`The biological control agent Metarhizium anisoplae has been shown to be effective against various insect pests, including locusts @@CITATION@@.`

First, step one is to extract the context around the citation. The sentence says that Metarhizium anisoplae is effective against various insect pests, specifically mentioning locusts, and then cites a source. The context here is about the effectiveness of the biological control agent.

Step two is identifying the general intent. The authors are referencing a previous study that supports their claim about the effectiveness of Metarhizium anisoplae. They're using the citation to back up their statement, so it's a supportive intent. Supportive would fall under the Support or Similar categories. 

Looking at the examples for Support: "All subscales were consistent with previous research, particularly that of @@CITATION@@..." which is similar to this case where the citation supports the current statement. The example for Similar mentions a similarity in findings. Here, the citation is used to support the assertion of effectiveness, not to point out a similarity. 

So the specific rhetorical class here would be Support because the citation is used to confirm the effectiveness mentioned in the citing paper. There's no comparison to other works or criticism, just supporting their claim with prior research.
