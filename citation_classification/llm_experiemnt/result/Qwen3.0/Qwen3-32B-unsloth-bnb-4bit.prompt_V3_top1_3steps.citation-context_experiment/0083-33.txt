Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. The user provided a scientific passage with a citation and wants me to determine the appropriate rhetorical class from the given list.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage is: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@." The key part here is that the citation is referring to where the setup was previously described.

Next, identify the general intent. The phrase "was described in detail previously" suggests that the cited work is the source of the method or setup used in the current study. This points towards the citation being used to reference a method or tool that the current study is utilizing.

Looking at the definitions, the 'Usage' class is for when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup from the cited work that is directly used in the current study. The example given is very similar: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." 

So, comparing the example with the provided passage, it's clear that the intent here is to indicate that the current study is using a setup described in the cited work. There's no comparison, support, motivation, or criticism hereâ€”it's purely about the usage of a previously described method. Therefore, the correct rhetorical class should be 'Usage'.
