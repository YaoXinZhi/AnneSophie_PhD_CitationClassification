Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in the given passage. First, I'll extract the context around the @@CITATION@@. The passage is about a study on phytoplasma strains in daisy plants and conflicting results in another study.

The example given mentions Wei et al., 2004 and Saracco et al., 2006 reporting high concentrations in young leaves and roots, but conflicting results in Euphorbia pulcherrima from the citation. The key here is that they're comparing two different studies' explanations or claims. 

The rhetorical class CoCoXY is for comparing cited studies with each other, not with the current paper. Since the example contrasts two previous studies (the ones by Wei/Saracco and the cited one), this fits CoCoXY. The authors are pointing out conflicting results between the cited works, so it's a comparison of explanations or claims between those studies. Not supporting their own work, not motivating, just contrasting the cited ones. So the correct class should be CoCoXY.
