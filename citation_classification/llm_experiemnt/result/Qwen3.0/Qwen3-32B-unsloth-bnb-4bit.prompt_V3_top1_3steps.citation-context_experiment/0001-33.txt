Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage says, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." 

Looking at this, the key part is "substantially differ from the results of..." which indicates a direct comparison between the current study's results and those cited. 

Next, determining the general intent. Since the authors are contrasting their findings with previous results, this falls under comparative intent. Now, among the comparative classes, the example for CoCoRes mentions comparing results or findings. The example given is about differing results between the current work and a cited study, which matches the structure here. 

The citation here isn't comparing goals or methods (CoCoGM) nor is it comparing two other studies (CoCoXY). It's a direct result comparison. So the specific class should be CoCoRes.
