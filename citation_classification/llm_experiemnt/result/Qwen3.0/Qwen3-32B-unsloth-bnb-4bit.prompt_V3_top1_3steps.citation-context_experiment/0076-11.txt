Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the given citation. The passage is about plant health, specifically dealing with pathogen transmission. The citation is mentioned in the context of a study that found certain bacteria in a specific location. The authors are contrasting their findings with those of the cited work, which reported conflicting results in a different plant species.

First, extract the context around the citation. The sentence says there were conflicting results described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima, citing the reference. The example given in the definitions mentions CoCoXY when comparing two cited studies. Here, the authors are pointing out conflicting results between their study and the cited one, which fits the CoCoXY category because it's a comparison between the two studies' explanations or claims. The key here is that the citation is used to highlight conflicting results, not comparing with their own work directly. So the correct class should be CoCoXY.
