Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. The user provided a passage with a citation tagged as @@CITATION@@, and I need to determine the correct rhetorical class from the given list.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." 

Now, looking at the intent here, the author is directly comparing their results with those from the cited study. The key phrase is "substantially differ from the results," which indicates a comparison of findings. According to the definitions, CoCoRes is used when comparing results or findings between the citing paper and the cited work. 

Checking the example for CoCoRes: the example given is very similar, where results are compared. The user's passage matches this scenario because they're contrasting their results with those from the cited experiments. There's no mention of methods, goals, or explanations, so CoCoGM or CoCoXY don't fit. It's a direct result comparison, so CoCoRes is the right choice.
