Okay, let me try to figure out the rhetorical class for this citation. First, I need to look at the context around the @@CITATION@@ in the passage provided. 

The passage says: "In a study on plant-pathogen interactions, the role of specific genes was examined. @@CITATION@@ reported that these genes are crucial for resistance mechanisms in certain crops." 

So the context is about plant-pathogen interactions and the role of specific genes in resistance. The citation is mentioned as having reported that these genes are crucial for resistance mechanisms in certain crops.

Step 1: Extracting the context. The key part is that the cited work reported the importance of specific genes for resistance in crops. The citing paper is discussing their own study on plant-pathogen interactions and the role of genes.

Step 2: Identifying the general intent. The citation here is being used to support the claim that these genes are important. The citing authors are referencing the previous study to back up their own discussion or findings. So it's a supportive reference, confirming their point with existing research.

Looking at the categories, Support is when the citation supports the work, results, or findings of the citing authors. The example given for Support mentions consistency with previous research. Here, the citation is providing evidence that the genes are crucial, which supports the citing authors' discussion. 

Alternatively, could it be Similar? Similar is when there's a similarity between the cited work and the citing paper. But in this case, it's more about supporting the claim rather than pointing out a similarity in results or patterns. The example for Similar mentions a finding supported by recent studies, but here it's about the genes being crucial, which the authors are using to support their own context. 

So the correct class here is Support.
