Okay, let's tackle this classification task step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The given passage is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." 

So the context is about comparing the results of the current study with those from experiments using specific deuterium-saturated metal targets cited in the reference. The key phrase here is "substantially differ from the results of the experiments," which directly points to a comparison of findings.

Next, identifying the general intent. The authors are contrasting their results with those previously published. According to the definitions, when the citation is used to compare or contrast results or findings, the intent falls under Comparative, specifically CoCoRes. 

Looking at the example for CoCoRes: the example given is similar in structure, where results are directly compared. The current example matches this by stating their results differ from those in the cited work. 

No other classes seem to fit here. It's not a basis because it's not foundational, nor is it a motivation or support. The comparison is direct and about results, so CoCoRes is the correct label.
