Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user wants me to classify the citation in the given passage into one of the specified rhetorical classes. Let me start by looking at the passage they provided.

The passage is: "The development of resistant crop varieties has been a cornerstone in managing plant diseases. For instance, @@CITATION@@ demonstrated the effectiveness of incorporating resistance genes into wheat to combat stem rust, a strategy that has since been widely adopted."

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The sentence mentions that resistant crop varieties are a cornerstone in managing plant diseases. Then, the citation is used to provide an example of this, specifically showing how resistance genes were incorporated into wheat against stem rust, and that this strategy is widely used now.

Next, I need to determine the general intent. The citation here is supporting the idea that developing resistant varieties is effective. The authors are using this citation to back up their statement about resistant crops being a key method. So the intent is supportive—they're confirming their point with an example from previous research.

Now, looking at the options, Support is the class where the citation is used to support or confirm the work of the citing authors. The example given in the Support class shows that the citation is used to corroborate their findings with previous research. In this case, the citation supports the claim that resistant varieties are effective by providing a specific instance where this was done successfully.

I should check if any other classes might fit. Could it be Basis? Basis is more about the intellectual foundation, but here it's an example supporting a statement rather than laying the groundwork. CoCo classes involve comparisons, which aren't present here. Motivation would be about justifying why the research is needed, but this is more about supporting an existing approach. Future is about suggesting future work, which isn't the case. Usage refers to methods used, which isn't it. Weakness or Neutral don't fit because there's no criticism or neutrality here—it's a positive example. So Support seems right.
