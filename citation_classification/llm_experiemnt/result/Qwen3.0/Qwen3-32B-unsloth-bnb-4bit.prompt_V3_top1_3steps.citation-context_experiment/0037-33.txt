Okay, let's start by looking at the passage provided. The user wants me to classify the rhetorical class of the citation at @@CITATION@@. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@."

So the key part here is that the current work's results are "substantially differ" from previous experiments mentioned in the citation. The author is directly comparing their findings with those from the cited study. 

Next, I need to determine the general intent. The phrase "substantially differ" indicates a comparison of results. According to the step-by-step guide, when the citation is used to compare or contrast results or findings, it falls under CoCoRes. 

Looking at the example given for CoCoRes, it's very similar: comparing results obtained in the present work with those from a cited experiment. The example uses "substantially differ from the results of..." which matches the structure here. 

So the specific rhetorical class here should be CoCoRes because the citation is used to compare the results of the current study with those of the cited work.
