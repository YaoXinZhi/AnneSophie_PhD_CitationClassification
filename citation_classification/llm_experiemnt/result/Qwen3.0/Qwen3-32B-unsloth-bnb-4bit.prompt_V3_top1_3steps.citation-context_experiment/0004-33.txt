Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user provided a citation passage and wants me to classify it into one of the given rhetorical classes. 

First, I need to extract the context around the @@CITATION@@. The passage is: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." So the key part here is that the setup was described in a previous work cited here.

Next, identify the general intent. The phrase "described in detail previously" suggests that the current study is referencing a prior method or setup. Looking at the definitions, the Usage class refers to when a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup from the cited work is directly used. The example given for Usage is about an experimental setup being described in detail previously, which matches this case exactly. 

So the specific rhetorical class here should be Usage because the citation is pointing to where the experimental setup was first detailed, and the current study is using that setup.
