Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user provided a citation in a scientific passage and wants me to classify it into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage is: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." The key part here is that the authors are referring to a previous work where the setup was detailed.

Next, identifying the general intent. The phrase "described in detail previously" suggests that the cited work provides the method or setup that the current study is using. According to the definitions, if the citation is about using a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup from another study, it falls under the "Usage" class. 

Looking at the example for Usage: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." That's almost identical to the example given for the Usage class. The current study is directly using the setup from the cited work. 

So, the specific rhetorical class here is "Usage".
