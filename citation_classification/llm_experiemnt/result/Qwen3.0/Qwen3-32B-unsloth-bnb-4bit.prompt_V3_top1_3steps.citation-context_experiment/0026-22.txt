Okay, let's tackle this classification problem step by step. The user provided a scientific passage with a citation marked as @@CITATION@@, and I need to determine the correct rhetorical class from the given list.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage says: “The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@.” The key part here is that the setup was described "previously" in the cited work.

Next, identifying the intent. The authors are referring to a prior description of their experimental setup. They're not comparing results, methods, or goals with the cited work. Instead, they're indicating that the setup isn't new here but was already detailed in another study. This seems like they're using the cited work as a reference point for their methodology.

Looking at the definitions, the Usage class is for when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup from the cited work that's directly used in the current study. The example given is exactly this scenario: “The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@.” So this matches the Usage category because the cited work's setup is being referenced as the basis for the current study's setup.

No other categories fit here. It's not a Basis because they're not establishing foundational knowledge, but rather referencing a specific method. It's not a Support or Similar either since they're not supporting their claims with the citation or pointing out similarities. Therefore, Usage is the correct label here.
