Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. The task is to determine the rhetorical class of the citation in the given passage. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage provided is: 

"The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@."

The citation here is used to compare the results of the current work with those from the cited experiments. The key phrase is "substantially differ from the results of the experiments," which indicates a direct comparison between the findings of the current study and the cited work. 

Next, identifying the general intent. Since the authors are contrasting their results with those from the cited paper, this falls under the "Comparative" category. The specific type of comparison here is about the results themselves, not methods, goals, or explanations. 

Looking at the predefined classes, CoCoRes is for comparing results. The example given in the problem statement for CoCoRes matches this scenario exactly, where the results are directly compared. 

Therefore, the correct rhetorical class should be CoCoRes.
