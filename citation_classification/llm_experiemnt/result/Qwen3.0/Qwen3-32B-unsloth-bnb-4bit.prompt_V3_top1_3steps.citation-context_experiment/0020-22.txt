Okay, let me tackle this step by step. First, I need to look at the citation passage provided. The user mentioned that the task is to classify the rhetorical class of the citation tagged @@CITATION@@. 

The passage given is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@."

Step 1 is to extract the context around the citation. The key part here is that the current work's results are said to "substantially differ" from previous experiments mentioned in the citation. The citation is referring to experiments with specific deuterium-saturated metal targets.

Step 2 is identifying the general intent. Since the passage is comparing the results of the current work with those of the cited study, this points towards a comparative intent. The specific type of comparison here is about the results themselves, not the methods or goals. 

Looking at the predefined classes, CoCoRes is for comparing results. The example given for CoCoRes mentions differing results between the current work and the cited paper, which matches this case. The words "substantially differ" directly indicate a comparison of results.

Step 3 is selecting the specific class. Since the comparison is between the results of the current study and the cited work, the correct class here should be CoCoRes.
