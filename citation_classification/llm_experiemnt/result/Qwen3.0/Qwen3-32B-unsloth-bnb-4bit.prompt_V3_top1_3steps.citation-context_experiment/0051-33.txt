Okay, let's tackle this classification problem step by step. First, I need to understand the context around the citation in the given passage. The passage says: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." 

So, the key part here is that the authors are referring to their own previous work where the experimental setup was detailed. The phrase "was described in detail previously" suggests that they are citing their own prior research to indicate where the setup was first outlined.

Next, looking at the general intent. The citation is being used to reference a method or experimental setup that's directly used in the current study. According to the definitions provided, the "Usage" class applies when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup from the cited work that is directly used in the current study. 

The example given under "Usage" is very similar: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@" which matches the structure here. The authors are not comparing results, supporting their claims with external validation, or motivating their research with a knowledge gap. They are simply stating that the setup was previously detailed in their own work and is being used again here. 

Therefore, the most appropriate rhetorical class here is "Usage".
