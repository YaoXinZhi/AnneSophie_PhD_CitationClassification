Okay, let's tackle this classification problem step by step. First, I need to look at the citation passage provided. The user mentioned that the citation is tagged with @@CITATION@@, so I should focus on the context around that tag.

The passage is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@."

So, the key part here is that the current results are "substantially differ" from those in the cited work. The author is directly comparing their results with those from the cited study. According to the definitions, CoCoRes is used when the citation is comparing or contrasting results or findings. The example given for CoCoRes mentions differing results between the current work and the cited paper. This matches the context here because the author is pointing out a substantial difference in results. 

I should check other possibilities. Is it a foundational reference (Basis)? No, because it's not about the intellectual foundation. Motivation? Not really, since it's not about justifying the research. Support or Similar? No, because it's contrasting, not supporting or showing similarity. CoCoGM would be about goals or methods, but here it's about results. CoCoXY is comparing two cited studies, but here it's comparing the cited study with the current one. Weakness or Neutral? Doesn't seem to be criticizing or neutral. Future? No. Usage? Not relevant here. 

Therefore, the correct class is CoCoRes.
