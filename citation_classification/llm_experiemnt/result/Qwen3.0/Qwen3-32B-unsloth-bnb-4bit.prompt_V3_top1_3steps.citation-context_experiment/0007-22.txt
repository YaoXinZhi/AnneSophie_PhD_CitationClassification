Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. 

First, I need to look at the context around the citation. The passage says, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." 

So the key part here is comparing the results of the current work with those from the cited study. The phrase "substantially differ from the results" clearly indicates a comparison of findings. 

Next, I check the general intent categories. The options are Foundational, Comparative, Motivational, Supportive, Technical, Critical/Analytical, or Descriptive. Since the citation is contrasting results, this falls under Comparative. 

Now, looking at the specific rhetorical classes under Comparative: CoCoGM (Goals/Methods), CoCoRes (Results), CoCoXY (Explanations/Claims). The example for CoCoRes mentions comparing results directly, which matches the context here. The example given in the instructions is almost identical to the current case. 

Therefore, the correct class should be CoCoRes.
