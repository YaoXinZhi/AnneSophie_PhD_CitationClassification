Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the given citation. The passage is about plant health, specifically mentioning a study on the effects of a virus on plants. The citation is used in the context of comparing results. The authors state that their findings contrast with those of the cited work. The example given in the CoCoRes class mentions comparing results, so this seems to fit. The key words here are "substantially differ from the results," which aligns with CoCoRes.
