Okay, let's tackle this citation classification step by step. First, I need to look at the passage provided and identify the context around the @@CITATION@@. The passage says, "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." 

Now, moving to Step 2: Identifying the general intent. The phrase "described in detail previously" indicates that the authors are referring to a prior work where the setup was already detailed. This doesn't seem to be about comparing methods, supporting their current work with existing results, or pointing out weaknesses. Instead, they're indicating that the setup wasn't newly developed but was used from a previous study. 

Looking at the categories, the Usage class is defined as when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup from the cited work that is directly used in the current study. The example given is "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@", which matches exactly with the passage here. 

So the key here is that the citation is being used to reference where the setup was previously described, meaning the current study is using that setup. Therefore, the rhetorical class should be Usage.
