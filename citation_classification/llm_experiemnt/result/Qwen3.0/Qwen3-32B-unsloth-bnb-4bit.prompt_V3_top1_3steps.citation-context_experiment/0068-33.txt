Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. The passage provided is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The key part here is comparing the current results with those from previous experiments using specific metal targets. The author is pointing out a substantial difference between their findings and the cited work's results.

Next, identifying the general intent. The phrase "substantially differ from the results" indicates a direct comparison of findings. According to the definitions, this falls under Comparative intent, specifically comparing results. 

Now, looking at the fined-grained classes, CoCoRes is for comparing results or findings. The example given in the guidelines matches this scenario where the current work's results are contrasted with those from the cited paper. There's no mention of methods or goals here, so CoCoRes is the right fit. The other options like CoCoGM or CoCoXY don't apply because the comparison is between the current study and the cited work's results, not their methods or explanations. 

Therefore, the correct label should be CoCoRes.
