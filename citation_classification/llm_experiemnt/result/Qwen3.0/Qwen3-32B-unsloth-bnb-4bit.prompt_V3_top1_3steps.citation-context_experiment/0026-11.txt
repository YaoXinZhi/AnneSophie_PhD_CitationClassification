Okay, let's tackle this citation classification. First, I need to look at the passage provided and extract the context around the @@CITATION@@. The passage is about plant pathogenic bacteria and their transmission. The sentence says, "Plant pathogenic bacteria are transmitted to new hosts by a variety of vectors including insects, nematodes, fungi, and even man @@CITATION@@." 

So the context here is that the citation is providing examples of vectors for plant pathogenic bacteria. The author is listing different vectors like insects, nematodes, fungi, and humans. The citation is used here to support the statement that these are the vectors. 

Next step is to determine the general intent. The author isn't comparing methods or results with another study, nor is there a critique or motivation mentioned. The citation seems to be supporting the claim that these vectors exist by referencing a source that lists them. The example given for the Support class mentions that a citation is used to confirm the work or findings. 

In this case, the citation is supporting the statement about vectors by providing a reference that likely lists these vectors. The example provided in the Support class is similar because it refers to previous research that confirms the findings. Therefore, the rhetorical class here should be Support.
