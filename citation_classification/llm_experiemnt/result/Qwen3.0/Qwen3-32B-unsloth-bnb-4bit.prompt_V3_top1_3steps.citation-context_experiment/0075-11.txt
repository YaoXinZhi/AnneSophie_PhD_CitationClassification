Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. The citation is in the passage provided. First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The sentence says, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." 

So, the key part here is that the current study's results are being compared to those from another study using different metal targets. The phrase "substantially differ" indicates a direct comparison of results. According to the definitions, CoCoRes is when the citation is used to compare or contrast the results or findings of the cited work with the citing paper. The example given in the instructions matches this scenario exactly. 

Looking at the other options, Basis doesn't fit because it's not about foundational work. CoCoGM is about goals or methods, which isn't the case here. Motivation, Future, Support, Similar, Usage, Weakness, and Neutral also don't apply because the context is specifically about differing results. Therefore, the correct class is CoCoRes.
