Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation tagged here. The passage is talking about the role of fungal endophytes in plant disease resistance. The sentence says, "Fungal endophytes have been reported to confer resistance to various plant pathogens through the production of antibiotics or by inducing systemic resistance in host plants @@CITATION@." 

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The author is stating a general fact that fungal endophytes help plants resist pathogens either by making antibiotics or inducing resistance. The citation is supporting this claim by providing prior research.

Next, the general intent here seems to be supporting the current statement with existing literature. The author isn't comparing methods or results, nor are they critiquing the cited work. They're just confirming that this information is established in the field. 

Looking at the options, "Support" would fit because the citation is used to back up the claim made in the sentence. The example given for Support mentions that the citation supports or confirms the work, which aligns with this case. There's no indication of comparison, motivation, or future work here. So the specific rhetorical class should be Support.
