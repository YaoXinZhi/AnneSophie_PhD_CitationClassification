Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. The task is to determine the rhetorical class of the citation in the given passage. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." 

The key part here is the phrase "substantially differ from the results of..." This indicates that the authors are comparing their results with those from the cited work. 

Next, looking at the general intent. The authors are contrasting their findings with previous experimental results. According to the step 2 guidelines, this falls under Comparative intent. 

Now, checking the specific rhetorical classes under Comparative. The options are CoCoGM, CoCoRes, or CoCoXY. The example for CoCoRes mentions comparing results directly. The given example is similar: the authors state their results differ from those in the cited paper, which aligns with CoCoRes. 

Therefore, the correct class here is CoCoRes.
