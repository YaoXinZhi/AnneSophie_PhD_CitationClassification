Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. The user provided a citation within a scientific passage about plant health. The task is to determine the rhetorical class of the citation from the given options.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." The key part here is comparing the results of the current study with those from the cited work.

Next, identifying the general intent. The phrase "substantially differ from the results" indicates a direct comparison of findings between the two studies. According to the definitions, this falls under Comparative, specifically CoCoRes since it's about comparing results.

Looking at the examples for CoCoRes, the example given is similar: comparing results of experiments. The user's example mentions differing results, which aligns with CoCoRes. There's no mention of contrasting methods or goals, so CoCoGM isn't applicable. The citation isn't supporting or criticizing, so Support or Weakness are out. Therefore, the correct class here is CoCoRes.
