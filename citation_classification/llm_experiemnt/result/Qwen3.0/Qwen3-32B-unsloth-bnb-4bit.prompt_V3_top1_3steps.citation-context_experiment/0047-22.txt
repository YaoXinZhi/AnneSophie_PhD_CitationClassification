Okay, let me try to work through this step by step. The task is to classify the citation in the given passage into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage provided is:

"In the study of plant pathogenic fungi, the role of secondary metabolites in host specificity has been a topic of interest. @@CITATION@@ investigated the production of these metabolites in *Fusarium oxysporum* and their correlation with pathogenicity. Our research expands on these findings by examining a broader range of fungal isolates and their interactions with different host plants."

So the citation here is discussing the work of someone who looked at secondary metabolites in Fusarium oxysporum and their relation to pathogenicity. The authors of the current paper say they're expanding on these findings with a broader study.

Next, identifying the general intent. The phrase "expands on these findings" suggests that the cited work is foundational to their current research. The current study is building upon the previous work, which would point towards the Basis class. Basis is when the citation references the intellectual foundation. 

But wait, maybe it's a Support? Because they are confirming or building on the findings. However, Support is when the citation is used to support the current work's claims. In this case, the cited work is what they are building upon, so it's more about the foundation. 

Looking at the examples for Basis: the example mentions that the cited work introduced a method which the current study replicates. Here, the cited study's findings are the basis for the expansion. 

Alternatively, if they were comparing methods or results, it might be CoCoGM or CoCoRes, but the passage doesn't mention a comparison, just expansion. 

The Motivation class is about justifying the research, like a knowledge gap. The current passage says they are expanding on previous findings, which might imply there's more to explore, but the main intent here is that the cited work is foundational. 

So the most fitting class here is Basis. The cited work's research is the foundation upon which the current study builds.
