Okay, let's tackle this classification task step by step. The user provided a passage with a citation and wants me to assign the correct rhetorical class from the given list. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage is: "The effectiveness of the proposed method was validated through experiments comparing it with existing approaches, such as those described by @@CITATION@@. The results showed significant improvements in accuracy." 

So the context here is about comparing the new method with existing ones, specifically referencing the cited work. The key part is "comparing it with existing approaches, such as those described by @@CITATION@@", followed by the results showing improvements.

Next, identifying the general intent. The citation is used to compare the methods or results of the cited work with the current paper's approach. Since the comparison is about the methods or results, I need to determine which specific rhetorical class applies here. The options for comparison are CoCoGM, CoCoRes, or CoCoXY. 

CoCoGM is for comparing goals or methods. The example given involves comparing methods, like a different approach to 'debias' word embeddings. In the current case, the citation is mentioned as an existing approach, so it's likely a comparison of methods or results. The example for CoCoRes compares results directly. Here, the passage mentions experiments comparing the method with existing approaches, and the results showed improvements. So it's comparing the results of the cited work with the current study's results. Therefore, this should be CoCoRes.

But wait, let me double-check. The example for CoCoRes says "comparison or contrast the results or findings". The passage states that their results showed significant improvements compared to the cited work. That's a direct comparison of results. So CoCoRes is the correct class here. 

Alternatively, if the comparison was about goals or methods, it would be CoCoGM, but the context here is about the outcomes (results) of the experiments. Hence, CoCoRes is the right choice.
