Okay, let's start by looking at the passage provided. The citation is mentioned in the sentence: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." The key phrase here is "described in detail previously," which indicates that the cited work is the source where the experimental setup was originally detailed.

Now, referring back to the rhetorical classes, the "Usage" class is defined as when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup from the cited work that is directly used in the current study. In this case, the experimental setup from the cited work is being referenced as the basis for the current study's setup. The authors are not comparing results, supporting their findings, or critiquing the previous work; they're simply stating that they used the setup as previously described. 

Therefore, the most appropriate rhetorical class here is "Usage" because the citation is pointing to an experimental setup that the current study is using directly from the cited source.
