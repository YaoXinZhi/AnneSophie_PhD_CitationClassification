Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage mentions a study by @@CITATION@@ that demonstrated the prevention of hard calcite scale formation using a magnetic field. The current research aims to understand the mechanism behind this magnetic treatment's effect. 

Next, identifying the general intent. The citation here is being used to justify why the current research is being conducted. The authors reference their previous work's promising results (magnetic field preventing scale) and state that the explanation is not yet offered, hence the purpose of the current work. This fits under Motivational intent because it's about justifying the need for the current study based on prior findings.

Now, selecting the specific rhetorical class. The example given under Motivation shows that when previous research identifies a knowledge gap or promising results leading to the current study, it's classified as Motivation. Here, the citation is used to highlight a result (successful prevention) that hasn't been explained yet, thus motivating the current research to address that gap. So the correct class should be Motivation.
