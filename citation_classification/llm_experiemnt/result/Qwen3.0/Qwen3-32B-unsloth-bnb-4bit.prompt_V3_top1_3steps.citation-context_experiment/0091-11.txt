Okay, let's tackle this classification problem step by step. First, I need to look at the context around the citation to understand why it's being referenced. The passage says, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." 

So the key part here is "substantially differ from the results of the experiments..." That immediately makes me think that the authors are comparing their results with those from the cited work. The rhetorical classes related to comparison are CoCoGM, CoCoRes, or CoCoXY. 

Now, the example given for CoCoRes mentions comparing results directly. In this case, the authors are stating that their results differ from those in the cited paper. Since they're directly contrasting their findings with the cited study's findings, this fits under CoCoRes. 

I should check if it's not CoCoGM or CoCoXY. CoCoGM would involve comparing goals or methods, which isn't the case here. The example for CoCoXY involves comparing two cited studies with each other, not the citing paper's results. Here, the comparison is between the current work and the cited work's results. Therefore, CoCoRes is the correct class.
