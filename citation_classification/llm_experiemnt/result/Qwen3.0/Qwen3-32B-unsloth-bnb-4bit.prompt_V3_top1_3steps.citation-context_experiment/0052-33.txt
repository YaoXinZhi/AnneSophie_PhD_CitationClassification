Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. First, I need to look at the context around the citation in the given passage. The passage mentions that the authors used a specific method called "qPCR" and references a previous study by @@CITATION@@ where this method was described. 

So, the context here is about the method they're using. The key part is "as described previously by @@CITATION@@", which indicates that the cited work is where the method was first introduced or explained. 

Next, I need to determine the general intent. Since the citation is pointing to where the method was previously described, it's providing the foundational source for that method. The authors are referencing the origin or the original description of the technique they're using.

Looking at the definitions, "Usage" is when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup used directly in the current study. The example given under Usage mentions an experimental setup described previously. In this case, the method (qPCR) is being referenced as it was previously described, so it fits the Usage category because they are directly using the method from the cited work.

I should check if there's any other possible class. It's not Basis because Basis is about intellectual foundation, not the method itself. It's not Support or Similar either. The correct fit here is definitely Usage.
