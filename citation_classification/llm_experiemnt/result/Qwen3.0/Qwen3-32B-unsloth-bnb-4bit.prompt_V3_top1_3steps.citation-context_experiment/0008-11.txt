Okay, let me try to figure this out. The task is to classify the citation in the given passage into one of the specified rhetorical classes. 

First, I need to look at the context around the citation. The passage is: "The effectiveness of the method was confirmed by @@CITATION@@ using a different set of plant samples." 

Step 1: Extracting the context. The key part here is "confirmed by @@CITATION@@ using a different set of plant samples." The authors are saying that their method's effectiveness was confirmed by another study that used different samples. 

Step 2: Identifying the general intent. The word "confirmed" suggests that the cited work supports their findings. They're using the citation to back up their own results, showing that another study also supports the effectiveness. So this seems like a supportive intent.

Step 3: Choosing the specific class. Looking at the definitions, "Support" is when the citation is used to support or confirm the work, results, or findings. The example given for Support mentions that the subscales were consistent with previous research. In this case, the citation is confirming the method's effectiveness, so it fits "Support."

Wait, could it be "Similar"? The example for Similar points out a similarity between the cited work and the citing paper. But here, the authors are saying their method was confirmed by another study, which is more about supporting their claim rather than pointing out a similarity. So "Support" seems more accurate.
