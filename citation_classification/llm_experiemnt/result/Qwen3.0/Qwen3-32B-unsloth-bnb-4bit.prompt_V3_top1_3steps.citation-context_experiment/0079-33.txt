Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the given citation. First, I'll look at the context around the citation. The sentence is: "The effectiveness of the newly developed method was validated by comparing it with traditional approaches described by @@CITATION@@." 

So the authors are talking about their new method and they validated it by comparing it to traditional approaches from the cited work. The key here is the comparison between their method and the traditional ones mentioned in the citation. 

The general intent here seems to be comparative. The options for comparative are CoCoGM, CoCoRes, or CoCoXY. Let's break it down. CoCoGM is about comparing goals or methods. Since the sentence mentions comparing the new method with traditional approaches, that's about methods. So CoCoGM would fit here because they're contrasting their method with the cited work's methods. 

CoCoRes would be if they were comparing results, but the sentence doesn't mention results specificallyâ€”it's about the methods themselves. CoCoXY is for comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies, which isn't the case here. 

So the specific class should be CoCoGM.
