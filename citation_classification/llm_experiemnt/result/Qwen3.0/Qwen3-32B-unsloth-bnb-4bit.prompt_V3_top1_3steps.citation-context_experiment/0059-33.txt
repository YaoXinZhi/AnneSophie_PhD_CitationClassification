Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage is about a study on phytoplasma strains in daisy plants, mentioning Wei et al., 2004 and Saracco et al., 2006, and then citing @@CITATION@@ regarding conflicting results in Euphorbia pulcherrima. 

The key part here is that the citation is pointing out conflicting results in another study. The authors are comparing two different studies (the ones from Wei and Saracco with the one cited) to highlight a discrepancy in findings related to a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima.

Next, identifying the intent. Since they're contrasting the cited study's results with others, it's a comparison of results. The example given for CoCoRes mentions comparing results between the current work and a cited paper. However, in this case, the comparison is between two cited studies, not the citing paper and a cited one. Wait, the example for CoCoXY says it's comparing two cited studies with each other, not involving the citing paper. The example under CoCoXY mentions conflicting results between two cited works. 

In the given passage, the authors are contrasting the results of Wei et al. and Saracco et al. with the results from the cited study (Euphorbia pulcherrima). Since they're comparing the cited work with another cited work, not their own results, this fits CoCoXY, which is for comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies. The example under CoCoXY is about conflicting results between two studies, which matches the scenario here. So the correct class should be CoCoXY.
