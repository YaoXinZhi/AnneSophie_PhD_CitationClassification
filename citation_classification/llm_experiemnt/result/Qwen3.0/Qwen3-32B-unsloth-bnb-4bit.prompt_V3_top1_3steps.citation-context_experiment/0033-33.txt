Okay, let's tackle this citation classification task. First, I need to look at the provided passage and the context around the @@CITATION@@ marker. The passage says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@."

So, the key part here is that the authors are comparing their results with those from another study that used different metal targets. The phrase "substantially differ" indicates a direct comparison of results. According to the definitions given, CoCoRes is when the citation is used to compare or contrast the results or findings of the cited work with the citing paper. The example provided for CoCoRes also involves contrasting results, which aligns with this case. There's no mention of methods or goals here, so it's not CoCoGM. It's not about supporting their own findings, so not Support. And there's no criticism, so not Weakness. The main intent is to highlight differing results, so CoCoRes is the correct class.
