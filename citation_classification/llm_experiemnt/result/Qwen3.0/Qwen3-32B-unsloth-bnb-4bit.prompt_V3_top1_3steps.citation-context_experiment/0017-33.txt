Okay, let me try to work through this classification step by step. The task is to determine the rhetorical class of the citation marked @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage provided is: 

"@@CITATION@@ reported the presence of the pathogen in several locations across the country, highlighting the widespread nature of the disease."

So the context is that the citation is being used to state that the cited work reported the presence of a pathogen in multiple locations, emphasizing how widespread the disease is. 

Next, I have to figure out the general intent of the citation. The authors are referencing another study that showed the pathogen's presence in various areas. This seems like they're using that study to support their own point about the disease's spread. The phrase "highlighting the widespread nature" suggests that they're using the citation to back up their assertion or to provide evidence for the extent of the disease. 

Looking at the possible intents: Supportive intent would fall under Support or Similar. Since they're confirming or supporting their own statement with the cited work's findings, it's likely Support. The example given for Support mentions that the citation supports the work, results, or findings of the citing authors. In this case, the cited work's report on locations supports the current paper's point about the disease being widespread.

Now, checking the specific classes. Support is when the citation is used to support the current work. The example given in the instructions is about subscales being consistent with previous research. Here, the presence in multiple locations supports the current assertion of widespread disease. 

I should make sure it's not Similar. Similar is when there's a similarity between the cited work and the current paper. The example for Similar mentions findings supporting cross-taxon investigations. In this case, the current paper isn't necessarily finding the same thing but using the citation to back up their statement. So it's more about supporting their claim rather than pointing out a similarity in results. 

Therefore, the correct class here is Support.
