Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to look at the context around the citation. The passage says, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." 

So the key part here is that the authors are comparing their results with those from another study. The phrase "substantially differ" indicates a direct comparison of findings. According to the definitions, CoCoRes is used when comparing results or findings between the cited work and the current paper. The example given in the instructions matches this scenario exactly, where the current results are contrasted with those from the cited work.

Next, I check other possible classes. It's not Basis because there's no mention of foundational work. It's not CoCoGM since the comparison isn't about goals or methods. The intent here is clearly about the results, so CoCoRes fits best. There's no motivation, future work, support, similarity, usage, weakness, or neutral description here. Therefore, the correct label should be CoCoRes.
