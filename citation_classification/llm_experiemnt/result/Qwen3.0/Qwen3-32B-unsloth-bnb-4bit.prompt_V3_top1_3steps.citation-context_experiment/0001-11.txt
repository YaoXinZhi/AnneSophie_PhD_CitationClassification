Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. First, I need to look at the citation context provided. The passage mentions: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." 

So the key part here is that they're comparing their own results with those from the cited work. The phrase "substantially differ" indicates a direct comparison of results. According to the definitions, CoCoRes is when the citation is used to compare or contrast the results or findings of the cited work with the citing paper. The example given for CoCoRes is almost identical in structure, talking about differing results. 

Looking at other classes, Basis would be foundational work, which doesn't fit here. Motivation would be about justifying the research, which isn't the case. Support would be confirming their findings with previous work, but here it's a contrast. CoCoGM is about goals or methods, but the comparison here is about results. So CoCoRes is the correct class.
