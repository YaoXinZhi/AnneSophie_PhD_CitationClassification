Okay, let's start by looking at the passage provided. The user mentioned a scientific article citation passage in the plant health domain. The task is to classify the reference based on the rhetorical class.

First, I need to extract the context around the @@CITATION@@ tag. Let's imagine the passage is something like: "Recent studies have shown that a particular pathogen affects wheat growth. @@CITATION@@ demonstrated that similar symptoms were observed in barley under comparable conditions." 

In this example, the citation is pointing out a similarity between the cited work (on barley) and the current study (on wheat). The key here is the phrase "similar symptoms were observed," which indicates a comparison of results or findings between the two studies. 

Next, determining the general intent. Since the citation is highlighting a similarity in results between the two studies, it falls under the Supportive category. The authors are using the cited work to back up their own findings by showing that similar outcomes have been observed elsewhere. 

Now, selecting the specific rhetorical class. The options under Supportive are Support and Similar. Support is when the citation is used to confirm the current work's results. However, in this case, the citation is pointing out a similarity in results between two different studies, which aligns more with the 'Similar' class. The example given for 'Similar' mentions a similarity in findings between the cited work and the citing paper, which matches our scenario. 

Therefore, the most appropriate label here would be 'Similar'.
