Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The task is to determine the rhetorical class of the citation in the given passage. The passage is about a study on the effects of a magnetic field on preventing calcite scale formation in hard water.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The citation is mentioned in the sentence: "Our previous research @@CITATION@@ has shown that the formation of the hard calcite scale on the surfaces exposed to hard water can be successfully prevented with the applied magnetic field. The explanation of the phenomena is not yet offered and the purpose of this work is to try to understand the mechanism of the beneficial influence of the magnetic treatment."

So the context is that the authors are referencing their own previous work which demonstrated an effect of magnetic fields on preventing calcite scale. They mention that while they've shown the effect works, the underlying explanation is still unknown, which is why they're doing this new studyâ€”to understand the mechanism.

Next, identifying the general intent. The previous research is cited to justify the current study. The authors are pointing out that even though they've shown the magnetic treatment works, they don't know why. This sets up the motivation for their current research. The citation here is used to establish why the current work is being done, highlighting a knowledge gap (they don't know the mechanism) that this new study aims to address.

Looking at the categories, "Motivation" is for citations that justify why the current research is conducted, such as by identifying a knowledge gap. The example given under Motivation is similar: citing previous work to show a phenomenon was observed but the explanation isn't known, hence motivating the current study.

So the specific rhetorical class here should be Motivation.
