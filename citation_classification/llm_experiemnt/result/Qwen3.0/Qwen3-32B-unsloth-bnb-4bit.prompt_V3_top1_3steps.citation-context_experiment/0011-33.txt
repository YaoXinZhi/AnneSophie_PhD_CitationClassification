Okay, let's start by looking at the citation passage provided. The user has given a specific example where the task is to classify the rhetorical class of the citation. The passage is: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The key part here is "was described in detail previously," which indicates that the cited work is being referenced for its detailed description of the experimental setup.

Next, identifying the general intent. The phrase "was described in detail previously" suggests that the current study is using the experimental setup from the cited work. This points towards the technical use of the cited work's method or setup. According to the definitions provided, when a citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup directly used in the current study, it falls under the "Usage" class.

Comparing with the example given under "Usage," the example states: "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." This matches exactly with the passage provided. Therefore, the rhetorical class here should be "Usage."
