Okay, let's tackle this citation classification. The passage is about plant health, specifically dealing with phytoplasma strains in daisy plants. The citation is mentioned in the context of conflicting results regarding a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima. 

First, I need to extract the relevant context. The sentence says that while some studies report high concentrations of phytoplasma in certain parts of daisy plants, there are conflicting results in another study cited here. The key here is that the citation is being used to highlight a contradiction between two studies.

Next, determining the general intent. The authors are pointing out conflicting results between their mentioned studies and the cited one. This doesn't seem to be supporting their own work, but rather comparing the explanations or claims of different studies. The example given for CoCoXY involves comparing two cited studies with each other, not with the current paper. Since the citation here is used to contrast findings between two different phytoplasma studies, it fits the CoCoXY category. 

So the rhetorical class should be CoCoXY because it's comparing conflicting results between two cited works.
