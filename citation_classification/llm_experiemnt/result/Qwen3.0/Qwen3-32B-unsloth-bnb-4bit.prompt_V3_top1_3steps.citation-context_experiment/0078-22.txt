Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in the given passage. The passage is: "The presence of phytoplasma in the phloem tissue of infected plants is a well-established fact (Jesudhasan et al., 2000) @@CITATION@@." 

First, Step 1 is to extract the context around the citation. The sentence is stating that the presence of phytoplasma in phloem tissue is well-established and then cites Jesudhasan et al., 2000. The context here is that the cited work is supporting the claim that this presence is a known fact.

Moving to Step 2: Identify the general intent. The citation is being used to back up the assertion that the fact is well-established. So the intent is supportive, meaning it's used to confirm or support the current statement.

Looking at the options for supportive intent, the possible classes are Support or Similar. Support is when the citation is used to support the work, result, or finding of the citing authors. The example given for Support is where subscales were consistent with previous research, and the citation supports that. 

In the given passage, the authors are stating a fact that's well-established and using the citation to confirm that. So this seems like Support because they're using the cited work to support their current assertion. 

Is there a possibility it's Similar? The Similar class is when there's a similarity between the cited work and the citing paper, like results or observations. But here, the citation is just confirming a general fact, not pointing out a similarity. 

So the correct class should be Support. The Weakness or others don't fit here because there's no criticism or comparison. It's purely supporting their statement with prior research.

Step 1: Context extraction  
"The presence of phytoplasma in the phloem tissue of infected plants is a well-established fact (Jesudhasan et al., 2000) @@CITATION@@."  

Step 2: General intent identification  
The citation is used to confirm the claim that phytoplasma presence in phloem tissue is a "well-established fact." This indicates a **Supportive** intent.  

Step 3: Specific rhetorical class selection  
The citation directly supports the assertion in the citing paper by referencing prior research validating the claim. This aligns with the **Support** class definition.  

**Support**
