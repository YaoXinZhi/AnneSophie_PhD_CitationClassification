Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. The citation is in the passage: "The use of resistant varieties is a key strategy for managing downy mildew in grapevines @@CITATION@@." 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The sentence states that resistant varieties are a key strategy, and then cites a source. The intent here seems to be supporting the statement by referencing prior work that validates this strategy. 

Looking at the general intent categories: Supportive would fit because the citation is used to back up the claim made in the sentence. The example provided for 'Support' mentions that the citation confirms the work of the citing authors, which aligns with this case. The cited work is likely providing evidence or confirmation that resistant varieties are indeed a key strategy.

Now, checking the specific rhetorical classes under Supportive: 'Support' is the direct match here. The example given for Support is when a citation is used to support or confirm the citing authors' work. In this case, the citation supports the assertion about resistant varieties being a key strategy. There's no indication of similarity to another study, so 'Similar' isn't right. The citation isn't used to compare methods or results either, so CoCoGM or CoCoRes don't apply. There's no criticism, so Weakness is out. The citation isn't motivating the current research but rather supporting an existing claim. Therefore, the correct class should be Support.
