Okay, let's see. I need to classify the citation in the given passage. The passage is about plant health, specifically dealing with phytoplasma strains in daisy plants and conflicting results in Euphorbia pulcherrima.

First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The sentence mentions that two strains of 'Ca. Phytoplasma asteris' were reported in young leaves and roots, but conflicting results were described for a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima, followed by the citation. 

The intent here is comparing conflicting results between two studies. The example given for CoCoXY involves comparing two cited studies with each other, not with the current paper. The example provided uses CoCoXY when there are conflicting results between two studies. In this case, the citation is pointing out conflicting results in a different study (Euphorbia pulcherrima) compared to the previous ones. 

So the rhetorical class here is CoCoXY because it's contrasting the findings of two different cited works (the ones on daisy plants and the one on Euphorbia pulcherrima) without directly relating to the current study's results. The current paper is referencing the conflict between these two cited works.
