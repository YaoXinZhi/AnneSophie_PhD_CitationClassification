Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. The user provided a citation passage and wants me to determine the appropriate rhetorical class from the given list.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage is: "The effectiveness of the proposed method was validated through experiments comparing it with existing approaches, as detailed in @@CITATION@@." The key part here is that they're comparing their method with existing ones using experiments, referencing the citation for that comparison.

Next, identifying the general intent. The citation is used to compare the current work's results with those of existing approaches. Comparing results falls under the Comparative category. Now, looking at the specific classes under Comparative: CoCoRes is for comparing results or findings. The example given for CoCoRes mentions differing results from experiments, which aligns with the passage here where experiments are used to compare effectiveness.

So, the specific rhetorical class here should be CoCoRes because the citation is directly used to compare the results of the cited work with the current study's results.
