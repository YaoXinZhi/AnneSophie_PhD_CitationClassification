Okay, let me try to figure out the rhetorical class for this citation. First, I need to look at the context around the @@CITATION@@. The sentence says, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@."

So the key part here is comparing their results with those from another study. The phrase "substantially differ" indicates a direct comparison of results. According to the definitions, CoCoRes is when the citation is used to compare or contrast the results or findings of the cited work with the citing paper. That matches here because they're talking about their results differing from the cited experiments. The example given for CoCoRes also involves comparing results, which aligns with this case. There's no mention of methods or goals, so it's not CoCoGM. It's a straightforward result comparison, so CoCoRes is the right class.
