Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The task is to classify the citation in the given passage into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage is: "The presence of these phytoplasmas in herbaceous ornamental plants has been reported previously @@CITATION@@." The citation here is referring to prior reports about phytoplasmas in ornamental plants.

Next, identify the general intent. The authors are mentioning that their findings have been reported before, so they're pointing out existing literature. This seems like they're establishing that this is not a new finding, which might be to support their current work by citing previous studies. 

Looking at the options, "Support" is when the citation is used to back up the current work's findings. Here, they're using the citation to show that previous research has already documented the presence, which supports their current context. Alternatively, "Basis" is for foundational work, but since they're not building on it methodologically or theoretically, just confirming it's been noted before, "Support" seems more accurate. There's no comparison or criticism here, so CoCo or Weakness don't fit. Neutral is when it's just a factual mention without supporting an argument, but here it's supporting their statement that it's been reported. So the correct class should be Support.
