Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to look at the citation passage provided. The passage is:

"@@CITATION@@ demonstrated the effectiveness of a new fungicide in controlling powdery mildew in grapevines under controlled conditions."

Step 1: Extract the context discussing the citation. The sentence directly states that the cited work showed the fungicide's effectiveness against powdery mildew in controlled grapevine conditions.

Step 2: Determine the general intent. The authors are referencing a study that confirmed the fungicide's effectiveness. They're using this citation to back up their own work or findings. Since they're supporting their claims with the cited study's results, this points towards a Supportive intent.

Step 3: Choose the specific rhetorical class. The example under Support mentions citing previous research to confirm findings. Here, the citation is used to support the current work's validity or to confirm results. So, the correct label should be Support.
