Okay, let's tackle this citation classification problem. First, I need to look at the passage provided and identify the context around the @@CITATION@@. The passage says, "The efficacy of the proposed method was validated through field trials, which demonstrated a significant reduction in pest infestation levels compared to conventional methods, as previously reported by @@CITATION@@." 

So, the citation here is being used to reference a previous study that also reported on the reduction in pest infestation levels. The key part here is "as previously reported by @@CITATION@@", which indicates that the current study's results are similar to what was found in the cited work. 

Next, I need to determine the general intent. The authors are pointing out that their findings align with previous results, which suggests a supportive or similar intent. Comparing the options, "Support" would mean the citation is used to back up their own findings, while "Similar" would indicate that the cited work has similar results or observations.

Looking at the example for "Support": it's when the citation confirms the work or results of the citing authors. In this case, the current study's results are supported by the previous report, so "Support" seems fitting. However, the example for "Similar" mentions pointing out a similarity between the cited work and the current paper, which could also apply here since they're both reporting reduced pest infestations. 

But the phrase "as previously reported" is more about confirming their results with prior work, which leans towards "Support". The "Similar" class is more about noting that the cited work and the current paper have similar findings, but the example given in the task for "Support" uses "consistent with previous research" and "also using a U.S. sample", which is analogous here. Therefore, the correct class is likely "Support".
