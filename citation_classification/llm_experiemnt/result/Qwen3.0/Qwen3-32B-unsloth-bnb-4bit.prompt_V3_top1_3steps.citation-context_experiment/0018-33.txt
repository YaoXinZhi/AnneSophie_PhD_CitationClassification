Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. The task is to determine the rhetorical class of the citation marked @@CITATION@@ in the given passage. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@."

So, the context here is that the current study's results are being compared as differing substantially from those of experiments using specific deuterium-saturated metal targets cited in @@CITATION@@. 

Next, identify the general intent. The key phrase here is "substantially differ from the results of the experiments," which indicates a direct comparison between the current results and those of the cited work. According to the definitions, this falls under Comparative intent, specifically CoCoRes since it's comparing results.

Now, checking the specific examples for CoCoRes: the example given is a comparison of results between the present work and a cited study. The structure here matches exactly, as the passage states a difference in results from the cited experiments. 

Therefore, the most appropriate class here is CoCoRes.
