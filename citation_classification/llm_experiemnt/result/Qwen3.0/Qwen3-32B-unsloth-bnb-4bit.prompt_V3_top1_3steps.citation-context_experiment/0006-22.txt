Okay, let me tackle this step by step. First, I need to look at the context around the citation in the given passage. The passage is about plant health, specifically dealing with bacterial communities in insect hosts. The sentence says, "Our finding that insect hosts affect bacterial community assembly... is supported by recent cross-taxon investigations of other insect-associated bacteria. In fleas and ticks, the arthropod host governed bacterial assemblages whereas rodent host and environmental conditions did not @@CITATION@." 

So, the authors are mentioning that their finding is supported by another study. The key word here is "supported," which suggests that the cited work backs up their own findings. Looking at the definitions, the Support class is when the citation is used to confirm the work, result, or finding of the citing authors. The example given for Support is similar: they mention consistency with previous research and reference a specific citation.

The citation here is pointing out that another study also found similar results regarding host influence on bacterial communities. There's no comparison of methods or goals, nor is there criticism. It's purely about supporting their finding with existing literature. Therefore, the rhetorical class should be Support.
