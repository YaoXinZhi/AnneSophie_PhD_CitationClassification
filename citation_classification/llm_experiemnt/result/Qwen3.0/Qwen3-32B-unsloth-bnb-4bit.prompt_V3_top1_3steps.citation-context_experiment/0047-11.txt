Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. The task is to determine the rhetorical class of the citation in the given passage. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage provided is:

"@@CITATION@@ reported that the pathogen can be transmitted through mechanical inoculation onto indicator plants, which aligns with our findings of systemic infection in the tested species."

The citation here is used to reference a previous study that reported transmission via mechanical inoculation onto indicator plants. The next part says this aligns with the current findings of systemic infection in the tested species.

Step 1: Extract the context. The key part is "reported that... aligns with our findings." This suggests that the cited work's results are being compared to the current study's results.

Step 2: Identify the general intent. The phrase "aligns with our findings" indicates that the authors are showing their results are consistent with previous work. This points towards a supportive intent, where the citation is used to back up their own findings.

Looking at the possible classes, Support is when the citation supports or confirms the work, result, or finding of the citing authors. The example given for Support mentions consistency with previous research. Here, the alignment suggests support.

CoCoRes involves comparing results directly, but in the example, the comparison is between the cited work and the citing paper's results. However, in this case, the citation is used to support their findings by showing alignment, not to contrast or compare differences. The example for Support mentions consistency, which matches this scenario better than CoCoRes.

Therefore, the rhetorical class here is Support.
