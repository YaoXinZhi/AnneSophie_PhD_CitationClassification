Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage is about the detection of phytoplasma in daisy plants, mentioning Wei et al., 2004 and Saracco et al., 2006, and then citing @@CITATION@@ regarding conflicting results in Euphorbia pulcherrima. The key part here is the mention of conflicting results from the cited work compared to previous studies.

Next, identifying the intent. The authors are pointing out that there are conflicting results in the cited study. This suggests a comparison between the cited work and others, but the example given for CoCoXY involves comparing two cited studies with each other, not the citing paper. The example mentions conflicting results in a specific case, which aligns with CoCoXY's focus on comparing explanations or claims between cited studies rather than with the current paper. 

Since the citation here is highlighting conflicting results in a different study (Euphorbia pulcherrima) compared to previous ones, it fits CoCoXY. There's no direct comparison to the current study's methods or results, just contrasting the cited study's findings with others. Therefore, the rhetorical class should be CoCoXY.
