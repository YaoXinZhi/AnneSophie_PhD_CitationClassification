Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. The passage given is: "The use of resistant plant varieties is a key strategy in the management of plant diseases, as highlighted by @@CITATION@@ who demonstrated the effectiveness of resistant cultivars in reducing the incidence of Fusarium wilt in tomato crops."

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The main point here is that the authors are talking about using resistant plant varieties as a key strategy for managing plant diseases. They reference the citation to show that someone else demonstrated the effectiveness of resistant cultivars in reducing Fusarium wilt in tomatoes.

Next, determining the general intent. The citation is being used to support the idea that resistant varieties are effective. The authors aren't comparing their work to the cited one, nor are they criticizing it. They're using the cited work as an example or evidence to back up their own statement about the strategy's importance. That sounds like a supportive intent.

Now, looking at the specific rhetorical classes under Supportive. The example given for "Support" mentions that the citation supports the work of the citing authors. In this case, the citation supports the claim that resistant varieties are a key strategy. The example provided in the definition says something similar: using a citation to confirm their findings. Here, the authors are confirming their assertion with the cited study's results. 

It's not "Similar" because they aren't pointing out similarities between their results and the cited work, just that the cited work supports their general point. It's also not "Basis" because they're not establishing a foundational reference but rather providing evidence. No comparison or criticism is happening here either. So the most fitting class here is "Support."
