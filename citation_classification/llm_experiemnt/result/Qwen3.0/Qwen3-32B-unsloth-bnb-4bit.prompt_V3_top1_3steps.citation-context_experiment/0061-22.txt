Okay, let's tackle this citation classification. First, I need to look at the context around the @@CITATION@@. The passage says, "The experimental set-up was described in detail previously @@CITATION@@." 

So, Step 1 is extracting the context. The key part here is that the setup was described "previously" and the citation is pointing to where that setup was detailed. 

Moving to Step 2: Identifying the intent. The authors are referencing a prior description of the experimental setup. They're not comparing methods or results, nor are they criticizing or supporting something new. They're just indicating where the setup was first explained. 

Looking at the definitions, the Usage class is when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup from the cited work that's directly used in the current study. The example given is about an experimental setup described previously, which matches exactly what's in the passage here.

So Step 3 would be selecting Usage as the rhetorical class. The citation is directly pointing to where the experimental setup was detailed, which the current study is using. No other intent like comparison or support is present here. Therefore, the correct label should be Usage.
