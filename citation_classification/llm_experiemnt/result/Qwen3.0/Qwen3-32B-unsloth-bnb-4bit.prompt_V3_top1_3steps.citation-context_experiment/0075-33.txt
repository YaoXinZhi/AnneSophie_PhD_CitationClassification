Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to look at the citation passage provided. The passage is: "The effectiveness of this approach has been demonstrated in several studies, including one by @@CITATION@@ which showed a significant reduction in pest populations."

Step 1 is to extract the context around the citation. The key part here is that the citation is mentioned as showing a significant reduction in pest populations. The context is about the effectiveness of an approach being demonstrated through studies, specifically citing one that showed results.

Moving to Step 2, identifying the general intent. The citation is being used to support the claim that the approach is effective. The authors are referencing another study that confirmed their approach's effectiveness by showing reduced pest populations. This seems like they're using the cited work to back up their own claims, so the intent is supportive.

Now Step 3 is to assign the specific rhetorical class. Looking at the options, "Support" is when the citation supports or confirms the work, results, or findings of the citing authors. The example given for Support mentions that the subscales were consistent with previous research, which aligns with how the citation here is used to support the effectiveness claim. The cited study's results are used to confirm the citing paper's approach. So the correct label here should be Support.
