Okay, let me try to work through this step by step. So the task is to classify the rhetorical class of a citation in a scientific article passage related to plant health. The citation is marked as @@CITATION@@.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage given is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@."

So the key part here is that the authors are comparing their results to those from a previous study that used deuterium-saturated metal targets. The phrase "substantially differ" indicates a direct comparison of results between the current work and the cited work.

Next, according to the guidelines, I need to determine the general intent. The options are Foundational, Comparative, Motivational, Supportive, Technical, Critical/Analytical, or Descriptive. Here, since the citation is used to compare results, the intent falls under Comparative. 

Now, within Comparative, there are three subclasses: CoCoGM (Comparison of Goals or Methods), CoCoRes (Comparison of Results), and CoCoXY (Comparison of Explanations or Claims). The example given for CoCoRes mentions comparing results directly. The current passage does exactly thatâ€”it states that their results differ from those in the cited experiments. Therefore, this should be CoCoRes.

I need to make sure there's no other possible class. CoCoGM would involve comparing goals or methods, but the sentence specifically refers to results. CoCoXY compares two cited studies with each other, not the citing paper's results. So CoCoRes is the correct choice here.
