Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The task is to classify the rhetorical class of the citation in the given passage. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage says, “The role of plant health management in sustainable agriculture has been increasingly recognized. @@CITATION@@ has highlighted the importance of integrated pest management strategies in reducing chemical inputs while maintaining crop yields.” 

So the context is about the increasing recognition of plant health management in sustainable agriculture, and the citation is used to point out that the cited work highlighted the importance of integrated pest management strategies.

Next, identifying the general intent. The citation here is being used to support the current discussion by referencing a previous study that also emphasizes integrated pest management. The citing authors are using the cited work to back up their own point about the importance of these strategies. 

Looking at the definitions, "Support" is when the citation is used to support or confirm the work, result, or finding of the citing authors. The example given for Support mentions that the subscales were consistent with previous research, particularly that of the cited work. In this case, the authors are using the citation to support their discussion on the importance of integrated pest management, similar to the example. 

The other options don't fit as well. It's not a Basis because they're not establishing the foundation. It's not a Comparative class since they aren't comparing goals, methods, results, or explanations. It's not Motivation or Future either. Weakness and Neutral are out because there's no criticism or neutral description here. Usage doesn't apply because they're not using a method from the cited work. 

So the most appropriate class here is Support.
