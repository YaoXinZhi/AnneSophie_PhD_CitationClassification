Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user provided a passage with a citation and wants me to classify it into the correct rhetorical class.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." 

So the key part here is comparing their results to the ones from the cited work. The next step is identifying the intent. The authors are pointing out differences between their findings and those in the cited study. According to the definitions, this falls under Comparative intent, specifically CoCoRes since it's a comparison of results.

Looking at the examples for CoCoRes, the example given is very similar: comparing results directly. The user's passage uses "substantially differ," which aligns with contrasting results. Therefore, the correct class should be CoCoRes.
