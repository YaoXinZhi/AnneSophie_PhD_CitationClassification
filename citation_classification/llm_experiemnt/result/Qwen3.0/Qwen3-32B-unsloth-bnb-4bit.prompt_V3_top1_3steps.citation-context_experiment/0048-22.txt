Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. The user provided a passage with a citation and wants me to assign the correct rhetorical class from the given list.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The example passage is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." 

So the context here is comparing the current results with those from previous experiments using specific metal targets. The key phrase is "substantially differ," which indicates a direct comparison of results.

Next, identifying the general intent. The authors are contrasting their findings with those cited. According to the definitions, this falls under Comparative intent, specifically comparing results. The CoCoRes class is for comparing or contrasting results or findings of the cited work with the citing paper.

Looking at the example for CoCoRes, it's almost identical: comparing results obtained in the present work with those from cited experiments. The example uses "substantially differ," just like in the given case. Therefore, the correct class here is CoCoRes.
