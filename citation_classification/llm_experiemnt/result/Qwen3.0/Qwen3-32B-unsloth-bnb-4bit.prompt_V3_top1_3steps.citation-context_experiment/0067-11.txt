Okay, let me try to figure out the correct rhetorical class for this citation. 

First, I need to look at the context around the @@CITATION@@. The passage says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." 

So the key part here is that the authors are comparing their results with those from another study. They mention that their results "substantially differ," which indicates a direct comparison of findings. 

Looking at the step-by-step guide, Step 2 says if the citation is used to compare results or findings, it's CoCoRes. The example given for CoCoRes is similar: comparing results of experiments. 

In the example provided under CoCoRes, they have a sentence where the results are directly contrasted with another study's results, just like in this case. The authors here are pointing out a difference between their work and the cited work's results. 

So the general intent here is Comparative, specifically comparing results. Therefore, the specific class should be CoCoRes.
