Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to look at the citation passage provided. The user mentioned the context is about plant health, so I should keep that in mind.

The passage says: "The application of biocontrol agents for managing plant diseases has gained attention due to their eco-friendly nature. @@CITATION@@ demonstrated the effectiveness of Trichoderma species in suppressing soil-borne pathogens."

Step 1 is extracting the context around the citation. The key part here is "demonstrated the effectiveness of Trichoderma species in suppressing soil-borne pathogens." The citation is being used to show that Trichoderma works against pathogens, supporting the current discussion about biocontrol agents.

Step 2 is identifying the general intent. The authors are using the citation to back up their point about the effectiveness of biocontrol agents. That sounds like they're supporting their own argument with existing research. The example under 'Support' mentions a citation used to confirm findings, which aligns here. The cited work's results are supporting the current paper's discussion on biocontrol agents' effectiveness.

Step 3 is selecting the specific rhetorical class. Since the citation is used to support the citing authors' work or their argument, the correct class should be 'Support'.
