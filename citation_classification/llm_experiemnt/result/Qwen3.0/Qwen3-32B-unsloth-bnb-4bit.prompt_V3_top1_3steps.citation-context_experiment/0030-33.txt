Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." 

The key part here is that the authors are comparing their results to those from a previous study. The phrase "substantially differ" indicates a direct comparison of findings. 

Next, determining the general intent. Since they're contrasting their results with another's, this falls under Comparative intent. 

Now, looking at the specific rhetorical classes under Comparative: CoCoRes is for comparing results, which fits here. The example given for CoCoRes mentions differing results, just like in this case. 

So the final label should be CoCoRes.
