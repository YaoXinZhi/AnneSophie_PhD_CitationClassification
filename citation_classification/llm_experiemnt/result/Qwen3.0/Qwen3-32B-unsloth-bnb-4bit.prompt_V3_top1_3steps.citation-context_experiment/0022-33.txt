Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. The user provided a citation passage and wants me to determine the appropriate rhetorical class from the given list. 

First, I need to extract the context around the @@CITATION@@. The passage is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." 

Looking at this, the key part is "substantially differ from the results of the experiments..." which directly compares the current study's results with those from the cited work. 

Next, identifying the general intent. The comparison here is about the results, not methods or goals. The example given for CoCoRes mentions comparing results, which matches this scenario. The example provided for CoCoRes is similar: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments..." which is almost identical to the given passage. 

So, the citation is used to contrast the results of the current study with a previous one. Therefore, the specific rhetorical class here should be CoCoRes.
