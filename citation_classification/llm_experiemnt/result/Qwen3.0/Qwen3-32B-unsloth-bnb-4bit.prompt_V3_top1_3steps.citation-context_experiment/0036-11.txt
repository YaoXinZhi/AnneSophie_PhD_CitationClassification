Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in the given passage. First, I should extract the context around the citation. The passage is talking about a study on the effect of magnetic fields on calcite scale formation. The authors mention that their previous research showed magnetic fields prevent calcite scaling, and they reference @@CITATION@@ to support that claim.

So the context is that they're citing their own previous work to show they've already found that magnetic fields work, and now they want to understand the mechanism. The intent here seems to be foundational because they're establishing the basis for their current research. They're referencing their prior results as the foundation for why they're doing this new study. 

Looking at the definitions, Basis is when the citation is the intellectual foundation. The example given is about replicating previous results, which is similar here. They're building on their own prior work. So the rhetorical class should be Basis.
