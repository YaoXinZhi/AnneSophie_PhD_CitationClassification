Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. First, I need to look at the context around the citation in the given passage. The passage is: "The role of plant health in agricultural productivity has been increasingly recognized. @@CITATION@@ have demonstrated that improved plant health management can lead to significant yield increases. This study builds on those findings by exploring new methods of disease resistance."

In Step 1, I extract the context around the citation. The key part here is "have demonstrated that improved plant health management can lead to significant yield increases." This is the part that references the cited work.

Moving to Step 2, I need to identify the general intent. The citation is being used to show that previous research has found improved plant health leads to yield increases. The current study is building on these findings. This suggests that the cited work is providing a foundation for the current research. The phrase "builds on those findings" indicates that the cited work is foundational, so the intent is Foundational.

Step 3 requires selecting the specific rhetorical class. According to the definitions, Foundational intent corresponds to the "Basis" class. The example given for Basis mentions that the citation is the intellectual foundation. In this case, the cited work's findings are the basis upon which the current study is built. Therefore, the correct label here is Basis.
