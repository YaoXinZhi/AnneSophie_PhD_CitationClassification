Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in the given passage. First, I'll extract the context around the citation. The passage says: "The presence of phytoplasma in the phloem of host plants has been well established in various studies @@CITATION@@." 

So the context is about the presence of phytoplasma in the phloem being established by previous studies. The citation is used to back up the claim that this presence is well-established. 

Next, the general intent here seems to be supporting the current statement with prior research. The authors are referencing existing studies to confirm that their observation isn't new but has been documented before. Looking at the definitions, "Support" is when the citation is used to support or confirm the work of the citing authors. 

Comparing with the examples, the Support example mentions consistency with previous research. Here, the citation is similarly used to show that the presence is well-established, so it's supporting their statement. There's no comparison with other works, no criticism, no motivation for future work. It's just confirming that prior studies have established this fact. 

Therefore, the correct class should be Support.
