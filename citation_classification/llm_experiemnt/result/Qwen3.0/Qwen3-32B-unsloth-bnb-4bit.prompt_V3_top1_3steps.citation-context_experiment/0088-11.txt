Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The given passage is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." 

So the citation here is being used to compare the results of the current study with those from the cited work. The key phrase here is "substantially differ from the results," which directly points to a comparison of findings.

Next, identifying the general intent. The authors are contrasting their results with those previously obtained. This falls under the Comparative category, specifically comparing results. 

Looking at the rhetorical classes, CoCoRes is for comparing or contrasting results or findings. The example provided in the instructions matches this scenario exactly, where the current results are compared to those in the cited paper. 

Therefore, the most appropriate class here is CoCoRes.
