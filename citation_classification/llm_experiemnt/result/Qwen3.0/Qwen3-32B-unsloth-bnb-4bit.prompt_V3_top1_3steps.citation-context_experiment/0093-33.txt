Okay, let's tackle this classification task step by step. The user provided a citation passage and wants me to determine the appropriate rhetorical class from the given list. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." 

Looking at this, the key part is "substantially differ from the results of the experiments..." which directly compares the current study's results with those from the cited work. 

Next, identifying the general intent. Since the sentence is about comparing results between the current work and the cited paper, the intent falls under Comparative. The specific category here is comparing results, so according to the definitions, that's CoCoRes. 

The example given for CoCoRes mentions comparing results directly, which matches this scenario. There's no mention of methods, goals, or explanations here, so CoCoRes is the right choice. No support, motivation, or criticism is evident either. Therefore, the final label should be CoCoRes.
