Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the rhetorical class for this citation. The passage is talking about a study that found conflicting results regarding a branch-inducing phytoplasma in Euphorbia pulcherrima. The example given mentions two studies where one found high concentrations in young leaves and roots, but another study cited here found conflicting results. The citation here is being used to compare these two studies with each other, not directly with the current paper. The example given in the definitions for CoCoXY is similar, where conflicting results between two cited studies are discussed. So the intent here is to compare explanations or claims between the cited works. Therefore, the correct class should be CoCoXY.
