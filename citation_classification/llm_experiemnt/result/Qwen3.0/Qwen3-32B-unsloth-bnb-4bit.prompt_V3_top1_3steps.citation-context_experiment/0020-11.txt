Okay, let's tackle this classification problem step by step. First, I need to look at the context around the citation to understand its role. The passage says, "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." 

So, the key part here is comparing the current results with those from a previous study. The phrase "substantially differ" indicates a direct comparison of results. According to the definitions, CoCoRes is used when the citation is comparing results or findings. The example given for CoCoRes matches this scenario where the current work's results are contrasted with another's. There's no mention of methods or goals here, so it's not CoCoGM. Also, it's not a general comparison between two other studies (CoCoXY) because the focus is on the current work versus the cited one. Therefore, the correct class should be CoCoRes.
