Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. The task is to determine the rhetorical class of the given citation in the provided passage. 

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage is: "The most common symptoms of tomato yellow leaf curl virus disease (TYLCVD) include leaf curling, vein thickening, and stunted growth, as described by @@CITATION@@." 

The context here is that the authors are describing the symptoms of TYLCVD and referencing the citation to indicate where these descriptions were first documented. 

Next, identifying the general intent. The citation is used to provide the foundational source of the information about the symptoms. It's not comparing methods or results, nor is it criticizing or supporting further research. The authors are simply stating that these symptoms were described in the cited work. 

Looking at the options, this seems to fit the 'Basis' class because the citation serves as the intellectual foundation for the current discussion of symptoms. The example given for Basis mentions introducing and validating a method, but here it's about describing established symptoms, which is a foundational reference.

I should check other possibilities. Could it be 'Support'? The example for Support involves confirming results, but here it's more about citing the original description rather than supporting a new finding. 'Neutral' is for neutral descriptions, but the example there is more about stating facts without argument, which is similar, but 'Basis' seems more accurate here because it's about the origin of the information. 

Therefore, the correct class is 'Basis'.
