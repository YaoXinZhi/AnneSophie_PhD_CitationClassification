Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user provided a citation in a scientific passage and wants me to classify it into one of the given rhetorical classes.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@@." 

So the key part here is comparing the current results with those from the cited work. The phrase "substantially differ" indicates a comparison of results. Looking at the definitions, CoCoRes is when the citation is used to compare or contrast results. The example given for CoCoRes is almost identical in structure, talking about differing results from experiments. 

The general intent here is comparative, specifically about results. The other options like Support or Similar don't fit because the text is pointing out differences, not similarities or support. CoCoGM would be about goals or methods, which isn't the case here. So CoCoRes is the most appropriate class.
