Okay, let's tackle this classification step by step. The task is to determine the rhetorical class of the citation marked as @@CITATION@@ in the given passage.

First, I need to extract the context around the citation. The passage provided is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) @@CITATION@." 

Looking at the sentence, the key part is "substantially differ from the results of the experiments..." which directly points to a comparison between the current study's results and those cited. The example given for CoCoRes mentions comparing results directly, so this seems like a fit. 

Next, identifying the intent: the author is contrasting their findings with previous experimental results. According to the guidelines, this falls under Comparative intent, specifically CoCoRes as it's a comparison of results. 

Checking the definitions again, CoCoRes is when the citation is used to compare or contrast results or findings. The example provided in the instructions matches this scenario exactly. There's no mention of methods, goals, or explanations here, so CoCoRes is the correct label here.
