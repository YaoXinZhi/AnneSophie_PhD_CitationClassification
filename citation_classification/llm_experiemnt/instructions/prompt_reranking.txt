#CONTEXT
You are an expert linguistic classifier. Your goal is to rerank the top 3 candidate classes predicted by a model for a given scientific passage. 

#TASK
Review the candidate classes for the discussing the citation @@CITATION@@. Think step-by-step about which class best matches the text's content and intent. Rerank the three classes from best to worst fit based on reasoning. Output only the final reranked list (from best to worst).


Step 1: Reason step-by-step which class best fits this text, considering the intent.

Step 2: Provide a final reranked list of the three classes, formatted as:
Reranked classes (best to worst): 
1. Class_name_1
2. Class_name_2
3. Class_name_3

#CLASS LABELS

Below are the class labels, their full name if the label is abbreviated and a short description :
- Basis : the citation refers to intellectual foundations, 
- CoCoGM : (Comparison or Contrast of Goals or Methods): the citation compares or contrasts goals or methods, 
- CoCoRes (Comparison or Contrast of Results) : the citation compares or contrasts results between the citing work and the cited work,
- CoCoXY (Comparison or Contrast of Explanations or Claims) : the citation compares or contrast  two cited articles, 
- Motivation :  the citation justifies the current research, 
- Future : the citation refers to future work, 
- Support : the citation supports the cited work, 
- Similar : the citation  highlights a similarity, 
- Usage : the citation refers to tools, data, or  techniques, 
- Weakness : the citation criticizes or highlights limitations of the cited work
- Neutral : the citation does not mention cues for classifying the citation passage in the other classes. The neutral citation often refers to background information.
 
Only include in the ranking the classes that are in the Top3 candidates. Return exactly the reranked top3 classes numbered list (1, 2, 3), do not include anything else.

#OUTPUT EXAMPLE

1. CoCoRes  
2. CoCoXY  
3. Neutral
