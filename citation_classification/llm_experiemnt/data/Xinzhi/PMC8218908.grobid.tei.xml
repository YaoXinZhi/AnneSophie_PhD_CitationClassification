at 5 dpi, few DEGs related to sucrose metabolism pathways were detected in VAL under the healthy psyllid infestation, while many DEGs involved in starch and sucrose metabolism pathways in VAL under the CaLas-infected psyllid infestation was identified (Supplementary Material 1, Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">21</ref>).</s><s>Starch and sucrose are coordinately regulated in plants.</s><s>According to the KEGG pathway analysis, surprisingly, the key regulatory enzyme in starch synthesis, ADP glucose pyrophosphorylase, was significantly downregulated in VAL under the CaLas-infected psyllid infestation, as well as two starch branching enzyme DEGs; however, several DEGs encoding starch degradation enzyme were upregulated, such as one alpha-amylase, four glycosyl hydrolase, as well as one sucrose synthase.</s><s>The result indicated that the starch accumulation was not initiated at the very beginning (5 dpi).</s><s>According to the MapMan pathway analysis, we visually observed that most of the DEGs involved in the starch metabolism pathways were downregulated, while several DEGs involved in the sucrose metabolism were upregulated (Supplementary Material 2, Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>).</s><s>This finding further supports our hypothesis suggested above, that CaLas might manipulate the glycolytic pathway for ATP production via sucrose metabolism and starch degradation.</s><s>It is not a surprise that our finding is different from the observation of previous studies that excessive starch accumulated in the phloem sieve elements, because our observation is at the very beginning of the infection process and source-sink allocations development.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSIONS</head><p><s>Taken together, at 1 dpi, the defense response to healthy psyllid piercing and sucking was successfully activated in VAL via RLKs/GLRs-MAPKs-ethylene signaling-mediated systemic immunity.</s><s>However, the defense response to CaLas-infected psyllid infestation was repressed in VAL.</s><s>We speculated that a constantly downregulated DEG (ciclev10014641) encoding RLK was repressed by CaLas secreted effector(s), and/or in conjunction with an RLP encoded by a DEG (ciclev10013722m), which might play a crucial role in the downstream signal transduction.</s><s>Indeed, a DEG (ciclev10021170m) from the MAPK signaling pathway and a DEG (ciclev10028596m) from the CPK signaling pathway were repressed, which further led to the repressed ethylene signaling pathway during the co-occurring attacks by psyllid and CaLas.</s><s>At 5 dpi, VAL responded to the healthy psyllid infestation with a proper mechanism.</s><s>However, a burst of DEGs were identified in VAL in response to the CaLas-infected psyllid infestation.</s><s>The downregulated DEG encoding RSH at 1 dpi might play a key role in the severely downregulated photosynthetic pathways.</s><s>The severely disturbed signaling cascade orchestrated the biogenesis downstream, in which the upregulated ATP biosynthesis might be demanded by both plant defense metabolism and CaLas rapid replication, which further led to an overwhelmed and passive defense reaction in VAL.</s><s>Moreover, in VAL under the healthy psyllid infestation, DEGs involved in P protein biosynthesis (1 dpi) were induced earlier than DEGs involved in callose synthesis (5 dpi).</s><s>However, in VAL under CaLas-infected psyllid infestation, DEGs involved in P protein biosynthesis and callose synthesis were both induced at 5 dpi, which indicated that the sieve tube plugging defense mechanism was repressed by co-occurring attacks by psyllid and CaLas.</s><s>Furthermore, CaLas might manipulate the glycolytic pathway for ATP and molecular building blocks production via starch degradation and sucrose metabolism.</s></p><p><s>Collectively, the data reported in this work indicated that CaLas secreted signals and strongly demanded energy caused the repression of signaling cascade and led to the delayed defense response to the co-occurring attacks by psyllid and CaLas (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref>).</s><s>We speculated that CaLas might have employed virulence strategies to subvert the cell immunity-cell surface receptor and kinases, CPKs and MAPKs, and hormone signaling, and then to manipulate the cell machinery-ATP biosynthesis pathways for energy and molecular building blocks in VAL.</s></p><p><s>Several key genes on those disturbed pathways were addressed, and in-depth further studies on the detailed mechanisms of susceptibility of VAL to CaLas are necessary to confirm these suggestions and to find out feasible solutions in view of a more sustainable citrus culture.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIGURE 1 |</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>FIGURE 1 | Diagram illustrating the rearing and infection of CaLas and the transmission trials.</s><s>Colonies of healthy psyllids were reared on HLB-free curry leaf plants in a growth room.</s><s>CaLas-infected psyllids were maintained on CaLas-infected citrus trees in a growth room at the Citrus Research and Education Center of the University of Florida.</s><s>For the transmission trials, five healthy or infected adult psyllids were put into each respective tissue culture tube when leaves of budwood sprouts began to unfold.</s><s>Tissue was harvested from some of the plantlets at 1, 2, 5, and 10 days post-infection (dpi).</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="3,56.64,193.69,481.92,337.68" type="bitmap" /></figure>
