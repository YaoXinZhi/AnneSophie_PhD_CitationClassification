<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p><s>Phloem feeding insects, which includes aphids, whiteflies, psyllids and planthoppers, feed solely on phloem sap, which contains high concentrations of sucrose (a disaccharide sugar comprising of glucose and fructose).</s><s>Utilizing sucrose as its main respiratory substrate the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, catabolizes 15 -30% of its ingested sucrose in oxidative pathways.</s><s>A larger proportion, close to 50% of the ingested sucrose, is incorporated into aphid tissues <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>.</s><s>While sucrose is the main carbon source for A. pisum, sucrose itself is not transported across the gut epithelium <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>Instead sucrose is hydrolyzed in the gut lumen by an α-glucosidase to its constituent monosaccharides, glucose and fructose <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, and these hexose sugars are transported.</s><s>Although sugar transport plays a critical role in aphid nutrition, the molecular basis of sugar transport in phloem feeding insects is poorly characterized.</s><s>In this study, we address this knowledge gap by testing our prediction that A. pisum uses facilitative transporters belonging to the major facilitator superfamily for hexose sugar transport.</s></p><p><s>The major facilitator superfamily (MFS), one of the largest transporter superfamilies, currently contains 82 families, with each family specific for a group of compounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>Within the MFS, sugars are transported by sugar porter family transporters [transporter classification number (T.C #) 2.A. <ref type="bibr">1.1]</ref>.</s><s>The sugar porter family is essentially ubiquitous and found throughout the tree of life.</s><s>Currently, our best insight into sugar porter function comes from detailed structure and function analyses of human transporters (reviewed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>).</s><s>Human sugar porter family transporters (gene symbol SLC2A, protein symbol GLUT) contain 14 members, which are grouped according to their sequence similarity (GLUTs Class I -III).</s><s>By far the best-described are GLUT class I transporters (GLUTs 1 -4 and 14) and GLUT class II transporters (GLUTs 5, 7, 9 and 11), which mediate equilibrative, energy independent membrane transport of hexose sugars down their concentration gradient.</s><s>GLUT class III transporters (GLUTs 6, 8, 10, 12 and 13) are more recently discovered, as a result of the sequencing of the human genome, and their function is less well-described <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>.</s><s>Predominant sugars transported by human GLUTs include glucose, galactose, fructose, and myoinositol <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Previously, using the initial release of the A. pisum genome sequence (assembly Acyr_1.0)</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> we identified an expanded family of major facilitator superfamily sugar transporters <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>The most highly expressed sugar transporter (according to number of gut expressed sequence tags) was named A. pisum transporter 3 (ApST3, ACYPI004204).</s><s>ApST3 is globally highly expressed in insect tissues and is enriched 2.2-fold in gut tissues, relative to whole insect expression levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>Functionally, ApST3 is a low affinity fructose (K m 47 mM fructose) and low affinity glucose (K m 66 mM glucose) facilitative transporter <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>In a related study by <ref type="bibr">Kikuta et al.,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> putative sugar transporters were identified in phloem feeding insect, the rice brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens.</s><s>Of these, 6 transporters were highly expressed at the gut interface compared to whole insect levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>The N. lugens ortholog of ApST3, designated N. lugens sugar transporter 6 (NlST6, BAI83420) has 43% amino acid sequence identity and 60% sequence similarity to ApST3.</s><s>Transporter NlST6 is enriched ~9-fold in gut tissues, relative to whole insect expression levels and has an uptake profile similar to ApST3, transporting both glucose and fructose <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>Based on gene expression pattern, and substrate selectivity, it likely that A. pisum ApST3 and the N. lugens ortholog NlST6 import glucose and fructose at the gut interface and contribute to carbon nutrition in these phloem feeding insects.</s></p><p><s>Here, in an effort to more thoroughly describe the extent of A. pisum sugar transport at the gut interface we utilize a genome-wide approach to identify sugar transporters and screen for glucose and fructose transport function.</s><s>In this study, using a de novo approach we identify 19 sugar porter family transporters in the latest release A. pisum genome (assembly Acyr_2.0,</s><s>ABLF00000000.2).</s><s>Gene expression analysis reveals that 4 of these sugar porter family transporters (ApST1, ApST3, ApST4 and ApST9) are highly expressed at the A. pisum gut interface.</s><s>When functionally expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae hexose transport deletion mutant (strain EBY.VW4000) only ApST3 (previously described, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>) and ApST4 (described here) functionally rescue the hexose transport mutant.</s><s>We report here the detailed functional characterization of A. pisum sugar transporter 4 (ApST4, ACYPI0010980).</s><s>ApST4 is a facilitative glucose and
