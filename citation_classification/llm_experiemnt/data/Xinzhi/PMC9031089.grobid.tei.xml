<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p><s>The atmospheric CO 2 concentration is increasing year on year due to the use of fossil fuels such as coal, farmland, and factory waste discharge, and the improper utilization of land, alongside human deforestation, especially widespread in tropical forests, causing the concentration of greenhouse gases such as CO 2 to become higher and higher <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>.</s><s>Global climate change has aroused widespread concern worldwide.</s><s>NOAA (2021) reported that the atmospheric CO 2 concentration has risen from 280 µL/L before the Industrial Revolution to 415 µL/L at present, with an annual growth rate of approximately 2.5 ppm in the past five years, and it is expected to reach twice the current level by the end of the 21st century <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Since carbon is the key element in the structure of plants, an increased CO 2 concentration enables faster growth due to rapid carbon assimilation <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>In general, elevated CO 2 concentration affects foliar protein [5], leaf biomass <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, water use efficiency (WUE) <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref>, yield <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>, and, in turn, the production of carbon (C)-based secondary metabolites <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>.</s><s>After analyzing 122 studies, Robinson et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> concluded that elevated CO 2 increased the relative consumption rate of arthropods (+14%) but reduced the relative growth rate (-4.5%), as well as the pupal and adult weights (-5.5%).</s><s>As a vital limiting factor for phytophagous arthropods, the changes in foliar secondary metabolites may have major effects on arthropod performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>Most published documents reported that elevated CO 2 indirectly influenced arthropod performance via the changes in plant chemical composition <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>Under the condition of high CO 2 concentration, the population of Sitobion avenae and Aphis gossypii increased greatly after feeding on spring wheat <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s>Wen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> found that elevated CO 2 can enhance the population parameters of Nilaparvata lugens, including the intrinsic rate of increase (r), finite rate (λ), and net reproductive rate (R 0 ).</s><s>Whittaker <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> summarized more than 30 papers and found phloem sap-suckers to have a complex response to elevated CO 2 .</s><s>For example, there was a phenomenon of positive responses of piercing-sucking insects to elevated CO 2 , such as higher compensation consumption and lower interspecific competition <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>Newman et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> considered that sucking pests' responses to elevated CO 2 are frequently "species-specific", being negative, positive, or neutral.</s></p><p><s>Lipaphis erysimi (Kaltenbach) is one of the most damaging pests of cruciferous crops worldwide, particularly of vegetable Brassicae including cabbage, broccoli, collard, kale, mustard, rape, and turnip <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>L. erysimi has strong adaptability to the environment and reproductive capacity.</s><s>Adults and nymphs of L. erysimi pierce and suck the juice of host plants, leading to the loss of plant nutrients and water imbalance, which reduces the yield of crops and the nutritional value of vegetables.</s><s>Honeydew secreted by L. erysimi can also cause coal stain disease, affecting the quality of products.</s><s>High aphid densities distort actively growing leaves, causing them to curl, forming pockets and folds that offer shelter to the aphids, thus enabling them to escape insecticide treatments.</s><s>L. erysimi is also an important vector of several different viral diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Most published documents focused mainly on the short-term or single-generation responses of L. erysimi to CO 2 enrichment <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>However, few of these experiments examined multiple generations of this herbivorous pest with regard to their response to elevated CO 2 .</s><s>In this study, three successive generations of L. erysimi were reared in current/ambient (400 µL/L), medially elevated (600 µL/L) and highly elevated (800 µL/L) levels of CO 2 concentrations.</s><s>The developmental time, survival, and fecundity of L. erysimi were analyzed using an age-stage, two-sex life table to predict the fitness and potential population damage of L. erysimi, which can provide a valuable reference for the effective integrated control of L. erysimi with the increasing atmospheric CO 2 concentrations anticipated in the future.</s></p><p><s>Insects 2022, 13, 333 3 of 11</s></p></div>
