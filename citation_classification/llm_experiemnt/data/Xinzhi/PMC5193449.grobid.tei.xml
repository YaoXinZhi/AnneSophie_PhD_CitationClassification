pathogen Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CLas), the primary causal agent of Huanglongbing (HLB) or citrus greening disease in the U.S. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>Both ACP and HLB have invaded the U.S. during the last decade.</s><s>The disease was first detected in Florida in 2005 <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref> and subsequently in California and Texas in 2012 <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>.</s><s>In Florida, HLB has caused substantial economic losses totaling more than $4.5 billion from 2006-2012, besides the loss of over 8,000 jobs <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>HLB is currently considered the most devastating disease threatening the viability of global citrus production, and for which there is no known cure <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>Timely and effective control of its vector, D. citri is a key management strategy for reducing the incidence and spread of HLB <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>D. citri is an oligophagous phloem-feeding insect that develops on rutaceous host plants and reproduces exclusively on juvenile foliage (flush shoots) of its hosts <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>.</s><s>Due to the restriction of reproduction on juvenile and expanding flush shoots, it is very likely that flush shoot characteristics and nutritional quality may dictate the reproductive potential of D. citri including mating, egg maturation and successful immature development.</s><s>Flush shoots of citrus and other rutaceous host plants of D. citri often exhibit distinct morphological changes during growth and development <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>Such ontogenetic changes are typically associated with variations in physicochemical properties such as texture and chemical composition of leaf tissue and phloem sap of the flush shoots <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, gaining an understanding of D. citri life cycle in relation to ontogenetic changes in flush shoot characteristics can shed light on the nutritional requirements of D. citri and elucidate the factors governing its population fluctuations and dispersal behavior.</s></p><p><s>The spread of vector-transmitted pathogens in plants depends not only on the ability of the vector to acquire and transmit the pathogen, but also on its mobility <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and its overall fitness.</s><s>The reproductive potential and abundance of herbivorous insects are dependent upon their host plant's nutritional quality which are in turn determined by ontogenetic changes in plant physicochemical characteristics such as anatomical and tissue chemical (e.g.</s><s>allelochemical and nutrient) composition <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>.</s><s>Nutritional ecology studies of many phytophagous insects have demonstrated the importance of nitrogenous compounds on their survival, growth, development and reproductive parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref

acids constitute the main nitrogen source in phloem sap <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>.</s><s>Phloem sap of mature leaves of plants is generally rich in carbohydrates but poor in amino acids and possibly also micronutrients <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>.</s><s>As a consequence, many phloem feeders ingest vast quantities of carbohydrates in excess of their dietary needs in order to meet their protein requirements which explains the sugary nature of their excreted honeydew <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>While feeding on young shoots of their host plants, D. citri nymphs secrete copious amounts of a sugary tube-like substance covered by white waxy materials <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>ACP adult females feeding on young shoots also produce white excretory substances, but males produce clear sticky droplets <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>Interestingly, these secretions are seldom seen or are less abundant when adults are feeding on mature and fully developed leaves and stems which would suggest marked differences in phloem composition of young versus matured shoots.</s></p><p><s>The chemical composition of phloem sap varies with plant species and cultivars, edaphic conditions, time of day, season, as well as growth stage <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>.</s><s>It is therefore possible that the suitability of phloem sap as a nutrient source may fluctuate accordingly.</s><s>Such changes in phloem sap chemical composition together with changes in physical characteristics of flush shoots from emergence to maturity may explain their differential colonization by D. citri and suitability for immature development.</s></p><p><s>In citrus, young flush shoots are mostly produced during the discrete flush cycles occurring between post-winter dormancy and early fall in most citrus producing states in the U.S. which often correlate with peaks of ACP density <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>It has been shown that D. citri population density on host plants is tightly linked to the presence of young flush shoots on such plants <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, it is plausible that adult D. citri feeding on plant parts that contain the highest nutrient concentrations are more reproductively active, leading to an increase their population densities.</s><s>However, there is a dearth of information on the key plant factors that affect D. citri host suitability.</s><s>Such knowledge is needed to develop efficient alternative management strategies for D. citri based on host plant parameters.</s><s>The current nutritional ecology study was conducted to better understand how citrus flush shoot characteristics regulate D. citri host preference/colonization and population densities.</s><s>Specific objectives were (i) to record and compare the population densities of D. citri life stages on flush shoots of various growth stages for grapefruit and lemon; (ii) to document changes in textural characteristics (firmness or physical hardness) of flush shoots during ontogenesis; (iii) to analyze and quantify leaf tissue nutrient contents and free amino acid concentrations in phloem sap of citrus flush shoots at various growth stages; and (iv) to assess the relationships between flush shoot physical/nutritional characteristics and D. citri population densities recorded on such shoots.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurement of flush shoot hardness</head><p><s>Flush shoot hardness was measured during the fall (September-October) flush cycle.</s><s>Young and mature flush shoots were collected from experimental citrus trees a week after a heavy rain event (~100 mm precipitation) on 15 September 2014.</s><s>Shoots were excised from their point of attachment to the main stem early in the morning, wrapped in moist tissue paper and immediately transported on ice to the laboratory for processing.</s><s>A cohort of 40 flush shoots (ten shoots per growth stage for a total of 20 shoots per cultivar) was individually weighed using an analytical balance (Sartorius CP124S, Data Weighing Systems, Elk Grove, IL).</s><s>Subsequently, 10 young and 10 mature flush shoots for each of the two cultivars were used for hardness measurements.</s><s>Flush shoot hardness readings were made at the base of the petiole of the first leaf using a digital penetrometer (Model Force One FDI Series, Wagner Instruments, Greenwich, CT) fitted with a flat-tipped 'minuten' probe of 0.254 mm diameter.</s><s>Firmness or hardness readings were expressed as kilogram-force (kgf) or the force required for the penetrometer pin to puncture the flush tissue.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Phloem sap analysis for free amino acid content</head><p><s>Approximately 20 g of young and mature flush shoots were collected from each of the two cultivars for phloem sap extraction and nutrient analysis during the major flush cycles of summer (June), fall (September) 2014 and spring (March 2015).</s><s>In preliminary trials, it was determined that it took approximately 15-20 young and four to six mature shoots to yield comparative amounts of phloem sap.</s><s>Therefore, varying numbers of flushes were collected per flush stage due to observed discrepancies in size for each flush stage.</s><s>The EDTA exudation technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> was used for phloem sap extraction since it has been shown to be capable of generating good quality phloem sap for subsequent analysis of proteins, sugars, lipids, RNA, viruses and metabolites in many herbaceous or woody plant species <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s>Briefly, flush shoots were excised at the point of attachment to the main twig using sterilized pruning shears and immediately immersed into 30 mL of 20 mM EDTA solution in plastic vials.</s><s>The vials were then covered with moist paper towels and transported on dry ice to the laboratory to maintain sample integrity.</s><s>Samples were agitated at 100 rpm on a table shaker (Innova 2300 Platform Shaker, New Brunswick Scientific, Enfield, CT) in a dark, temperature (21˚C) controlled room for 3 hrs.</s><s>The leaves were retrieved from the EDTA solution and the resulting EDTA-phloem sap extracts were transferred into sterile 50 mL centrifuge tubes and stored at -80˚C until further processing.</s><s>Prior to free amino acid analysis, tubes containing the frozen phloem sap solutions were retrieved, uncapped, and freeze-dried for 96 hrs.</s><s>using a benchtop lyophilizer (Model: BT48, Millrock Technology, Kingston, NY).</s><s>The dry weight of phloem exudate in each tube was recorded and samples were again placed in the -80˚C freezer until further analysis.</s><s>Free amino acid analysis was conducted on the dried phloem exudates at the University of Missouri-Columbia Experimental Station Chemical Laboratories (Columbia, MO).</s><s>The freeze dried samples were re-suspended in 2 mL of 0.01N HCl and a 50 μL aliquot of each solution was analyzed for amino acids using a High-Speed Amino Acid Analyzer (Model: L-8900, Hitachi Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and following the methods previously described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Deyl (1986)</ref>, Le <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Boucher (1997)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Fekkes (1996)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</s></p></div>

Mineral analyses were performed at a commercial laboratory operated by the Soil, Water and Forage Testing Laboratory (Texas A&amp;M University, College Station, TX).</s><s>Leaf samples were analyzed for nitrogen by the Kjeldahl method and for other nutrients by inductively-coupled plasma emission (ICPE) spectroscopy.</s><s>Carbon content was analyzed using a CHN analyzer.</s><s>Three samples were analyzed for young and mature flush stages for grapefruit and lemon during each of the major flush cycles of summer (June) and fall (September) 2014 and of spring (March 2015) for all minerals with the exception of C for which only one sample was analyzed.</s></p><p><s>Asian citrus psyllid population monitoring D. citri population densities were recorded fortnightly on 20 randomly selected flush shoots per tree from four of the five experimental grapefruit and lemon trees from May 2014 to May 2015.</s><s>Efforts were made to select 10 young and 10 mature flush shoots during flush cycles when new flush shoots were present.</s><s>In most instances however, only the mature flush shoots were present at any given time during the season.</s><s>Flush shoots were carefully examined and numbers of ACP adults were first recorded per flush shoot.</s><s>Thereafter, numbers of ACP nymphs were counted in situ on the same flush shoots using a 5X hand lens.</s><s>Only the proportion of flush shoots infested with eggs were recorded because enumeration of D. citri eggs on flush shoots was too time consuming.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Feeding preferences of D. citri on citrus flush shoots</head><p><s>Choice tests were conducted to investigate the feeding preferences of adult psyllids on grapefruit and lemon flush shoots.</s><s>Young and mature shoots were excised from trees during the fall flush cycle on 23 September 2014 in the experimental block and immediately inserted into aquatubes containing hydroponic solution (General Hydroponics, Sebastopol, CA) to maintain their turgidity.</s><s>Se ´tamou and Bartels <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> have previously reported higher D. citri populations during the fall flush cycle (September-October) than any other cycle during the year.</s><s>A choice test was conducted to assess the preference of psyllid adults for young versus mature flush shoots for each of the two cultivars.</s><s>Similarly, a host preference test was conducted using flush shoots of the same growth stage (young or mature).</s><s>Thus, four separate tests were conducted under illumination (~50 μmol m -2 s -1 ) in the laboratory following the protocol previously described by Se ´tamou et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</s><s>Briefly, for each test, clear glass desiccators (Secador Techni-Dome 360 Vacuum Desiccator, Bel-Art Products, <ref type="url" target="http://www.belart.com">www.belart.com</ref>)</s><s>with a perforated circular tray to support aquatubes were used.</s><s>Eight flush shoots (four for each the two treatments being tested) were alternately placed along a diameter of the tray.</s><s>A clear-plastic vial containing 10 pairs of mated D. citri adults was placed in the middle of the perforated tray.</s><s>The lid of the vial was carefully removed to allow adult psyllids to freely choose their feeding sites, and the desiccator was immediately covered.</s><s>For each of the four tests, there were 10 replications.</s><s>Numbers of adult D. citri that settled on each flush shoot were recorded after 24 h.</s></p></div>

levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref> presumably due to enhanced cell wall thickening and lignification which are unsuitable for egg-laying or feeding.</s><s>Taken together, D. citri preference for oviposition on younger and softer flush shoot stages may be due in part to the fact that such tissues are still developing in contrast to the

(tryptophan) were significantly and positively related to adult psyllid load during the season (S3 Table ) suggesting their role in host selection and performance.</s><s>As shown in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>, the concentrations of total and essential amino acids were several-fold higher in young versus mature flush shoot stages regardless of host plant or season.</s><s>This observation is consistent with the tissue preference data indicating that young flush shoots are the preferred sites for psyllid oviposition and nymphal development.</s><s>It is plausible that D. citri has co-evolved with its rutaceous host species to precisely time its mating, oviposition, egg maturation and immature development to coincide with the onset of new flush production.</s><s>In general, higher psyllid densities were observed during each flush cycle on both host plants ( <ref type="bibr">Fig 5)</ref>.</s><s>Although total and essential amino acid concentrations were higher in phloem sap during the spring relative to the fall flush cycle (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>), this was not accompanied by concomitant higher psyllid densities in spring as shown in Fig 5 .</s><s>A possible explanation for this disparity could be that the spring flush, though nutritionally richer than fall flushes, follows a long psyllid overwintering period-from November to February under South Texas conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, fewer adult psyllids would be available to initiate reproduction during the spring relative to more abundant adults in the fall.</s><s>Nonetheless, the nutritional content of young expanding shoots seemed sufficient enough to sustain successful reproduction of D. citri relative to mature flush shoots at any given flush cycle season.</s></p><p><s>Results of the D. citri feeding preference study clearly demonstrated that flush shoot growth stage had a stronger influence on psyllid substrate selection than host plant species (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>).</s><s>In previous studies, D. citri population densities have been reported to vary with host plants <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref>.</s><s>Under field conditions in Texas, for instance, some rutaceous hosts such as lemon tend to have more flushes per year than others such as grapefruit.</s><s>In this study, we did not observe a preferential selection between grapefruit and lemon for either young or mature shoots.</s><s>Therefore the observed variation in host-specific psyllid densities under field conditions may be attributed to the frequency and availability of flush shoots rather than host preference.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, the results of this study highlight the importance of young flush shoots in the population dynamics of the Asian citrus psyllid with consequences for vector management.</s><s>The data indicate that both physical characteristics and nutritional composition of flush shoots and their phloem sap are important factors regulating host colonization and reproductive potential of D. citri in citrus groves.</s><s>Therefore, with regards to psyllid abundance in the environment, flush shoot quality in terms of softness and nutritional content matters.</s></p></div><figure
