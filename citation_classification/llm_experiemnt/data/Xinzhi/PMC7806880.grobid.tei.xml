without dsRNA.</s><s>The artificial diet was replaced every other day to prevent dsRNA degradation.</s><s>After 4 days, all surviving morphs from each treatment were selected and divided randomly into three replicates groups, and then transferred to fresh bean leaf discs.</s><s>The collections were done at 24 h and 48 h after feeding on plant to alleviate the adverse effects of the artificial diet on treated aphids and allow the aphids to adapt feeding on the plants.</s><s>Previous studies have shown that RNAi effects can be remained from the parents subjected to RNAi in their progenies <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">59</ref> .</s><s>Abdellater et al. found that RNAi had a prolonged impact and remained significantly effective in the six subsequent generations <ref type="bibr"

trehalase activity analyses at 24 h and 48 h after the 4-day RNAi treatment.</s><s>Trehalase activity was assayed according to the method described by Shen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> , with some modifications.</s><s>Briefly, ten aphids were homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS: 130 mM NaCl; 7 mM Na 2 HPO 4 •2H 2 O; 3 mM NaH 2 PO 4 •2H 2 O; pH 7.0), then centrifuged at 1000 × g for 20 min at 4 ℃.</s><s>Subsequently, 450 μL of the supernatant was centrifuged again at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 ℃.</s><s>After superspeed centrifugation, the supernatant was directly used to determine the soluble TRE activity and protein content, while the sediment was re-suspended in PBS to evaluate the membrane-bound TRE activity and protein content.</s><s>The measurement of trehalase activities was based on the rate of glucose released from trehalose.</s><s>Either the supernatant (TRE1 activity) or the suspension (TRE2 activity) obtained from ultracentrifugation (70 μL) was uniformly mixed with 40 μL of 40 mM trehalose (Sangon Biotech, Shanghai, China) and 180 μL of PBS.</s><s>The mixture was then incubated at 37 ℃ for 60 min and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4℃.</s><s>The resulting supernatant (20 μL) was used to determine the TRE1 and TRE2 activities using the glucose assay kit (Solarbio Biochemical Assay Division, Beijing, China) according to the manufacturer's protocols.</s><s>The protein concentration was determined using the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Sangon Biotech, Shanghai, China) according to the manufacturer's instruction.</s><s>Three replicates were set for each RNAi treatment and the control.</s></p></div>
