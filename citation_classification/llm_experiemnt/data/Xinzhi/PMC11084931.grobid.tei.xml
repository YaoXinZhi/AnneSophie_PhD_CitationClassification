<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p><s>Wolbachia, a group of Gram-negative bacteria, belongs to the group of α-proteobacteria.</s><s>They are matrilineally inherited endosymbionts and are commonly found in a variety of organisms, including insects, spiders, nematodes, mites, and plant nematodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>Wolbachia has the remarkable ability to manipulate the reproductive phenotypes of its arthropod hosts.</s><s>This includes inducing cytoplasmic incompatibility, which is the most common reproductive phenotype in arthropods, as well as inducing parthenogenesis, feminization, and male killing <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>There exist facultative and obligate mutualisms between Wolbachia and their hosts.</s><s>In the cases of facultative mutualism, typically associated with arthropod hosts, Wolbachia can provide a positive fecundity advantage.</s><s>For instance, in Drosophila melanogaster reared on iron-restricted or iron-overloaded diets, Wolbachia contributes to increased fecundity <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>In the context of obligate mutualism, both Wolbachia and their hosts benefit.</s><s>When Wolbachia is removed via tetracycline treatment, it hinders the development, growth, and fecundity of host nematodes.</s><s>In contrast, Wolbachia-free hosts remain unaffected <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>In the case of Brugia malayi, Wolbachia lacks complete pathways for the de novo biosynthesis of essential molecules such as Coenzyme A, NAD, biotin, lipoic acid, ubiquinone, folate, and pyridoxal phosphate.</s><s>This suggests that Wolbachia relies on its host to supply these essential compounds.</s><s>Moreover, Wolbachia in B. malay has the ability to provide riboflavin, flavin adenine dinucleotide, heme, and nucleotides to the host <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>The presence of Wolbachia in insects has been shown to suppress viral replication.</s><s>A notable example is the use of Wolbachia to block dengue, Chikungunya, and Zika virus <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>In the case of plant viruses, such as ragged rice stunt virus (RRSV), the presence of Wolbachia can inhibit RRSV infection and transmission while mitigating virus-induced symptoms in rice plants <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The Asian citrus psyllid (ACP), Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Psyllidae), boasts a wide geographic distribution, with its likely origin traced back to Asia <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>It was initially described in Taiwan in 1907 <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>Over time, D. citri has achieved a global presence and is currently found in various parts of the world.</s><s>It has established a significant presence throughout Asia, and in the 1940s, it was found in Brazil <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>From there, it spread to Florida <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and has since infested most of the citrus-producing states in the United States <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>.</s><s>The Caribbean and the southern regions of the United States have also reported the presence of this psyllid <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>.</s><s>D. citri serves as the insect vector responsible for transmitting CLas, a pathogen that triggers immune responses in the phloem tissue of citrus, ultimately resulting in citrus greening disease, also known as HLB.</s><s>Like many insects, all developmental stages of D. citri are also infected with Wolbachia <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>Recent studies indicate that the presence of CLas may increase the proportion of Wolbachia when compared to uninfected conditions in ACP <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, wDi may play a role in regulating the phage lytic cycle genes in CLas <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s>Unfortunately, currently, there is no known cure for HLB-infected plants <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>.</s><s>The potential interactions between Wolbachia and its ACP host may hold promise for the development of novel strategies for the treatment of ACP and HLB.</s></p><p><s>The intimate interaction between a parasite and its host, coupled with the extensive vertical transmission of the symbiont across host generations, strongly implies a shared evolutionary history between the parasite and its host <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>Candidatus Carsonella ruddii serves as the primary endosymbiont in D. citri.</s><s>Existing research indicates a notable phylogenetic congruence between D. citri and C. ruddii.</s><s>Moreover, genetic markers of the endosymbiont hold promise for exploring the evolutionary history and biogeographical patterns of D. citri <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>Considering the potential interactions between wDi and the host, along with the vertical transmission of wDi, it becomes plausible to utilize wDi as a proxy for tracing the evolutionary history of its host.</s><s>Previously, Saha et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> showed that wDi in Floridian D. citri belonged to a sub-clade of supergroup B different from wDi in Chinese D. citri and suggested that D. citri in Florida did not originate from China.</s></p><p><s>D. citri is a widespread insect that causes significant losses in the global citrus industry due to the transmission of HLB.</s><s>Considering the application of Wolbachia in blocking viruses, wDi has the potential to be used to control D. citri or D. citri-borne pathogens.</s><s>In this study, we conduct a pan-genome analysis of wDi that may facilitate the understanding of wDi-D.</s><s>citri interactions and benefit the development of control strategies for D. citri and HLB in different regions.</s></p></div>
