Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), the biopesticide Csp_P could potentially kill those WCR with homozygous Bt-resistance as well as heterozygotes and delay the development of resistant populations, depending on the concentration and if delivered properly against WCR larvae.</s><s>The lack of cross-resistance with the Bt-resistant WCR strains after exposure to Csp_P is indicated not only by the similar LC 50 values we found (except for WCR Texas), but also by the EC 50 and MIC 50 values (except for the WCR-SUS, mCry-R, and Texas strains), based on overlapping 95% C.I. values (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>It is important to note that even the lowest concentration of Csp_P (1.25 µg/cm 2 ) caused significant growth inhibition in all WCR strains, based on lower dry weight and lower percent of 2nd instar larvae when compared to control (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>It was not surprising that the field derived WCR from Texas exhibited the lowest LC 50 and MIC 50 values when compared to all other WCR strains (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>It is possible that inbreeding depression could explain the strain's increased susceptibility to Csp_P, or it could be related to the genetics of this specific strain collected from maize fields in Texas.</s><s>It is not unusual that some of the WCR strains exhibit slow growth when compared to other strains.</s><s>The WCR diapause larvae (and adults) are usually smaller than most diapausing strains (Pereira, personal observation), and this likely explains the lower larval dry weight observed in control (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We exposed the WCR Texas larvae to Csp_P at 80 µg/cm 2 for 72 h to evaluate histologically and note any symptoms to identify any possible mechanisms involved.</s><s>It is unclear whether Csp_P produces pore-forming toxins, but it appeared to collapse the midgut entirely and dissolve the microvilli in those treated larvae (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>), when compared to untreated larvae (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>).</s><s>Such symptoms were not markedly different from those observed in the WCR larvae following Bt exposure <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> .</s><s>The identity of the insecticidal component(s) of Csp_P preparation is still unknown and is currently being identified and characterized.</s></p><p><s>Sampson et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> have evaluated the toxicity of purified C. piscinae protein against WCR larvae in diet assays, reporting an LC 50 of ~ 60 µg/cm 2 ; this value is two to five-fold higher than the LC 50 values reported in our study for WCR (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>), although they did not report 95% C.I. values in their study.</s><s>In addition, Sampson et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> reported less root damage in transformed maize plants expressing C. piscinae protein when compared to control plants that did not express C. piscinae protein.</s><s>However, toxicity against SCR was not observed nor were NCR larvae tested in Sampson et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> , as opposed to our study that confirmed activity of Csp_P to both species (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Even though they are not directly comparable due to different formulations and purity, the LC 50 values reported in this study for Csp_P in WCR larvae were higher than those values reported for purified Bt proteins, using similar diet assays <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57</ref> .</s><s>Depending on the Bt protein, LC 50 values can vary from 1.60 µg/cm 2 for Gpp/TppAb1 to 6.39 µg/cm 2 for mCry3A <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57</ref> .</s><s>These values are approximately 3-to 18-fold lower than those found for Csp_P formulation, which was not purified.</s><s>Csp_P formulation was also offered to WCR adults mixed with Cucurbitacin in powder or diluted in sucrose, but no mortality was observed at the concentration tested (data not shown).</s></p><p><s>In summary, the biopesticide Chromobacterium Csp_P was efficient in killing WCR, NCR, and SCR larvae from different strains including WCR resistant to differing Bt toxins with varying levels of susceptibility among the three species, and no cross-resistance with Bt toxins.</s><s>Resistance management practices, including crop rotation and the use of products that do not confer cross-resistance, should be implemented to avoid the spread of resistance alleles in those areas with resistance.</s><s>The next steps should focus on determining the corn rootworm active components, testing Csp_P as a seed treatment in plant assays for corn rootworm larvae, on selected natural enemies for an initial risk assessment for integrated pest management, and also on non corn rootworm pests to determine if Csp_P is a broad-spectrum insecticide.</s></p></div>
