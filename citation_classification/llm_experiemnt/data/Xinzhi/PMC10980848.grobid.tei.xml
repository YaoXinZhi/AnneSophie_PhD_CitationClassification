<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Background: The citrus vein phloem degeneration (CVPD) disease is one of important diseases that infects citrus plants and threatens global citrus production and quality due to its severe symptoms and rapid spread.</s><s>In the 2000s, South Sulawesi Province as one of the citrus producers in Indonesia reported CVPD infection.</s><s>To date, it is still uncertain as to whether the citrus production center has already been rid of the CVPD infection, keeping in mind the low prevalence of certified citrus saplings use and sub-optimal management of plantations by farmers.</s><s>Results: Field observation results revealed varied chlorosis symptoms from young to productive cultivation, which certainly makes it appealing to find out the presence of the causative bacterium, as it has yet to be known whether all the leaves with positive chlorosis symptoms carry the bacterium Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus.</s><s>Citrus saplings that appear healthy may carry CVPD pathogens as the incubation period of CVPD pathogens in the host plant spans three to five months.</s><s>Thus, it is necessary to find the right, rapid way to detect the presence of CVPD pathogens in the citrus plant.</s><s>The most effective method to use is PCR as the bacterium Candidatus L. asiaticus is non-culturable in vitro, but it is detectable using 16S rDNA.</s><s>Sampling of leaves with CVPD symptoms was conducted purposively from eight varieties in five citrus cultivation locations, i.e., Pangkep, Sidrap, Bantaeng, Luwu Utara, and Kepulauan Selayar Regencies.</s><s>DNA isolation was carried out following the Genomic DNA Kit (Geneaid) procedure, followed by detection using the specific pathogenic primer pair OI1 (5 0 GCG CGT ATG CAA TAC GAG CGG C 3 0 ) and OI2c (5 0 GCC TCG CGA CTT CGC AAC CCA T 3 0 ).</s></p></div>

Regency.</s><s>In each regency, a district whose majority of residents engaged in citrus agribusiness and in which a citrus development center with the largest potential area and the highest number of citrus trees in the regency was selected.</s><s>The citrus plant age in the five regencies ranged between 5 and 15 years.</s><s>The farmers in the locations conducted citrus propagation on generative and vegetative bases.</s><s>Seed-based generative propagation is typically designated for the sowing of rootstocks, which constituted an important factor in the provision of citrus rootstocks given that in Indonesia it still relies on sowing.</s><s>Vegetative propagation through bud shielding and grafting requires scions and rootstocks.</s></p><p><s>The CVPD disease may vary in terms of symptoms, types, and modes of transmission, and the symptoms may resemble the symptoms of other diseases.</s><s>Based on the observation in the five research locations, the symptoms varied from mild to severe across the citrus varieties and cultivation locations.</s><s>The diagnoses of the patterns of CVPD symptom expressions may also vary for each variety.</s><s>According to, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> there are four types of CVPD symptoms in citrus foliage, i.e., type I (mottling), type II (mild chlorosis with green veins), type III (severe chlorosis with green veins), and type IV (yellowing in the veins).</s><s>However, there are other characteristics of infected citrus trees in cultivation: one yellow shoot or more, infected leaves generating unclearly bordered blotchy mottles, asymmetrical blotchy mottles, thickened leaves with enlarged veins, and possible Zn-deficiency-like symptom followed by leaf-fall and twig dieback. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref></s><s>As pointed out by, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref> CVPD symptoms include blotchy mottle leaf (BML), little leaf chlorosis (LLC), and nutritional deficiency, which typically occur simultaneously.</s><s>The interaction between pathogenic invasion and plant defensive response facilitates typical leaf symptoms. <ref

five regencies in South Sulawesi generally unveiled symptoms such as yellow shoot, yellow-green blotchy mottle leaf, and asymmetrical blotchy mottle patterns.</s><s>The differences in symptoms might be attributed to differences in plant age, attack intensity, climatic condition, and the Candidatus L. asiaticum strain attacking the plants. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48</ref></s><s>They might also be caused by influences from the environment, sapling origins, and variation in disorderly bacterial distribution in the plants. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49,</ref><ref type="bibr"

target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows the detection technique applied to each citrus variety sampled for identifying the presence of Candidatus bacteria.</s><s>The detection of bacterial presence in the symptomatic citrus leaf samples in this study was carried out with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique to amplify the 16S rDNA of Candidatus L. asiaticus.</s><s>PCR is a sensitive, rapid, accurate detection technique.</s><s>It uses the specific primer pair of 011 forward primer and 012c reverse primer to amplify the 16S rDNA of Candidatus L. asiaticus that measures approximately 1160 bp. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref></s><s>8]<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> The results of the PCR detection with the specific primer pair

citrus leaf samples which visually exhibited typical CVPD symptoms turned out to show no signs of the presence of DNA fragments after PCR visualization result amplification, which means that the samples did not contain the pathogenic bacterium Candidatus L. asiaticum.</s><s>This suggests that the presence of CVPD symptoms in citrus plants does not necessarily indicate that the plants are CVPD-infected.</s><s>Transmission of the CVPD disease may occur through the insect vector Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Homoptera: Psyllidae) <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58</ref> or through infected samplings that are propagated by grafting or bud shielding.</s><s>Grafting and bud shielding are highly effective in transmitting the bacterium Candidatus L. asiaticus.</s><s>It is challenging to monitor the mobility or traffic of planting materials from one area to another area, opening up the chance of CVPD infections.</s><s>The samples from three locations were found to be positive for CVPD infection, which probably was caused by disease transmission during propagation by bud shielding/grafting, in which case the shoots were probably extracted from infected parent plants and carried from infected places, <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref> given that no vector insects were found in the

Mandarin (cv.</s><s>Batu 55), were also detected as CVPD-positive based on PCR detection.</s><s>Thus, there was a high likelihood that infection occurred during propagation by bud shielding/grafting, or it was feared that the saplings distributed by local farmers were already CVPD-infected.</s><s>Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> discovered that five of six citrus varieties in Taro Village, Gianyar, Bali, Indonesia were CVPD-infected.</s><s>This location is a new citrus cultivation area which previously was reported to be CVPD-free.</s><s>It is assumed that the CVPD infection of the citrus plants in this location originated from propagation in another region that had already been infected.</s><s>In addition, in the five research locations, a number of drawbacks that might threaten the sustainability of the citrus agribusiness were found: persistent bad-quality sapling traffics took place between production centers, the distribution of propagation materials from disease-free parent trees all the way to farmers did not follow the national standard flow, there was a difficulty in accessing rootstocks and scions which led to procurement from other areas and overdependence on sapling producers, and the saplings procured were at times short of the standard.</s><s>The CVPD control program has grown in complexity as it requires integrated implementation due to the complex interaction between host plants, pathogenic bacteria, insect vector behavior, and farmer habit or behavior in citrus cultivation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62</ref></s></p></div>
