<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Rice stripe virus-infected females of the small brown planthopper (SBPH, Laodelphax striatellus) usually lay fewer eggs with a longer hatch period, low hatchability, malformation and retarded or defective development compared with healthy females.</s><s>To explore the molecular mechanism of those phenomena, we analyzed the differential proteomics profiling of the ova between viruliferous and healthy female insects using an isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) approach.</s><s>We obtained 147 differentially accumulated proteins: 98 (66.7%) proteins increased, but 49 (33.3%)</s><s>decreased in the ova of the viruliferous females.</s><s>RT-qPCR was used to verify the 12 differential expressed proteins from iTRAQ, finding that trends in the transcriptional change for the 12 genes were consistent with those at the proteomic level.</s><s>Differentially expressed proteins that were associated with meiosis (serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 2B and cyclin B3) and mitosis (cyclin B3 and dynein heavy chain) in viruliferous ova may contribute to low hatchability and defective or retarded development.</s><s>Alterations in the abundance of proteins involved in the respiratory chain and nutrition metabolism may affect embryonic development.</s><s>Our study begins to explain macroscopical developmental phenomena and explore the mechanisms by which Rice stripe virus impacts the development of SBPH.</s></p><p><s>The small brown planthopper (SBPH, Laodelphax striatellus), an important field pest, can seriously harm grain crops such as rice, not only by sucking the sap of gramineous plants, but also by transmitting several viruses, including Rice stripe virus (RSV), Rice black-streaked dwarf virus and Maize rough dwarf virus, which can lead to more significant yield losses after virus infection 1 .</s><s>For example, rice stripe disease caused by RSV commonly causes about 20-30% losses in japonica rice-grown regions of China 2 .</s><s>An epidemic of rice black-streaked dwarf disease affected 11.79 × 10 4 ha in Jiangsu Province from 1991 to 2002 and then expanded into adjacent provinces such as Shandong and Henan 3 .</s><s>Maize rough dwarf disease in Spain led to an average loss of 24% in commercial maize fields infected with the virus, up to 68% in areas with the highest incidence 4 .</s><s>Among the three viruses, only RSV can be transmitted from the ovary into the eggs with high efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> .</s></p><p><s>RSV is transmitted by SBPH in a circulative, persistent and propagative manner and maternally from the ovary into 75% to 100% of the eggs, but it has not been detected in sperm 6 .</s><s>When SBPH feeds on RSV-infected plants, RSV moves with the plant sap into the alimentary canal of the insect, infects the gut epithelial cells of the promesenteron where RSV replicates abundantly, then spreads into the adjacent epithelial cells and enteric muscle layer.</s><s>It is then released into the hemolymph and, ultimately, infects the salivary glands and is released into the salivary ducts from where it can be transferred to new plants via the saliva released during feeding 5 .</s><s>To infect the egg, RSV invades the nurse cell of the germarium through endocytosis mediated by a vitellogenin receptor and eventually enters the eggs 7 .</s><s>These complex transmission and multiplication processes of the virus, recruiting of critical host proteins, likely influence the physiological and developmental processes of the insect <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Many previous studies have shown that the infection by plant viruses impacts herbivorous vector insects in numerous ways.</s><s>When Barley yellow dwarf viruses, vectored by the English grain aphid (Sitobion avenae), infect the aphid, the insect lives longer, produces more offspring and develops faster than the healthy insect 10 .</s><s>However,</s></p></div>

meiosis prophase I and suspended in its metabolism and cell cycle until the insect ovulates <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> .</s><s>The eggs are reactivated by mechanical stimulation and hydration resulting from passage of the egg within the narrow oviducts.</s><s>First, they complete meiosis, and the male and female pronuclei become integrated to form the zygote, which then undergoes rapid cleavage cycles in which the nucleus divides without cytokinesis.</s><s>These processes, from the end of prophase I to the rapid cleavage cycle 13, still use the maternal mRNA and proteins; zygotic transcription does not occur until the mid-blastula transition (MBT), when the divided nucleus becomes separated by a membrane and independent cells form <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> .</s><s>Considering these processes in the context of the results of our study, we deduced that meiosis in viruliferous ova is likely to be disturbed by the decreased level of
