<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Background: The Australian citrus industry remains one of the few in the world to be unaffected by the African and the Asian citrus psyllids, Trioza erytreae Del Guercio and Diaphorina citri Kuwayama, respectively, and the diseases their vectored bacteria can cause.</s><s>Surveillance, early detection, and strict quarantine measures are therefore fundamental to safeguard Australian citrus.</s><s>However, long-term targeted surveillance for exotic citrus pests can be a time-consuming and expensive activity, often relying on manually screening large numbers of trap samples and morphological identification of specimens, which requires a high level of taxonomic knowledge.</s><s>Methods: Here we evaluated the use of non-destructive insect metabarcoding for exotic pest surveillance in citrus orchards.</s><s>We conducted an 11-week field trial, between the months of December and February, at a horticultural research farm (SuniTAFE Smart Farm) in the Northwest of Victoria, Australia, and processed more than 250 samples collected from three types of invertebrate traps across four sites.</s><s>Results: The whole-community metabarcoding data enabled comparisons between different trapping methods, demonstrated the spatial variation of insect diversity across the same orchard, and highlighted how comprehensive assessment of insect biodiversity requires use of multiple complimentary trapping methods.</s><s>In addition to revealing the diversity of native psyllid species in citrus orchards, the non-targeted metabarcoding approach identified a diversity of other pest and beneficial insects and arachnids within the trap bycatch, and recorded the presence of the triozid Casuarinicola cf warrigalensis for the first time in Victoria.</s><s>Ultimately, this work highlights how a non-targeted surveillance approach for insect monitoring coupled with non-destructive DNA metabarcoding can provide accurate and high-throughput species identification for biosecurity and biodiversity monitoring.</s></p></div>

Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>), possibly working as a DNA extraction and PCR inhibitor.</s><s>The 15.34% of ground trap samples failing library preparation is a striking contrast to the 9% of wind trap samples that failed and, only 1.51% of Sentinel trap samples, with the latter generally related to low number of insect specimens present in the sample.</s><s>Sample condition is extremely important for insect metabarcoding analysis, especially when applied to high throughput biosecurity surveillance, where commonly a high volume of samples need to be rapidly processed.</s><s>In this context, having to repeat DNA extraction or PCR delays the generation of time-sensitive data and impedes any response to pest detections.</s><s>On the other hand, the results presented here show how many ground-dwelling insects are not observed in wind-based traps, making the use of multiple complementary trapping approaches, including ground traps, fundamental for assessing the general insect biodiversity of an area.</s></p><p><s>Differences in insect diversity and species composition were also found between different sites from the same farm, indicating that sampling from a single site is insufficient for characterizing the broader species composition within an area, and may miss pests that are present in low abundance.</s><s>Indeed, despite being only a few hundred meters apart, different areas of the same farm may host different plants and, therefore, different species of insects associated with them.</s><s>Ground traps placed near the strip of native vegetation at site 4 collected the highest diversity of insects across the 11 weeks, while on the other hand similar composition of the wind traps could be observed across all sites.</s><s>This can probably be explained by the fact that insect diversity collected by passive wind traps almost entirely depends on the wind.</s><s>Since this trap is not actively aspirating insects, most of the strong flyers can probably avoid being captured <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Teulon &amp; Scott, 2006)</ref>, while the insects that are sampled are blown by the wind in similar volumes (and similar diversity) across the whole farm.</s><s>On the other hand, ground traps appeared to collect a more site-specific insect diversity, suggesting that the distribution of ground dwelling insects is more localized.</s><s>Both sentinel and ground traps always collected higher diversity compared to the wind traps at site 1 (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>).</s><s>This result confirms the improved sampling strength of the Sentinel smart trap over previous trap designs, which was also demonstrated in a previous study comparing it to an alternative suction trap <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Martoni et al., 2023)</ref>, but it also highlights the importance of ground traps as a complementary method.</s><s>From a pest surveillance and biosecurity perspective, the results obtained here highlight the importance of understanding the ecology and biology of the insects targeted, since not only different traps but also different sites within the same farm may produce different results.</s><s>These findings add to the understanding that spatial replication of traps is critical for assessing the presence/absence of species in an area, since single traps are likely to miss taxa, especially at low population levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Berec et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Montgomery et al., 2021)</ref>.</s></p></div>

Hebert, 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Being able to obtain a DNA sequence for these insufficiently identified taxa can allow them to be linked across studies, localities and time, and eventually barcoded or described.</s><s>For example, we recorded here a specimen belonging to the genus Toya (Hemiptera: Delphacidae) that matched (100%) a sequence generated from a taxon recorded on Barrow Island, one of Western Australia's most important conservation reserves <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Gopurenko et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Another instance was a Mesocentrus species (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) previously recorded in Tasmania and included in a phylogenetic work on the braconid subfamily Rogadinae <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Quicke et al., 2021)</ref>.</s><s>By investigating bycatch taxa in this manner, DNA metabarcoding provides a very powerful tool for ecological research, not only capable of identifying target and non-target species, but also of determining the diversity and distribution of taxa within a region, even if these may be new to science <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Buchner et al., 2023)</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSIONS</head><p><s>The high-throughput metabarcoding approach used in this study enabled comparisons between different trapping methods used for biosecurity and ecological surveillance, revealing differences in the number, diversity, and species composition of trapped insects, with different taxonomic groups preferentially detected by different traps.</s><s>Furthermore, we found that not only the number of traps used, but their spatial distribution across crops and proximity with the orchard's edges can influence the insect diversity captured.</s><s>This highlights how accurately detecting pest species as well as obtaining reliable measurements of insect diversity both heavily depend on the trapping method used, the number of replicate traps deployed, and the spatial distribution of these traps, even when monitoring a single farm.</s><s>This also underscores the importance of appropriate trap selection during the experimental design phase, always considering which trap may be better suited to capture the target species within the environment that is being sampled.</s><s>Furthermore, the first record of Casuarinicola cf warrigalensis in Victoria demonstrates how non-destructive insect metabarcoding can be extremely accurate in recording potential exotic species, even when these are not expected to be found in a given location (and therefore often not targeted by conventional surveillance techniques).</s><s>However, our study also highlighted the importance of comprehensive and curated DNA reference databases, the lack of which may result in mistakenly attributing a DNA sequence to the wrong species.</s></p><p><s>We recommend further collection and sequencing of poorly represented taxa, in cooperation with expert taxonomists, in order to improve taxonomic identification using metabarcoding and other molecular approaches.</s><s>Until then, with the vast majority of insect groups being understudied and/or scarcely represented on public nucleotide databases, non-destructive DNA extraction methods remain of paramount importance for validating molecular results and confirming taxonomical identifications with traditional morphological examination.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure1Map of trial location at the SuniTAFE Smart Farm (Meringa, Victoria, Australia).</s><s>Each site had a wind trap and four ground traps, while site 1 also had an iMapPESTS Sentinel smart trap.</s><s>Site 1 was the car park of the farm (1), site 2 was between a citrus and an avocado orchard (2), site 3 was surrounded by citrus (3), and site 4 was on the margin of a native bush strip (4).</s><s>Maps were generated using Google Earth v 7.3.6.9345</s><s>(Google, CA, USA).Full-size  DOI: 10.7717/peerj.15831/fig-1</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="5,186.86,87.71,295.48,410.12" type="bitmap" /></figure>
