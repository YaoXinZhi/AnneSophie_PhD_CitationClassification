G.Don (Gentianales: Apocynacae), supports CLas replication and growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> even though it is a non-host of D. citri.</s><s>CLas also readily multiplies within the hemolymph and body of D. citri <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, indicating further complexity of the HLB pathosystem.</s><s>Based on observed differential CLas responses reported in numerous <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref> studies, it is reasonable to postulate that phloem saps of CLas -permissive hosts (i.e.</s><s>Citrus spp.</s><s>and periwinkle) as well as D. citri hemolymph and tissue contain unique growth factors that facilitate CLas replication.</s><s>Contrariwise, phloem saps of non-permissive plants (i.e.</s><s>Murraya spp.) may contain CLas -suppressing factors.</s><s>Since CLas is a yet-to-be-cultured fastidious bacterium <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, it is important to gain a better understanding of potential factors regulating its growth and replication.</s></p><p><s>Most bacteria have limited metabolic capabilities and mainly depend on their hosts for energy and growth substrates <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>The fastidious nature of CLas suggests that it likely relies on its hosts to meet its nutritional needs.</s><s>Indeed, an analysis of the complete CLas genome indicates that it has a limited ability for aerobic respiration and is likely auxotrophic for at least five amino acids <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>CLas infection was also reported to differentially affect the expression of heat shock proteins in D. citri adults and nymphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, the observed down-regulation of hexamerin, an amino acid storage protein in insects <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> led Vyas et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> to suggest that CLas may modulate free amino acid (FAA) availability in its host through regulation of expression of amino acid (AA) storage protein genes.</s><s>Taken together, amino acids appear to play a significant role in host-CLas interactions and they may be required for the bacterium host nutritional exploitation, growth and transmission processes.</s></p><p><s>The importance of young expanding citrus flush shoots for CLas acquisition <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref> and transmission <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref> by D. citri has been well documented.</s><s>It has also been shown that the phloem sap of young and expanding citrus flush shoots contain significantly greater numbers and concentrations of individual amino acids than mature shoots <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>While the amino acid composition of citrus phloem sap <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>, periwinkle <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, psyllid hemolymph <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> and the non-citrus Rutaceae orange jasmine and curry leaf <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> have been documented, it is unclear how the AA profiles of CLas -permissive hosts and non-permissive Rutaceae plants compare to each other.</s></p><p><s>To address these knowledge gaps, the goal of this study was to perform a comparative analysis of amino acid profiles of CLas -permissive hosts and non-permissive Rutaceae plants to identify key amino acids that may act as CLas growth promoting and/or suppressing factors.</s><s>Such CLas -promoting, host-encoded amino acids may be utilized for in vitro culturing of the bacterium or exploited for HLB management.</s><s>In addition, putative discriminating AAs could be harnessed as biomarkers for quick screen of candidate CLas tolerant and/or susceptible Citrus spp. in breeding programs.</s></p></div>

to 71% of the total FAA pool of citrus flush shoot phloem sap and showed no significant variation as the shoots matured.</s><s>These six FAAs were also dominant in D. citri nymphs (45%), adults (61%) and periwinkle (75%).</s><s>In contrast, all six FAAs constituted only 9-42% of phloem sap of CLas non-permissive Rutaceae plants (Fig 2).</s><s>Interestingly, a 2 to 3-fold decrease in total

9-16%) whereas no such changes occurred between young and mature shoots of CLas-permissive citrus plants.</s><s>Notably, though abundant in D. citri, glutamine was absent in phloem sap of mature shoots from CLas non-permissive plants and in young shoots of curry leaf.</s><s>The phloem sap AA pool of CLas tolerant/resistant plants was dominated by glycine, serine, threonine phosphoserine, phosphoethanolamine and ornithine with their total concentrations ranging from 31% in young flush shoots of white sapote, to 73% in mature shoots of orange jasmine (Fig 2).</s><s>In contrast, these six FAAs abundant in CLas tolerant/resistant plants constituted only 10-21% of total FAA content of CLas-permissive hosts (Fig 2).</s><s>The agglomerative hierarchical cluster (ACH) analysis was used to group the different hosts into three clusters based on their FAA profiles (Fig 3).</s><s>Cluster 1 comprised both flush growth stages (young and mature) of all three non-citrus plants (curry leaf, orange jasmine and white sapote), and had %52% dissimilarity in their amino composition.</s><s>All CLas-permissive plants (Citrus spp.</s><s>and periwinkle) segregated into cluster 2 (Fig 3).</s><s>Within this cluster, phloem sap FAA profiles of mature shoots of Citrus spp.</s><s>were more similar to that of periwinkle while young shoot phloem sap FAA profiles of the three Citrus species were more similar (only %26% dissimilarity).</s><s>The two life stages of D. citri (nymphs and adults) segregated into cluster 3 with %32% dissimilarity between their FAA profiles.</s><s>Hence, clusters 1, 2 and 3 were designated as non-citrus, citrus and psyllid clusters, respectively.</s><s>FAA-based ACH analysis resulted in the identification of four distinct clades.</s><s>Clade 1 contained FAAs that were dominant in CLas-tolerant/resistant plants (e.g.</s><s>AAAB, phosphoserine, phosphoethanolamine, serine, threonine, citrulline, glycine and ornithine), while Clades 2 and 3 comprised most FAAs present in relatively higher concentrations in CLas-permissive hosts (e.g.</s><s>arginine, proline, GABA, aspartate, asparagine, glutamate and glutamine and the sulfur-containing FAA methionine, cystine and taurine) (Fig 3).</s><s>Clade 3 specifically grouped together FAAs that were the most abundant in D. citri and periwinkle plants such as arginine, aspartate, glutamate, glutamine, methionine and cysteine, among others (Fig 3).</s><s>Clade 4 included FAAs that were present in relatively higher concentrations in D. citri nymphs and moderately present in young flush shoots of Rutaceae plants relative to mature shoots, including alanine, lysine, leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, valine, tryptophan and tyrosine.</s></p><p><s>A heat map describing the association between FAA content of the different hosts was generated.</s><s>To enhance readability of the heat map, FAAs with low variability (i.e.</s><s>interquartile range less than 0.05) were removed from the analysis.</s><s>The heat map grouped the different hosts into two clusters that strongly correlated with their CLas permissivities (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4</ref>).</s><s>With the exception of young shoot phloem sap of orange jasmine, all CLas-permissive hosts had higher proline concentrations relative to non-permissive plants.</s><s>Similarly, CLas permissive hosts tended to have higher concentrations of arginine, glutamine and GABA.</s><s>In contrast, CLas non-permissive plants had higher concentrations of phosphoserine, phosphoethanolamine, glycine, and ornithine relative to CLas-permissive hosts (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4</ref>).</s><s>The ratios of individual AAs were calculated to evaluate the variation in FAA between the two clusters of CLas permissive and non-permissive hosts (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5</ref>).</s><s>Notably, α-amino-n-butyric acid, citrulline, glycine, ornithine, phosphoserine and phosphoethanolamine were present in significantly higher concentrations in CLas non-permissive hosts relative to permissive ones.</s><s>In contrast, CLas-permissive hosts contained 3 to 16-fold more arginine, asparagine, aspartic acid, ethanolamine, GABA, glutamine, hydroxyproline, proline and the sulfur containing amino acid methionine.</s></p><p><s>A supervised pattern recognition method or partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was also used to visualize differences in FAA profiles between the various hosts, between CLas-permissive hosts and non-permissive plants, and to identify specific FAAs that are related to CLas permissivity.</s><s>A clear discrimination was obtained between CLas permissive and non-permissive hosts with the PLS-DA analysis along the first PLS component (Fig 6 ), indicating effective removal of FAA variation not correlated to the two CLas response categories.</s><s>The model discriminating the two CLas response categories had good predictability as shown by a high quality index (cumulative Q 2 = 0.774).</s><s>The cumulative R 2 Y and R 2 X that correspond to the correlation between the FAAs (parameter X) and CLas permissivity group (parameter Y) with the PLS components were 0.58 and 0.99, respectively.</s><s>Simialr analysis using phloem sap FAA of tested plants resulted in similar results (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6</ref>).</s><s>Interestingly, CLas -permissive and non-permissive plants separated quite along PLS component 1, while PLS component 2 discriminated young and mature flush shoots of both types of hosts (Fig 6).</s><s>Hence both the FAA and host data were well summarized by the four components generated with the PLS-DA analysis (S1 Fig).</s><s>The FAAs with high variable importance in projection scores were regarded as contributing most significantly to CLas host discrimination.</s><s>In this regard, twelve (12) FAAs had VIP scores of &gt;1 indicating their importance in discriminating CLas -host status (S1 Fig).</s><s>Based on their correlation values with CLas -host response categories (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>, S1 Fig), these 12 FAAs can be classified as positively (arginine, ethanolamine, methionine, proline, and taurine) or negatively (α-amino-n-butyric acid, β-alanine, citrulline, glycine, ornithine, phosphosethanolamine, phosphoserine and threonine) associated with CLas growth and multiplication.</s><s>The proportion of all FAAs positively correlated CLas susceptibility in CLas-permissive hosts was 41.9% compared to only 8.1% in CLas-non-permissive plants, suggesting that these FAAs may be positively related to CLas growth.</s><s>In contrast, nonpermissive plants had 5.5-fold more FAAs negatively correlated with CLas growth relative to permissive hosts (52% vs 9.5%).</s><s>Using the standardized coefficients of the model relating FAAs to CLas host susceptibility (S1 Fig), it was observed that only four FAA namely, GABA, ethanolamine, methionine and proline were positively and significantly related to CLas-susceptibility with 95% confidence limits not encompassing 0. Similarly, six FAAs, AABA, glycine, ornithine, phosphoethanolamine, phosphoserine and threonine were the only amino acids significantly related to CLas non-permissivity.</s><s>CLas-permissive hosts were characterized by significantly higher proline to glycine, proline to AABA and proline to threonine ratios as compared to non-permissive hosts (Table <ref type="table">4</ref>).</s><s>However, using the 95% jackknife confidence interval as implemented in the PLS-VIP method (Blasco et al. 2015), only two FAAs namely proline and glycine had lower boundaries that did not encompass 1, suggesting that these two variables may be the primary discriminating factors between CLas-permissive and non-permissive hosts.</s><s>Since these two FAAs were negatively correlated (r = -0.82,</s><s>P&lt; 0.001, Table <ref type="table">3</ref>), the derived proline to glycine ratios varied significantly with CLas-host status with lower ratios in CLas-non-permissive relative to CLas-permissive hosts (Table <ref type="table">4</ref>).</s></p></div>
