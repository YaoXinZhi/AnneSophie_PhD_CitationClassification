<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>The curry leaf tree, Bergera koenigii, is highly attractive to the Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri, which vectors the bacterial causative agent of citrus greening or huanglongbing disease.</s><s>This disease has decimated citrus production in Florida and in other citrusproducing countries.</s><s>As D. citri exhibits high affinity for feeding on young leaves of B. koenigii, transgenic B. koenigii expressing bacteria-derived pesticidal proteins such as Cry1Ba1 have potential for D. citri management when planted in or adjacent to citrus groves.</s><s>Importantly, the plant pathogenic bacterium that causes citrus greening does not replicate in B. koenigii.</s><s>Transgenic plants of B. koenigii were produced by insertion of the gene encoding the active core of the pesticidal protein Cry1Ba1 derived from Bacillus thuringiensis.</s><s>The transformation success rate was low relative to that of other citrus, at 0.89%.</s><s>T-DNA integration into the genome and cry1ba1 transcription in transgenic plants were confirmed.</s><s>Transgenic plants expressing Cry1Ba1 differed from wild-type plants, differed in photosynthesis parameters and hormone levels in some instances, and a marked delay in wilting of detached leaves.</s><s>The gut epithelium of D. citri fed on transgenic plants was severely damaged, consistent with Cry1Ba1-mediated pore formation, confirming expression of the pesticidal protein by transgenic B. koenigii.</s><s>These results demonstrate that transgenic B. koenigii expressing bacteria-derived pesticidal proteins can be produced for potential use as trap plants for suppression of D. citri populations toward protection of citrus groves from citrus greening.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cry1Ba1 Impacts Plant Physiology</head><p><s>The transformation rate for B. koenigii was low at 0.89%.</s><s>The transgenic plants produced had a lower growth rate than the WT plants (data not shown), but other morphological traits were similar to WT plants.</s><s>When considering photosynthesis measurements, transgenic plants 6 and 16 were expected to have droopy or wrinkled leaves due to their higher evapotranspiration rates and higher stomatal conductance (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, detached leaves from all transgenic plants wilted significantly more slowly than those from WT plants.</s></p><p><s>Leaf senescence is controlled by various environmental and internal signals that are modulated by the levels of plant hormones <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Woo et al., 2019)</ref>.</s><s>We therefore addressed whether plant hormone levels in B. koenigii transgenic plants differed from those in WT plants.</s></p><p><s>Hormonal analyses of samples from transgenic and WT B. koenigii plants showed that cytokinins tZ and tZR were present at higher levels in leaves of transgenic plants, whereas BA, SA, ABA, and GA4 were present at lower levels (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">6</ref>).</s><s>With respect to their involvement in leaf senescence, ABA <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Sah et al., 2016)</ref>, SA (Rivas-San Vicente and Plasencia, 2011), and jasmonic acid (JA; <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Zhu et al., 2015)</ref> are major promoters of senescence.</s><s>It is widely accepted that cytokinins are involved in maintenance of photosynthetic activity and the delay of senescence <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Wingler et al., 1998)</ref>.</s><s>All promoters of senescence except JA were present in leaves of transgenic B. koenigii plants at lower levels and inhibitors at higher levels.</s><s>These results suggest that transgenic plants are experiencing endogenously induced stress related to the production of Cry1Ba1 and respond by activating processes that can decelerate senescence and/or cell death.</s><s>This response in our transgenic plants is the result of the interaction of gene networks regulated mostly by the cytokinins ABA and SA, but not JA.</s></p><p><s>The levels of GA 4 (one of four naturally active gibberellins) were also lower in transgenic plants.</s><s>The role of gibberellins in leaf senescence is not clearly defined <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Woo et al., 2019)</ref>, but they are known to regulate stem elongation <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Achard and Genschik, 2009)</ref>.</s><s>Reduced GA 4 in transgenic plants may account for their slower growth rate (data not shown).</s><s>Lower levels of BA in leaves of transgenic plants could be tied to the role of SA in the process of senescence because BA is a direct precursor molecule in the synthesis of SA.</s><s>Other phytohormones that were quantified in leaves were present in similar levels in all plants (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">6</ref>).</s><s>The levels of ABA were equally depressed in all transgenic plants (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">6</ref>); this was not reflected in the regulation of stomatal aperture (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>).</s><s>The higher stomatal conductance and evapotranspiration recorded in transgenic plants 6 and 16 were not supported by lower levels of ABA in plants 6 and 16 alone, which points to a role for other processes affecting the cell/leaf physiology of the transgenic plants.</s><s>Future transcriptomic analysis of leaf tissue from transgenic plants would provide greater insight into the effect of Cry1Ba1 on plant cells.</s><s>Notably, in planta expression of a number of bacteria-derived pesticidal proteins has proven similarly  challenging, and the underlying impacts on plant physiology</s></p><p><s>are not yet defined.</s><s>Challenges associated with in planta expression have limited the commercial utility of some bacterial pesticidal proteins in some crop plants.</s></p></div>
