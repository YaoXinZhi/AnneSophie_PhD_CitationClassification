around the infected areas, current policies adopt insect vector control strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12</ref> .</s><s>These include, on the one hand, the reduction of both eggs and insect (Philaenus spumarius) juvenile forms through the mechanical removal of the weeds from March to May, depending on fields altitude <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12</ref> .</s><s>On the other hand, to limit the insect vector spreading in adult phases, pesticides, i.e., acetamiprid, spinetoram, deltametrina, flupyradifurone, are currently sprayed on olive tree crowns.</s><s>The number of treatments and in which months to apply are indicated according to in-field Xfp monitoring results <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12</ref> .</s></p><p><s>The policies just mentioned are strongly suggested in areas not yet infected, but compulsory to all the entire municipal agro of the containment and buffer areas.</s><s>At present, such areas include 43 municipalities, for the juvenile phase treatments and 19 municipalities, for the adult phase <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12</ref> .</s><s>In addition, economic incentives are provided to farmers for uprooting old olive trees and investing in new intensive olive groves.</s><s>Two cultivars, namely Fs-17 and Leccino, have been found tolerant to Xfp upon transcriptome profiling <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14</ref> , thus farmers are encouraged to plant these cultivars.</s><s>However, due to climate change, intensive agriculture is becoming unsustainable in an area affected by increasing desertification processes (Southern Italy).</s><s>Every year, the specific areas regulated by the mentioned policies are updated, depending on Xfp monitoring results.</s><s>However, despite massive tree eradication and use of pesticides following the given policies, Xfp continues to spread.</s></p><p><s>Since olive agro-ecosystem constitutes a very unique evergreen woodland covering an area of about 9.000.000</s><s>ha <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16</ref> in the whole Mediterranean basin, this ecosystem can contribute to climate mitigation and natural resources conservation.</s><s>Through soil protection, enhanced soil retention and carbon sequestration, olive agroecosystem can provide a regulating service.</s><s>Recent literature has demonstrated the capacity of olive groves to act as a sink of CO2 in the trunk, branches and roots as well as in the underlying soil <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18</ref> .</s><s>Fluxes of CO 2 have been quantified in olive grove fields by using Eddy Covariance Tower (ED) measurements <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19</ref> .</s><s>Such carbon sequestration can be increased when sustainable agricultural practices are implemented <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16</ref> .</s><s>Therefore, the recovery of olive agro-ecosystems is of fundamental importance, not only for climate mitigation and the conservation of the landscape consisting in centenarian and millenarian olive trees <ref

municipalities of Cannole, facing the Adriatic coast, as well as in Galatone and Nardò, located on the Ionian coast.</s><s>In the latter municipality, two fields were treated (Nardò A and Nardò B).</s><s>In these fields, a bio-fertilizer, consisting of the zinc-copper-citric acid known as Dentamet was sprayed on the olive tree crowns, once per month from spring to early autumn since 2016 <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Dentamet was chosen after a preliminary evaluation of its bactericidal activity towards Xylella fastidiosa and for its significant systematicity within the xylem tissue of olive trees <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22</ref> .</s><s>Effective systematicity within the plant xylem coupled with a bactericidal activity are required for compounds to control the disease and display a satisfactory activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22</ref> in open-field conditions.</s><s>More recently, the same bio-fertilizer has been directly injected into tree trunks by a novel endo-therapeutic precision intravascular injection system <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25</ref> .</s><s>Such internationally-patented bio-fertilizer can provide a relevant systemic activity within the trees and reduce both the disease symptoms and the Xfp cell concentration within the local cultivar leaves <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25</ref> .</s><s>In addition, upon the treatments, an early reprogramming of some metabolic pathways that re-establish the normal tree physiology has been also found <ref type="bibr"

spraying the Dentamet bio-fertilizer on tree crowns in the Salento area of Apulia.</s><s>Although a number of papers have been reported on Earth Observation (EO) monitoring schemes of restoration actions applied to forest ecosystems, at the best of our knowledge, no papers have been presented on EO monitoring of Xfp restoration actions.</s><s>At present, EO techniques have already been used to monitor only the Xfp spreading across Salento, but no research has focused on Xfp restoration actions.</s><s>Actually, data from airborne imaging spectroscopy and thermography have been used to detect changes in plant functional traits <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26</ref> induced by Xfp spreading.</s><s>Both Sentinel-2 (S-2) and hyper-spectral data, obtained from airplane campaigns, have also been used <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27</ref> .</s><s>Specifically, S-2 data have been exploited to quantify the extension of areas covered by wilting olive trees, while hyperspectral data have been analysed to extract spectral features to identify early symptoms of OQDS caused by Xfp.</s><s>These techniques have revealed Xfp infection before symptoms are visible in olive trees <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26</ref> .</s><s>To validate the presence of the pathogen, all these studies have used in-field samples through the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technique.</s><s>The contribution of Solar-Induced chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) index and the temperature-based Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) retrieved from hyperspectral and thermal imageries, respectively, have been analysed through Support Vector Machine algorithms in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28</ref> .</s><s>The findings have indicated that CWSI can be more useful than SIF for detecting Xfp infection when monitoring large areas.</s></p><p><s>Compared with previous studies focusing on Xfp spreading, our paper aims to use multi-resolution satellite and meteo-data to assess the effectiveness of the Dentamet restoration action as well as support the optimization of the bio-fertilizer dosing treatments.</s><s>To this purpose, first the trends of spectral indices from time series (2015-2020) of freely available HR S-2 data will be analysed at field scale and correlated with meteo-events.</s><s>The index values of olive trees in treated fields will be compared with the ones in untreated fields over time.</s><s>Then, to evaluate the response of different cultivars to treatments, VHR Pléiades indices will be analysed at tree scale.</s></p><p><s>The results obtained from our multi-resolution data will be qualitatively compared with the PCR analysis performed on the same experimental fields <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23</ref> .</s><s>The findings will suggest further Dentamet experimentation on larger areas supported by multiscale EO monitoring.</s></p></div>

performed in July and August (2015-2020 period) when the symptoms induced by Xfp were more evident and dry grass on the soil background did not contribute to the crown index values.</s><s>The results of our study indicated that the spectral index values from HR and VHR satellite images, at field scale and tree scale, respectively, resulted higher than the ones of the untreated trees.</s><s>Specifically, from the multi-temporal HR S-2 time series of June and August, the analysis of NDVI, NDRE, OSAVI, and ARVI evidenced that all indices had a similar trend.</s><s>However, NDVI reported higher values (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>   The authors of a recent paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27</ref> focusing on the Xfp spreading evidenced that ARVI

agreement with the evidence reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32</ref> , where the transient increases in temperature above normal average values (heat wave) could have caused a marked impact
