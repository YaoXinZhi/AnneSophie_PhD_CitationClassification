of HIPV blends are typically specific to the identity of the plant and the attacking herbivore species, conveying detailed information to other members of the ecological community, including natural enemies <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Clavijo McCormick et al. 2012)</ref>, other herbivores <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Ray et al. 2020)</ref>, and even other plants <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Arimura et al. 2009)</ref>.</s><s>A growing number of studies have reported that plants can detect HIPVs from herbivore-damaged neighbors as a warning of possible herbivory and respond by enhancing their defenses <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Karban et al. 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Here, we examine the specificity of plant responses to HIPVs by exposing plants to species-specific HIPV blends induced by three different herbivore attackers and quantifying plant defense activation.</s></p><p><s>Induced defenses against herbivores are hypothesized to allow plants to efficiently allocate resources and activate effective defenses against specific attackers only when needed <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Mithöfer and Boland 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Schultz et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Karban 2020)</ref>.</s><s>Previous studies have documented remarkable specificity in plant responses to different herbivore species <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ali and Agrawal 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bonaventure 2018)</ref>.</s><s>Plants detect herbivory though cues associated with their own damaged tissues <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Tanaka and Heil 2021)</ref>, as well as specific herbivore-associated cues <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Acevedo et al. 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Through these recognition systems, plants differentiate between herbivores with different feeding strategies or guilds-for example, chewing herbivores that cut and remove plant tissue or piercing-sucking herbivores, with comparatively less physical damage, that penetrate plant tissues to feed on phloem or xylem <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Rodriguez-Saona et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Davidson-Lowe et al. 2019)</ref>.</s><s>Generally, chewing and piercing-sucking herbivores induce different plant defenses and corresponding signaling molecules, or phytohormones, as chewing herbivory often induces jasmonic acid (JA) and piercing-sucking herbivory induces salicylic acid (SA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Erb et al. 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Signaling antagonism, or crosstalk, between JA and SA is often observed <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Thaler et al. 2012)</ref>, indicating defense against a particular herbivore can induce susceptibility to a different attacker.</s><s>Despite these broad patterns associated with plant defense against herbivory, different species of herbivores within the same feeding guild can also trigger distinct plant responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(De Moraes et al. 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Chung and Felton 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Sobhy et al. 2017)</ref>.</s><s>Herbivores can also fall under two extreme categories of host-plant range: specialists that feed on plants within one family, or generalists that feed on a wide range of plants from multiple families.</s><s>Herbivore dietary specialization can further shape plant defenses, as generalists are often more susceptible to toxic plant chemicals compared to specialists that have coevolved with these toxins and may require different defense strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ali and Agrawal 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Based on their sophisticated detection systems, plants rely on common defensive strategies for broad classes of herbivores but can also fine-tune inducible defenses to specific attackers.</s></p><p><s>In addition to induced defenses, plants can further optimize their defense investment strategies through priming.</s><s>Priming is the physiological process by which a plant prepares to more quickly or aggressively respond to future biotic or abiotic stresses, typically conferring plants with enhanced resistance <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Martinez-Medina et al. 2016)</ref>.</s><s>Chemical cues associated with herbivory, including herbivore pheromones <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Helms et al. 2013)</ref> and HIPVs from neighboring plants <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Grof-Tisza et al. 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Pashalidou et al. 2020</ref>) can prime plant defenses, enhancing defense induction in response to herbivore attack.</s><s>A limited number of plant volatile compounds have been identified as plant priming cues, including several green leaf volatiles <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Engelberth et al. 2004</ref>), methyl jasmonate <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Karban et al. 2000)</ref> and indole <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Erb et al. 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Notably, these compounds are conserved cues present in the HIPV blends for many plant-herbivore species combinations, indicating ubiquitous volatiles may prime a wide variety of plant species <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Karban et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Kessler et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Zakir et al. 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Recent findings support the idea of low specificity in plant responses to HIPVs, as tobacco plants exposed to HIPVs induced by two caterpillar species, Manduca sexta and Heliothis virescens, showed similar priming responses when challenged by either herbivore species <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Paudel Timilsena et al. 2020)</ref>.</s><s>In contrast, other research suggests HIPV specificity can play important roles in interplant communication, such as sagebrush plants (Asteraceae) eliciting stronger priming responses in their kin compared to unrelated plants <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Karban et al. 2013)</ref> and in local neighbors compared to foreign conspecifics <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Karban et al. 2016)</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, another recent study reported herbivore species-specificity in HIPV production and responses in neighboring plants.</s><s>HIPVs from tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum) damaged by beet armyworm caterpillars (Spodoptera exigua) enhanced neighboring plant resistance to herbivory, but HIPVs induced by whitefly (Bemisia tabaci) damage suppressed neighboring plant defenses and enhanced whitefly performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Zhang et al. 2019)</ref>.</s><s>Despite these advances, our understanding of how HIPV specificity and attacking herbivore identity modulate plant communication remains limited.</s><s>Domesticated plant species in the gourd family (Cucurbitaceae) include several high-value vegetable crops, such as zucchini squash (Cucurbita pepo L.).</s><s>Striped cucumber beetles (Acalymma vittatum F.) and squash bugs (Anasa tristis DeGeer) are specialist herbivores on cucurbit crops and significant agricultural pests in North America <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Doughty et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Haber et al. 2021)</ref>.</s><s>Cucurbits are also occasionally attacked by generalist herbivore species, including highly polyphagous saltmarsh caterpillars (Estigmene acrea Drury) (MNT personal observations).</s><s>Cucurbit plants produce a class of bitter-tasting triterpenoid defense compounds called cucurbitacins <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Da Costa and Jones 1971)</ref>, and these compounds mediate plant interactions with the herbivore community <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Theis et al. 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Generalist herbivores are often deterred by cucurbitacins, whereas specialists detoxify or sequester them for protection against predators and may perceive them as phagostimulants <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Ferguson and Metcalf 1985)</ref>.</s><s>Many domesticated cucurbit varieties, however, lost the ability to produce cucurbitacins or produce only low levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Theis et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Brzozowski et al. 2019)</ref>, and recent studies have implicated plant volatiles as important chemical cues in cucurbit-herbivore interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Shaprio and Mauck 2018)</ref>.</s><s>Indeed, cucurbit volatiles play key roles in herbivore host-plant selection <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Brzozowski et al. 2020)</ref>, plant disease transmission by vector herbivores <ref type="bibr">(Mauck et al. 2010a)</ref>, and natural enemy attraction to host plants to kill herbivores <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Agrawal et al. 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Grunseich et al. 2020)</ref>.</s><s>Nevertheless, few studies have characterized beetle-induced HIPVs in zucchini squash <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Brzozowski et al. 2020)</ref> and none have examined squash bug-or saltmarsh caterpillar-induced HIPVs in zucchini squash.</s><s>Further, whether HIPV-mediated interplant communication occurs in Cucurbitaceae remains an unexplored question, which could elucidate critical information for agroecological interactions between plants and herbivores.</s></p><p><s>The overall goal of this study was to evaluate the specificity of plant volatile communication by characterizing the defense responses of zucchini squash plants exposed to HIPVs from different herbivore species.</s><s>We characterized the HIPV blends of squash plants attacked by three herbivore species: saltmarsh caterpillars, squash bugs, or striped cucumber beetles.</s><s>To determine how these HIPV blends influenced plant priming, volatile "emitter" plants were damaged by one of the three herbivore species or were left as undamaged controls.</s><s>We exposed neighboring "receiver" plants to HIPVs or control volatiles from emitters and then challenged receivers with herbivory by the associated herbivore species.</s><s>As measures of plant resistance, we quantified the amount of herbivore feeding damage and levels of defense-related phytohormones induced in receiver plants.</s><s>Based on predicted HIPV production following attack from herbivores of different feeding guilds, we expected squash plants exposed to HIPVs from chewing herbivores (saltmarsh caterpillars and cucumber beetles) would have enhanced resistance to herbivory, while plant exposure to HIPVs from piercing-sucking herbivores (squash bugs) would have no effect on plant resistance.</s><s>This research highlights additional complexity in plant responses to HIPVs and offers insight into how volatile cues associated with different herbivore species affect plant defense responses.</s></p></div>
