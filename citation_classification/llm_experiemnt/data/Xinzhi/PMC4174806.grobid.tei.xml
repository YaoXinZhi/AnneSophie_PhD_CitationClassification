respectively.</s></p><p><s>Verification of 454 pyrosequencing results using qPCR.</s></p><p><s>To validate the pyrosequencing results of the SBPH transcriptomes, the transcription levels measured

4), which belong to the KEGG functional group of which showed the most significant difference of the transcription level between RVLS and NVLS, were selected.</s><s>Also heat shock protein 1 and 2, and vitellogenin genes were selected for qPCR along with elongation factor 2 (EF2) gene as a reference for normalization <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Tong et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>The cDNA was synthesized from the total RNA of RVLS and NVLS using QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit (QIAGEN, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions, followed by qPCR conducted using EvaGreen qPCR Mastermix (Applied Biological Materials Inc, Canada) and CFX96™ Real-Time System (BIO-RAD, USA).</s><s>The primers used for the qPCR are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>.</s><s>The qPCR results confirmed that the ten isotigs were indeed transcribed in both RVLS and NVLS, and the calculation of the relative transcription levels of the isotigs using 2 -ΔCt method <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Pfaffl, 2001)</ref> demonstrated that the seven genes (vitellogenin, heat shock protein 1 and 2, and ribosomal protein 1, 2, 3 and 4) and the other three genes (translation initiation factor 1, 2 and 3) were up-and down-regulated in RVLS, respectively.</s><s>To calculate fold differences of the isotigs, the read counts of the isotigs in RVLS and NVLS which are the corresponding isotigs of the qPCR experiment were measured in reads per kilobase of exon per million mapped sequence reads (RPKM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Mortazavi et al., 2008)</ref>.</s><s>The sequence reads of the five isotigs (heat shock protein 1 and 2, translation initiation factor 1, 2 and 3) were confirmed in both RVLS and NVLS while the other five isotigs (vitellogenin, ribosomal protein 1, 2, 3 and 4) were confirmed in RVLS exclusively.</s><s>The expression levels measured by qPCR were in a good accordance with the ratios of read counts of the EST libraries (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Rice stripe virus transcripts in viruliferous L. striatellus.</s></p><p><s>The RSV transcripts of three of the seven viral ORFs, NS3, CP and RdRP were confirmed in RVLS, and their sequence read counts were 293, 224 and 5, respectively.</s><s>The total RSV read counts were 522, and this was 0.63% of the total of 83,041 valid sequence reads of RVLS contigs and singletons.</s><s>The low read count of RdRP suggests that the replication of RSV is not highly active in SBPH while NS3 was the most abundant RSV transcript in RVLS which codes for viral suppressor of siRNA <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Hemmes et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>CP was the second most abundant RSV transcript which codes for capsid protein <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Hayano et al., 1990)</ref>.</s><s>Both NS3 and CP are the genes located on genomic and antigenomic strand of RSV RNA3, respectively.</s><s>Therefore the similar levels of NS3 and CP transcripts possibly suggest that the genes in RNA3 are under the same gene expression regulation mechanism, however, qPCR experiments to quantify the RSV transcripts in RVLS need to be performed to prove the hypothesis.</s><s>The 454 pyrosequencing results demonstrated that the next generation sequencing (NGS) technique was able to reflect the characteristics of the transcriptome of RVLS.</s><s>The genes in the RVLS which showed different transcription patterns indicated that the RSV may alter the gene expression of the SBPH which possibly affects the physiology, fitness and behavior of RVLS.</s><s>The up-regulated heat shock protein genes might be one of the examples that the RSV may take the advantage of altering gene transcription to improve fitness of the vector because heat shock proteins play a significant role in generating tolerance to stresses <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Krebs, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Sorensen et al., 2003)</ref>.</s><s>It is also interesting to note that the transcription level of vitellogenin in RVLS was highly up-regulated, which means RSV might modulate the host vitellogenin pathway genes to promote the oogenesis or alter sex ratio of RVLS to facilitate its persistent transovarial transmission via the offsprings of RVLS.</s><s>The highly up-regulated ribosomal protein genes were also the possible consequence of the up-regulation of vitellogenin because the ovarian cells need more amount of translational machinery, however, the down-regulated translation initiation factors are paradoxical because the recruitment of transcription initiation factors is a crucial step of protein synthesis.</s><s>Many viruses can inhibit host translation initiation factors to take over host gene expression by which are usually viral protein mediated protein level interactions, rather than transcription regulation (Walsh and Mohr, Fw: 5' GGACGAATACTGAAGCACACTTGG 3' Re: 5'

Re: 5' GTGACCCTTCCTACCGAATCCG 3' 2011).</s><s>It suggests that RSV possibly can alter the transcription of the genes for cellular translational machinery direct or indirect manner.</s><s>Another example of viral modulation of cell physiology is the major viral transcript NS3, a RNAi suppressor which binds 21 nt siRNA, and it might be a viral strategy to evade defense system of SBPH and rice plant <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Alvarado and Scholthof, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Hemmes et al., 2007)</ref>.</s><s>Early studies on vector transmission of plant viruses demonstrated the specificity of the virus-vector interaction, which says that the instances of the biological properties associated with the transmission process may differ significantly <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Ng and Falk, 2006)</ref>.</s><s>However, the genomics approach to study the virus-vector interaction using NGS technique might contribute to investigate the gene regulation mechanism in the persistent vector insects and the upstream regulation factors, which will be a new approach to study the interaction among the virus, plant, and vector.</s><s>The relative
