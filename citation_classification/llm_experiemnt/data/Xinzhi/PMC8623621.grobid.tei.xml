<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Nowadays, citrus greening or Huanglongbing is considered the most destructive disease in the citrus industry worldwide.</s><s>In the Americas and Asia, the disease is caused by the putative pathogen, 'Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus' and transmitted by the psyllid vector, Diaphorina citri.</s><s>It has been shown that volatile organic compounds (VOC) that are released from citrus leaves attract the psyllid vector.</s><s>Herein, we tested whether the rootstock influenced the stored VOC profile in the scion leaves and if these influences were altered after infestation with D. citri.</s><s>The VOC profiles of the hexane-extracted leaves of the mandarin hybrid 'Sugar Belle' that were grafted on three different rootstocks (C-35, sour orange (SO), and US-897) with and without infestation with D. citri were studied.</s><s>The GC-MS analysis showed that the scion VOC profiles of the non-infested control trees were similar to each other, and rootstock was not a strong influence.</s><s>However, after one month of infestation with D. citri, clear differences in the scion VOC profiles appeared that were rootstock dependent.</s><s>Although the total scion leaf VOC content did not differ between the three rootstocks, the infestation increased scion monoterpenes significantly on US-897 and C-35 rootstock, increased terpene alcohols on US-897 and SO rootstock, and increased sesquiterpenes on SO.</s><s>Infestation with D. citri significantly reduced fatty acids and fatty acid esters across all of the rootstocks.</s><s>Therefore, our results suggest that rootstock choice could influence scions with an inducible volatile defense by enhancing the amounts of VOCs that are available for repelling vectors or for signaling to their natural enemies or parasitoids.</s><s>According to this study, US-897 may be the best choice among the three that were studied herein, due to its diverse and robust VOC defense response to infestation with D. citri.</s></p></div>

volatile profile <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr">16]</ref>.</s><s>As the leaves are the landing, feeding, and reproduction sites for Diaphorina citri, the vector of HLB, determining whether rootstock choice has any influence on leaf volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that could be exploited to repel or deter D. citri could be beneficial.</s></p><p><s>Huanglongbing (HLB), or citrus greening disease, was first discovered in southern China in 1919 <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, and has spread to many citrus growing regions including Brazil and the U.S. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>.</s><s>In Florida, HLB has been responsible for a decline of 71% in citrus production for the 2016-2017 season compared to 2000-2001 levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>The putative pathogen of HLB is a Gram-positive, phloem-limited α-proteobacteria known as 'Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus', which is transmitted by the Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri Kuwayama [Hemiptera: Liviidae] <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>.</s><s>D. citri transmits the bacterium from tree to tree while it feeds on the phloem sap of infected citrus trees, and currently, no effective cure is available.</s><s>The diseased trees produce a low yield of unevenly ripened, lopsided, and bitter fruit, followed by early tree death <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>.</s><s>The fruit from sweet orange trees such as 'Valencia' and 'Hamlin' are processed into orange juice, and make up the majority of the Florida citrus acreage <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>Unfortunately, these widely planted varieties are particularly susceptible to HLB disease, with many Florida groves reaching 100% infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>The choice of rootstock can play a role in many horticultural traits such as tree size, fruit yield, and fruit quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, as well as tolerance to salinity <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>.</s><s>A recent survey of 'Hamlin' on 32 rootstocks in two locations with different soil types showed that the rootstock choice affected the severity of HLB foliar disease symptoms and sturdiness under storm-force winds <ref type="bibr">[31]</ref>.</s><s>However, BowmanandAlbrecht <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> propagated 'Valencia' sweet oranges on 11 rootstocks in a greenhouse setting, and found that only a few parameters such as leaf surface area and root susceptibility to 'Ca.</s><s>L. asiaticus' were influenced by rootstock.</s><s>No significant differences were found in the bacterial titer in the leaves after graft-inoculation with 'Ca.</s><s>L. asiaticus', and both the leaf size and number were reduced in all of the seedlings after infection regardless of rootstock <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Vector control has become the primary weapon for combatting HLB disease, mostly through chemical means.</s><s>Biological control with the parasitic wasp, Tamarixia radiata, has also gained some success <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</s><s>Enhanced citrus nutrition programs to maintain tree productivity have met with mixed results <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, and the development of molecular tools such as interference RNA (RNAi) against D. citri are promising, but face practical hurdles outside of the laboratory <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>.</s><s>Finally, many growers have removed heavily diseased trees hoping to replace them with disease-free tolerant varieties, but truly tolerant citrus varieties are still lacking.</s><s>In 2009, the University of Florida IFAS/CREC cultivar improvement team released many mandarin hybrids including the 'Sugar Belle' mandarin hybrid, previously known as LB8-9 ['Clementine' mandarin (Citrus reticulata) × 'Minneola' tangelo (Citrus × Tangelo), 'Duncan' grapefruit (Citrus paradise) × 'Dancy' tangerine (Citrus reticulata)].</s><s>Recently published data on the field trials of these new releases suggested that the growth and yield were vigorous in Sugar Belle mandarin trees even in the presence of HLB symptoms, which indicated that it could be tolerant to HLB disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</s><s>In greenhouse and semi-field experiments, we found that the Sugar Belle mandarin was high in many secondary metabolites including phenolic compounds, which could act as antibacterial agents, as well as sugar alcohols, which could protect it from stress during pathogen attack <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>.</s><s>We found that Sugar Belle was high in several leaf volatiles such as thymol, β-elemene, and β-caryophyllene, which are known for their anti-microbial activity.</s><s>These results were obtained from Sugar Belle scions on UF-15 and 'Carrizo' rootstocks, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref>, but these were not comparative studies.</s><s>Taken together, however, these data indicate that citrus leaf volatiles could play a major role in tolerance against the 'Ca.</s><s>L. asiaticus' pathogen.</s></p><p><s>Among the many roles of leaf volatiles are those of attracting pollinators, repelling herbivores, or attracting their natural predators.</s><s>Induction of terpenoids as a plant defense following insect herbivory has been widely reported in both annual and perennial crop plants including corn <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, citrus <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, peach <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, and pear <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>.</s><s>Psyllid-infested pear trees produced more limonene, α-farnesene, and δ-cadinene after infestation, as well as green leaf volatiles such as (Z)-3-hexen-1-yl acetate and (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>.</s><s>Peach trees that were infested with the green peach aphid released higher levels of β-ocimene, α-and β-farnesene, and E-nerolidol <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>.</s><s>Many VOCs also stimulate the volatile defenses of nearby plants (defensive priming) or act as kairomones for attracting the natural predators or parasitoids of the target pest, demonstrating complex inter-trophic relationships between plants and their pests <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>.</s><s>For example, sour orange trees that were infested with the two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae, showed increased levels of herbivore-induced volatiles in-cluding α-pinene and 2-ethyl-1-hexanol, and also induced neighboring un-infested 'Cleopatra' mandarin trees to produce similar defensive volatile compounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>.</s><s>In rice, the herbivore-induced linalool and β-caryophyllene attracted predators and parasitoids of leafhoppers <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>, while in citrus, d-limonene and β-ocimene attracted the parasitoid of Thaumatotibia leucotreta, a pest of citrus in Africa <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In our earlier work comparing the leaf volatile organic compounds (VOCs) of 14 citrus varieties [16], we found that citrus cultivars that were considered relatively tolerant to HLB such as Carrizo citrange and Citrus latipes contained higher amounts of volatiles than the susceptible cultivars, especially those known for their antimicrobial activities, such as sesquiterpenes and aldehydes.</s><s>Herein, we hypothesize that rootstock influences the VOC biosynthesis in scion leaves leading to an alteration of the VOCs profile.</s><s>We expect that this alteration might be more pronounced after the infestation with D. citri.</s><s>To test this hypothesis, we investigated the leaf VOCs of Sugar Belle that was grafted onto three locally available and popular rootstocks, C-35, US-897, and sour orange, with and without infestations of D. citri, the vector of HLB.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p><s>With the epidemic spread of HLB in the United States, as well as in many citrus producing countries, there is an urgent need to provide growers with commercial citrus cultivars that are more tolerant to HLB, such as the Sugar Belle mandarin.</s><s>Current field trials that are evaluating HLB tolerance mostly rely on already infected trees or new plantings that are exposed randomly to field populations of D. citri.</s><s>Controlling the exposure to psyllids in a greenhouse or in semi-field conditions could help elucidate and optimize the plant defense response of many rootstock/scion combinations.</s><s>Identifying those combinations with the strongest defense response against D. citri can then be field-tested.</s><s>The evidence found thus far suggests that the scions with an inducible volatile defense perform better against infestations by releasing VOCs which directly repel phytophagous insects or which signal to their natural enemies or parasitoids.</s><s>According to this study, US-897 may be the best choice among the three rootstocks that were studied herein due to its diverse and robust VOC defense response to infestation with D. citri.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1.</s><s>Principal component analysis of the volatile organic compounds (hexane-extracted) from the leaves of the Sugar Belle mandarin hybrid on three different rootstocks (A) control trees (noninfested), (B) one month after infestation with Diaphorina citri, and (C) both control trees and D. citri-infested trees shown together in the same PCA.</s><s>The PCA plots show that the Sugar Belle leaf VOC response to D. citri was rootstock specific.</s><s>The numbers in the loading plots correspond to the compounds that are listed in Table 1.</s><s>PCA symbols: control trees are shown as closed symbols; infested trees are shown as open symbols; US-897 (orange circles); C-35 (green triangles); and SO (blue squares).</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="7,164.96,95.29,337.45,517.25" type="bitmap" /></figure>
