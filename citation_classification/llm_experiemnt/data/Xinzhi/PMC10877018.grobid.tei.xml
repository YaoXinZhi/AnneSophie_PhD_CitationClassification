<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Introduction: Asian citrus psyllid (ACP, Diaphorina citri) is an important transmission vector of "Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus" (CLas), the causal agent of Huanglongbing (HLB), the most destructive citrus disease in the world.</s><s>As there are currently no HLB-resistant rootstocks or varieties, the control of ACP is an important way to prevent HLB.</s><s>Some viruses of insect vectors can be used as genetically engineered materials to control insect vectors.</s></p><p><s>Methods: To gain knowledge on viruses in ACP in China, the prevalence of five RNA and DNA viruses was successfully determined by optimizing reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in individual adult ACPs.</s><s>The five ACPassociated viruses were identified as follows: diaphorina citri bunyavirus 2, which was newly identified by high-throughput sequencing in our lab, diaphorina citri reovirus (DcRV), diaphorina citri picorna-like virus (DcPLV), diaphorina citri bunyavirus (DcBV), and diaphorina citri densovirus-like virus (DcDV).</s></p><p><s>Results: DcPLV was the most prevalent and widespread ACP-associated virus, followed by DcBV, and it was detected in more than 50% of all samples tested.</s><s>DcPLV was also demonstrated to propagate vertically and found more in salivary glands among different tissues.</s><s>Approximately 60% of all adult insect samples were co-infected with more than one insect pathogen, including the five ACPassociated viruses and CLas.</s></p><p><s>Discussion: This is the first time these viruses, including the newly identified ACPassociated virus, have been detected in individual adult ACPs from natural populations in China's five major citrus-producing provinces.</s><s>These results provide valuable information about the prevalence of ACP-associated viruses in China, some of which have the potential to be used as biocontrol agents.</s><s>In addition, analysis of the change in prevalence of pathogens in a single insect vector is the basis for understanding the interactions between CLas, ACP, and insect viruses.</s></p></div>
