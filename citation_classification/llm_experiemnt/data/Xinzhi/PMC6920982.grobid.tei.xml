these behaviors cannot be easily observed and quantified, since the insects insert their piercing-sucking mouthparts into opaque plant tissues such that the subsequent probing activities are invisible to observers.</s><s>The most precise method of quantifying the probing behavior of hemipteran pests and vectors is electropenetrography (EPG).</s><s>EPG requires the attachment of conductive gold wire to the pronotum of the insect and the application of a small electrical signal to the host plant to complete an electrical circuit and generate a waveform (voltage by time) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>Probing waveforms are produced any time the insect inserts the stylets into plant tissues.</s><s>Waveforms are consistent and reproducible such that salivation, stylet

investigation, the specific mechanisms of Citrus host plant resistance to D. ctiri probing eludes researchers, and no comprehensive method has been employed to screen host plants for resistance to vector probing and pathogen transmission.</s><s>Many investigations into the probing behavior of a pest on variable hosts can discover probing differences.</s><s>However, placing those behavioral differences into context is crucial to understanding the underlying mechanisms of host plant resistance.</s><s>What are the specific characteristics of each host influencing vector probing behavior?</s><s>Does the host employ physical or chemical feeding deterrents, are there physical impediments to probing or accessing the phloem, does the phloem contain chemical defenses, and can the vector insect successfully oviposit and develop on the host?</s><s>To gain a comprehensive view of the total vector-host plant interactions, researchers must combine data obtained from other powerful techniques together with the observed probing differences.</s><s>The most comprehensive EPG studies combine an investigation of probing behavior with other powerful techniques, such as GC-MS <ref

previously untested potentially resistant mandarin selections with pummelo as a susceptible outgroup, we combined a robust investigation of probing behavior, a survey of oviposition and survival, and the determination of leaf metabolites for each host.</s><s>We expected that the life history data and leaf metabolites would mirror the EPG probing profiles and explain many aspects of D. citri probing behaviors on variably resistant Citrus hosts.</s><s>In order to achieve a baseline probing profile for each host, we chose to record pathogen-free psyllids.</s><s>Despite this, much of the analysis was completed with the transmission mechanism of the phloem-infecting Ca.</s><s>Liberibacter pathogen in mind.</s><s>As such, we focused our analysis on how successfully D. citri interacted with the phloem.</s><s>We calculated variables focused on determining the exact moment the psyllid reaches the phloem, how many different times the phloem was accessed, durations spent in phloem tissues, and how much of the time spent in phloem included ingestion behaviors.</s><s>This study demonstrates the capacity of the EPG technique to elucidate the details of probing differences of even closely related host plants.</s><s>The mandarin selections tested here were closely related, all sharing a single pollen donor parent, and yet the range of probing responses discovered was striking.</s><s>EPG is a powerful screening tool for determining probing responses of vectors of plant pathogens to resistant species and selections.</s></p></div>

significant treatment effect (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>), and representative waveforms from this study can be found in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</s><s>These variables largely focused on the sequence and timing of when psyllids reach the phloem and xylem and how long they spent performing phloem and xylem behaviors.</s><s>The timing and sequence of waveforms performed, and the location of the stylets during the performance of each waveform can provide insights as to the type of resistance factors affecting the probing behaviors on a tested host.</s><s>We found resistance factors impacting D. citri probing behavior at all levels of probing, within the cuticle and epidermis, parenchyma tissues en route to the phloem, at the edge of the phloem, and within the phloem sap.</s><s>The most resistant mandarin selections, 31 and 2, had resistance factors operating at all of these levels of probing, while D. citri probed more successfully on mandarin 19 and pummelo.</s><s>Behavioral profiles were developed to describe the cohort of probing behaviors exhibited by D. citri on each host.</s><s>The behavioral profile of D. citri on mandarin 31 indicated resistance factors at every level during the probing process: During the initiation of probing, while stylets pass through parenchyma tissues, phloem access, and maintenance of phloem ingestion.</s><s>Psyllids took longer to make the initial probe (TmFrstPrbFrmStrt-0.1 h) during the recording period and spent the most time not probing (TtlDurNP-7.9</s><s>h) on mandarin 31.</s><s>These variables indicate resistance factors affecting the beginning of the probe, either in the cuticle or epidermis, that prevent the psyllid from initiating a probe.</s><s>Psyllids probing mandarin 31 also exhibited a reduction of non-probing occurring before the first performance of waveform E1 (DurNnprbBfrFrstE1-3.8 h) among tested hosts.</s></p><p><s>Psyllids probing mandarin 31 also struggled during their initial contact with phloem tissues.</s><s>During waveform D, psyllids taste and salivate into a phloem sieve element, and make important decisions about the acceptability of the cell.</s><s>Longer waveform D events and longer periods overall spent performing waveform D represent the difficulty in finding an acceptable phloem sieve element from which to begin phloem ingestion.</s><s>The behavioral profile of psyllids probing mandarin 31 includes the highest values for four of the six statistically significant waveform D associated variables, including: NumLngD, maxD, meanD, and PrcntPrbD.</s><s>The number of long D waveform events lasting 100 s or more occurred 2.4 times per insect on mandarin 31, but only 0.2 and 0.3 times per insect on pummelo and mandarin 26, respectively.</s><s>Psyllids probing mandarin 31 also performed the longest duration of a single D waveform event (maxD-142 s), the longest mean duration of waveform D (meanD-90 s), and spent the largest percent of total probing time performing waveform D (PrcntPrbD-10.3%).</s><s>Psyllids also struggled to maintain phloem ingestion, while probing mandarin 31.</s><s>The longest phloem ingestion event (maxE2) on mandarin 31 was 2.3 h long, the shortest of all on tested host plants.</s><s>Psyllids spent the shortest time overall performing phloem ingestion (TtlDurE2-4.7 h) on Mandarin 31.</s><s>Diaphorina citri struggled both to access phloem tissues and maintain phloem ingestion, while probing mandarin 31.</s></p><p><s>The behavioral profile of D. citri probing mandarin 2 indicates resistance factors within the parenchyma, and factors influencing both phloem access and the psyllid's ability to maintain phloem ingestion.</s><s>Unlike when psyllids probed mandarin 31 the initiation of probing was delayed, psyllids probed mandarin 2 more quickly.</s><s>In fact, psyllids probing mandarin 2 had the shortest non-probing duration (TtlDurNP-4.7 h) of all tested hosts.</s><s>However, once probing commenced on mandarin 2, psyllids spent long durations passing through the parenchyma to reach the phloem.</s><s>While probing mandarin 2, psyllids performed the longest duration of waveform C (TtlDurC-11 h), representing time spent with stylets in parenchyma tissues, and the longest duration before the first waveform D was performed during the recording (TtlNnprbBfrFrstD-2.9 h).</s><s>Together, these variables represent an increased duration of time spent probing parenchyma tissues, resulting in a delayed and reduced duration of time spent probing phloem tissues.</s></p><p><s>The behavioral profile of D. citri probing mandarin 2 indicates substantial difficulty in accessing the phloem tissues.</s><s>The time that passes before phloem access is made up of the time spent not probing, the time spent probing parenchyma tissues (waveform C) and the time spent and the number of waveform events of waveform D, and at times the performance of xylem ingestion (waveform G), which psyllids will often do when they cannot access or maintain phloem ingestion.</s><s>In the case of psyllids probing mandarin 2, several variables are associated with difficulty accessing the phloem, including: An increased time to the first sustained E2 waveform (TmFrstSusE2-15.1 h), an increased time from the first probe to the first E waveform event (TmFrmFrstPrbFrstE-12.3</s><s>h), and increased time to the first E2 waveform from the start of the recording (TmFrstE2StrtEPG-13.8 h), and an increased time to the first sustained E2 waveform from the start of the first probe (TmFrstSusE2FrstPrb-15 h).</s><s>Psyllids probing mandarin 2 struggled to maintain phloem ingestion and especially struggled to maintain sustained phloem ingestion, defined as phloem ingestion events lasting longer than 600 s.</s><s>While probing mandarin 2, psyllids spent the smallest percentage of phloem ingestion performing sustained phloem ingestion (PrcntE2SusE2-44%) and performed the smallest number of long E2 waveform events (NumLngE2-1.3)</s><s>compared to other tested hosts.</s><s>Additionally, psyllids spent the largest duration ingesting from xylem (DurG-3 h), while probing mandarin 2, a behavioral switch performed when psyllids cannot successfully access or maintain phloem ingestion.</s></p><p><s>The behavioral profile of D. citri probing mandarin 26 indicated resistance factors to probing is minimal from the cuticle, epidermis, and edge of the phloem, but are clearer for behaviors performed in parenchyma tissues and within the phloem sieve elements.</s><s>Evidence of resistance factors in the parenchyma include an increased time to the first performance of waveform D within each probe (TmFrmFrstPrbFrstD-7.8 h), an increased duration of the total time not spent with stylets in phloem tissues (TtlDurNnPhlPhs-19.1 h), as well as the fact that psyllids spent 62% of probing time performing waveform C primarily within parenchyma tissues.</s><s>Once the phloem tissues were accessed, psyllids struggled to maintain phloem ingestion, with the smallest percentage of phloem ingestion of total probing duration (PrcntPrbE2-19.5%)</s><s>occurring as psyllids probed mandarin 26.</s></p><p><s>The behavioral profile of D. citri probing mandarin 19 was not strongly linked to any resistance-associated behaviors.</s><s>Rather, psyllids initiated probing quickly, spent an average time performing waveform C in parenchyma tissues, accessed the phloem relatively easily, spent the most time in phloem (TtlDurE2-10.4</s><s>h), and performed the largest percentage of time ingesting from phloem of the total probing duration (PrcntPrbE2-57%).</s><s>In fact, psyllids probing mandarin 19 spent nearly three times longer ingesting from phloem compared to psyllids probing the most resistant selection, mandarin 31, with only 22.5% probing time spent in phloem.</s></p><p><s>The behavioral profile of D. citri probing pummelo was not strongly linked to any resistance-associated behaviors.</s><s>Rather, psyllids readily probed, reached the phloem quickly, and spent long durations performing sustained phloem ingestion.</s><s>Psyllids probing pummelo spent the least amount of time passing through parenchyma tissues (TtlDurC-7.9 h), and once the phloem was contacted, psyllids performed the shortest waveform D (meanD-43 s), allowing them to begin phloem salivation and ingestion quickly (TmFrstE2StrtEPG-7.4</s><s>h).</s><s>Once phloem ingestion began, psyllids spent relatively more time ingesting phloem (PrcntPrbE2-37%) and the most time performing sustained phloem ingestion (PrcntE2SusE2-72%) of time spent ingesting phloem sap overall.</s></p></div>

highest concentrations in the most resistant mandarin selections, mandarin 31 and 2. In fact, Mandarin 2 was found to contain the highest concentration of quinic acid, with mandarin 19 and 31, containing only slightly lower concentrations, within 0.1 µg/g.</s></p><p><s>Pummelo contained more than twice concentration of the amino acid serine compared to other selections, with the next highest concentration found in mandarin 26.</s><s>Pummelo also exhibited three times the concentration of the sugar xylose compared to other selections, with the next highest concentration found in mandarin 26.</s><s>Pummelo had higher than average concentrations of other sugars and sugar acids compared to the mandarin selections, indicating that pummelo is more nutritious to psyllids compared to the tested mandarin selections.</s><s>While pummelo is relatively defended against psyllids and other pests, having generally higher levels of succinic acid and quinic acids found in leaf tissues, D. citri probed pummelo most successfully compared to the tested mandarin selections, possibly indicating that nutrition is more important to D. citri than defense on these tested host plants.</s></p><p><s>Another interpretation of our results is that pummelo, the most susceptible plant tested, may not have a complex arsenal of constitutive defensive metabolites, but rather upregulated the production of succinic acid and quinic acid in response to D. citri probing, while the other more resistant mandarin selections, 31 and 2, had generally high constitutive levels of these compounds.</s><s>Defensive plant metabolites can be induced in response to pest attack <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>, pathogen attack <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, and as a wound response <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>.</s><s>It is also possible that the behavioral profiles of D. citri found on mandarin selections and pummelo is more closely correlated with psyllid nutrition rather than defensive metabolites.</s><s>Albrecht, et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref> found sugar concentrations to be a limiting factor of HLB disease development in Cleopatra mandarin and found defensive compounds were not tightly associated with resistance to HLB.</s><s>Lower concentrations of sugars and sugar acids in mandarin 31 and mandarin 2 might be more important variables linking D. citri probing behavior and host preference rather than high levels of defensive metabolites.</s></p><p><s>Though not statistically significant in our study, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels were highest in the mandarin selections most resistant to D. citri probing and lowest in the mandarin selection and pummelo most susceptible to D. citri probing.</s><s>There is a growing body of evidence that increased GABA levels act as an antibiosis mechanism of plant defense, negatively impacting insects through reduced feeding and survival <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>.</s><s>Insects performed less well on diets enhanced with GABA <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63]</ref>.</s><s>Transgenic tobacco plants (Nicotiana tabacum) that over-produce GABA, deter feeding by tobacco budworms, Heliothis virescens <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>.</s><s>The mechanism of GABA impact on insect neurochemistry is thought to occur through inhibition of GABA-controlled chloride channels in the peripheral nervous system.</s></p></div>
