recognized by RNase III (an endoribonuclease) that clips dsRNA molecules into small (20-25 base) fragments, or small interfering RNAs (siRNAs).</s><s>A single siRNA strand is then incorporated into the RNA Induced Silencing Complex (RISC), which uses the siRNA to bind (by hybridization) mRNAs in the cytosol by sequence complementary recognition.</s><s>The catalytic subunit of the RISC (a member of the Argonaut protein family with endonuclease activity) then cleaves the mRNA rendering it non-functional <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bernstein et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Lipardi et al., 2001)</ref>.</s><s>This effect can be redirected against the host cell by the exogenous introduction of dsRNAs having sequence identity for host genes, resulting in the reduction of host cell mRNA abundance and subsequent loss of function <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Fire et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Gregory et al., 2005)</ref>.</s><s>RNAi

Inc.</s><s>Sequences that induce an RNAi-based toxicity in D. citri were identified by "solvers" (scientists and experts) as potential D. citri gene targets for silencing by oral uptake of synthetic dsRNAs using artificial diet <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Hall et al., 2010)</ref>.</s><s>Forty-three genes were ultimately targeted and screened for susceptibility to gene silencing causing D. citri mortality.</s><s>Of these, the Rieske gene, that expresses an iron sulfur cluster, a soluble domain of Complex III of the electron transport chain (ETC), is known to cause mortality in other insects.</s><s>Therefore, proteins involved in ETC aerobic metabolism could be used as potential targets for pest control using RNA interference <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Wuriyanghan et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>In addition, RNAi targeting was observed on G-protein coupled receptors with transmembrane sequences like chemokine receptors inhibiting HIV-1 replication <ref type="bibr"

perhaps due to a lower turnover of these proteins as compared with the ISP subunit (Rieske) of cytochrome bc1 complex located in the inter-membrane space.</s><s>It is interesting to note that the turnover of mitochondrial proteins is generally low (6-12%) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Augustin et al., 2007)</ref>.</s><s>Mitochondrial proteases that are involved in mitochondrial proteins turnover are found in both the mitochondrial inter-membrane space, inner membrane and matrix, however, their activities and roles may be differently regulated <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Koppen and Langer, 2007)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, subunits that exhibit a higher turnover are better targets for RNA silencing.</s><s>Indeed, when dsRNA against Cytb, a subunit of cytochrome bc1 complex found in the inner mitochondrial membrane <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Herrman and Neupert, 2003)</ref> was fed to D. citri no effect was observed (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>) indicating that perhaps the location of the ETC subunits in the mitochondria may determine their turnover and vulnerability to RNA silencing.</s><s>Our feeding experiments did not test mixtures of dsRNAs targeting several components of the ETC.</s><s>In future experiments, however, down regulating multiple components of this pathway may prove to be more effective than targeting only one transcript (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>RNA interference studies continue to highlight the complexity of insect orally induced mortality using exogenous dsRNAs.</s><s>Thus, it is important to use gene internal sequences that correlate well with published and experimentally tested RNAi effects recognizing that secondary structure and base-pair length of the selected dsRNA are important in optimizing RNAi silencing effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Elbashir et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Lee et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Yoshinari et al., 2004)</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, it is possible that designing alternate dsRNA constructs against domain genes that reside in the inter membrane space of the mitochondria like Rieske, and combinations of dsRNA targeting different genes may cause higher mortalities by oral uptake as was shown in lung cancer by reversing drug resistance <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Ganesh et al., 2013)</ref> or in corneal fibroblast in which a combination of triple dsRNAs were used to target three different scarring genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Sriram et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>In Tribolium castaneum 5,000 randomly screened genes were tested as RNAi potential targets and 11 genes were identified as highly efficient RNAi targets showing effective inhibition however no qPCR data or Northern blot analyses to correlate the effect of these genes with mortalities is provided.</s><s>The authors similarly to our approach use GO term combinations to show the efficiency of the RNAi target genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Ulrich et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>These genes, however, were not tested by us and in future studies we may test them even though there are not known reports that they ever were effective on the Asian Citrus psyllids.</s></p><p><s>Expressing dsRNAs in citrus using engineered CTV-RIE and testing feeding D. citri on single leaves caused 2-fold higher mortality than feeding on artificial diet containing dsRNA (65.7% and 35.4%, respectively) (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A-C</ref>), and in several cases 100% mortality was observed.</s><s>These results indicate that artificial diet is inferior to feeding on engineered leaves that contain all the nutrients that are not found in artificial diet specifically when controls give very high mortality and thus these artificial diets cannot be used in long duration studies.</s><s>We used artificial diets to rapidly screen several hundred dsRNA candidates that were generated by crowd sourcing to select few dsRNA candidates that were then cloned and express by engineered CTV in citrus and allowed us to test D. citri by feeding on engineered CTV in citrus leaves.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Gong et al. (2011)</ref> reported that coating cabbage leaves with three siRNAs-RIE of Plutella xylostella caused significant mortalities lowering the Rieske transcript.</s><s>Similarly, citrus leaves that were infected with CTV-RIE and fed to D. citri showed significant reduction in Rieske transcript abundance in D. citri gut tissue as compared with the whole insect tissue devoid of its gut.</s><s>These observations support our hypothesis that oral delivery of dsRNA produces a predominantly localized response in the gut tissue and that adult D. citri do not amplify or transport dsRNA templates systemically as nematodes and Tribolium <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Fire et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Miller et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>The most economical way to deliver dsRNA to insects is to express dsRNA as a long hairpin (LHP) RNA in plants or cells that are eaten by insects.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Baum et al. (2007)</ref> expressed LHP RNA of vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) in corn as an alternative to Bacillus thuringiensis corn expressing the Bt bacterial toxin and showed significant reduction in corn root damage after exposing the transgenic plants to western corn rootworm (D. virgifera virgifera).</s><s>Following this report, two model plants Nicotiana tabacum and Arabidopsis thaliana were genetically engineered to express LHP RNA of cytochrome P450 of the cotton bollworm (H.</s><s>armigera).</s><s>Feeding this insect on leaves of the genetically transformed plants reduced cytochrome P450 transcript and larval growth was affected.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Van Ekert et al. (2014)</ref> transformed yeast cells (Pichia pastoris) and expressed LHP-RNA against Aedes aegypti juvenile hormone acid methyltransferase transcript (jmtA).</s><s>Mosquito larvae that were fed on these recombinant cells stopped larval development and the few adults that emerged died within 3 days, indicating that this technique is useful against agricultural pests, as well as disease transmitting insects.</s><s>It is possible that the potency of our dsRNA-RIE could be attributed to resistance to nuclease digestion.</s><s>In Tribolium castaneum <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Cao et al. (2018)</ref> reported that nucleases play a role in the stability and effectiveness of RNAi.</s><s>In psyllids it was shown that dsRNA was not degraded by insect saliva that was secreted into an artificial medium during feeding.</s><s>The tested dsRNA was not degraded from saliva that is excreted into the medium after feeding for 120 h <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Galdeano et al., 2017)</ref>.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Killiny and Kishk (2017)</ref> reported that the target of the ingested dsRNA in D. citri is found in the gut by mixing dsRNA with a dye and microscopically showed that the dsRNA-dye was found in the psyllid gut.</s><s>However, the presence of nucleases in D. citri gut was not tested and it is unknown what role nucleases play in digesting dsRNA in D. citri gut.</s><s>Thus, it is important in future studies to find whether nucleases degrade dsRNA-RIE in D. citri gut.</s><s>It is also possible that some of the primers that we have used were not optimal or were amplifying shorter regions that are optimal and may have to be retested in future studies.</s></p><p><s>An RNA Seq analysis of the genes affected by the dsRNA targeting the aerobic metabolic Rieske gene was performed to find out the cause of death of D. citri after Rieske silencing.</s><s>Transcriptome analysis showed multiple potential pathways that are vulnerable after transcriptional modification in D. citri that could be used in future RNAi strategies (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</s><s>The "downstream effects" that are not the result of Rieske or ETC malfunction include nitrogen, organonitrogen, nucleoside and nucleotide metabolic processes.</s><s>Conversely, nucleic acid, nucleotide, and nucleoside binding, catalysis, phosphorylation, hydrolysis, and metabolism were identified as being indirectly affected as a consequence of the metabolic pathways of aerobic metabolism (ETC) being stressed, or "upstream effects" (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</s><s>These pathways may also be sensitive to a decrease in the products of the ETC metabolism such as the oxidative state of the cell, cellular energy production, and phosphorylation.</s><s>These processes are associated with cell-cycle regulation, cell-death, cell-division, cell-proliferation, DNA/RNA repair, nutrient metabolism (including carbon-nitrogen, glycosyl, peptide hydrolysis, lipid and carbohydrate biosynthesis.</s></p><p><s>Recent RNAi and enzymatic activity studies in Drosophila implicate an energy (or ATP) deficiency role in protein folding within the endoplasmic reticulum leading to cellcycle arrest/delay at the G1 and G2/M checkpoints <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Thomas et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>The role of cell-cycle regulation in celldivision/proliferation is well established <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Zhou et al., 2002)</ref>, recent studies showed that when the ER (Endoplasmic reticulum) is under stress impairment in the expression of mediators will cause cell-death, energy and nutritional deficiencies <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Miller et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>The role of p53, an activator of DNA repair enzymes and mediator of cell-death <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Cho et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Xie et al., 2001)</ref>, and a CHK1, a serine/threonine-protein kinase involved in cell-cycle checkpoint regulation by phosphorylation <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Liu et al., 2000)</ref> in cell-death is correlated with ER stress.</s><s>Thus, our virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) is an important intermediate step in the engineering of transgenic D. citri resistant cultivars.</s><s>Using RNA Seq analyses and next generation sequencing we identified genes (other than those targeted) that were transcriptional modified <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Ratcliff et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Ma et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Morilla et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Folimonov et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Hunter et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Velásquez et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Gan et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Jiang et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Liu et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>These genes were functionally annotated, and the majority (either upstream or downstream) were found to be functionally associated with the primary function performed by the Rieske (ETC) gene targeted by VIGS <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Dhur et al., 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Baum et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Wuriyanghan et al., 2011</ref>;
