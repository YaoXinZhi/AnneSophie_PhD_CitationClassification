<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p><s>The Asian citrus psyllid Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Psyllidae) is one of the most destructive pests of citrus, due primarily to the fact of its role as the vector of Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CLas) which, worldwide, causes the highly destructive citrus disease huanglongbing (HLB) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>.</s><s>Huanglongbing is one of the most lethal diseases against citrus and, currently, there is no cure.</s><s>Diaphorina citri was first described in Taiwan Province in 1907 <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, and the infectious nature of HLB was described in Southern China in 1956 <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>Large populations of D. citri in HLB-endemic areas often result in high incidences and spread of HLB.</s><s>Controlling D. citri to reduce its availability as a vector of CLas has been a pivotal global strategy to restrict the spread of HLB.</s><s>The recent rapid spread of HLB in the Americas has motivated extensive research aimed at improving the understanding of D. citri biology, ecology, and management tactics <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Several factors contribute to the status of D. citri as a serious pest species, including adaptation to a wide range of host plants <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, a short life cycle and high fecundity <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, adaptation to growth at a wide range of temperatures <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>, high dispersal ability <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, and high capacity to evolve resistance to different types of insecticides <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>Intense use of insecticides has led to the development of high levels of insecticide resistance in D. citri populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, the development of novel highly specific and environmentally friendly methods must be considered for controlling this pest.</s></p><p><s>RNA interference (RNAi) technology is a powerful tool for functional studies that can be used to selectively suppress the expression of target genes both in vitro and in vivo <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>RNA interference has been widely explored as an alternative to conventional management methods for controlling insect pests <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>For example, bacterially expressed double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) from the lesswright (lwr) gene of Henosepilachna vigintioctopunctata was applied to eggplant leaves and caused 88% mortality for the 1st larvae of H. vigintioctopunctata, 66% mortality for the 3rd instar larvae, and 36% mortality to the adults after 10 d, 10 d, and 14 d of application, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The genome of D. citri has been sequenced in recent years (GCA_000475195.1).</s><s>In addition, transcriptomes of the terminal abdomen and antennae of adult male and female D. citri (SRX1330478-SRX1330481), those of CLas-free and CLas-infected D. citri nymphs and adults (SRX525230, SRX525218, SRX525209, SRX525152), and those encompassing the three main life stages of D. citri (egg, nymph/larva, and adult) have also been sequenced <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>Diaphorina citri undergoes gradual metamorphosis and, as noted, has three differentiated life stages.</s><s>The metamorphic changes are accompanied by changes in gene expression.</s><s>Molecular characterization of D. citri at its various stages of morphogenesis would likely provide important inroads into the identification of novel target sites for pest control.</s><s>Furthermore, comparison of the developmental transcriptomes of D. citri from the eggs, each of the instars, and adult male and female insects would provide insights into the function of numerous genes and the regulation of different signaling pathways involved during the different developmental stages.</s></p><p><s>Trehalose is a natural alpha-linked disaccharide formed by an α,α-1,1-glucoside bond between two α-glucose units.</s><s>Trehalose can be used as an energy source by bacteria, fungi, insects, invertebrates, plants, and a large number of other organisms and plays an important role in stress tolerance <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>Trehalose is hydrolyzed by the enzyme trehalase into glucose to rapidly provide energy when needed.</s><s>Trehalase is also the first enzyme in the chitin biosynthesis pathway and significantly influences chitin metabolism by regulating the pathway.</s><s>Therefore, trehalase has great potential as a target gene for controlling insects using RNAi technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In the current study, we attempted to obtain expression data throughout all developmental stages of D. citri by performing comprehensive RNA sequencing.</s><s>In addition, two trehalase genes were characterized and their functions investigated using RNAi technology.</s><s>The assembled and annotated transcriptome sequences and gene expression profiles should provide useful information for the identification of genes involved in D. citri development and will facilitate functional genomics studies on this destructive insect species.</s></p></div>
