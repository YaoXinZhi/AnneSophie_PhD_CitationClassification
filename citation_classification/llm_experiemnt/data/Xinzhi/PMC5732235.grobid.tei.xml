<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RSMV Acquisition Ability of R. dorsalis</head><p><s>In the three experiments in which RSMV was detected in R. dorsalis adults collected from the second-generation populations raised on RSMV-infected rice plants, 66.7% (20/30), 80.0% (24/30), and 69.0%</s><s>(20/29) of R. dorsalis adults were RSMV positive.</s><s>The values were not significantly different.</s><s>This indicated that R. dorsalis has a high frequency of virus acquisition from RSMV-infected rice plants after long-term feeding, and its viral mean acquisition rate can reach 71.9% (64/89).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RSMV Acquisition Efficiency of R. dorsalis</head><p><s>The R. dorsalis nymphs and adults could become RSMV positive after feeding on the virus-infected rice plants for 3 min, with acquisition rates of 24.4 and 19.2%, respectively (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>The acquisition rate gradually increased as the feeding time increased, and the rates in nymphs and adults increased to 66.7 and 58.9%, respectively, after 3 h of feeding (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Compared with adults, nymphs had higher acquisition rates (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RSMV Inoculation Efficiency of R. dorsalis</head><p><s>Neither the nymphs nor adults of virus-positive R. dorsalis could transmit RSMV to the tested plants within 10 min, but they successfully established infections in 15.0% and 5.0% of the tested plants, respectively, after 30 min of feeding (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s><s>The RSMV inoculation rate increased at 1 h of feeding, and the nymphs and adults could establish infections in 57.1 and 50.0% of the tested plants, respectively (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Latent Period of RSMV in R. dorsalis</head><p><s>Using RT-PCR, 21 of the 32 tested leafhoppers were confirmed RSMV positive.</s><s>The latent period of the virus in these 21 individuals was examined using viral transmission assays (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>).</s><s>The minimum latent period of RSMV in R. dorsalis was 6 d (in insect no.</s><s>4) and the maximum period was 18 d (in insect no.</s><s>21).</s><s>The latent period averaged 13 d (ranging from 6 to 18 d) under our experimental conditions.</s><s>Some of the tested individuals (nos.</s><s>6, 7, 9, 13, 16, 19, and 21) could continuously transmit RSMV throughout their lives, but most of them intermittently transmitted the virus at intervals of 2-6 d.</s><s>Three tested individuals (nos.</s><s>1-3) could not transmit the virus at any time during their lifespan.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>R. dorsalis Could Not Transmit RSMV through Eggs</head><p><s>Out of 70 pairs of leafhoppers that fed on RSMV-infected rice plant for the whole nymphal stage, 39 females were RSMV positive and 31 of their partner males were also virus positive.</s><s>RSMV could not be detected in any of the 376 R. dorsalis individuals propagated from these 39 RSMV positive females, which indicated that RSMV was most likely not transmitted through the eggs of R. dorsalis.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Propagation of RSMV in R. dorsalis</head><p><s>The negative staining of midgut tissues from the RSMV-positive R. dorsalis revealed many bacilliform virions, having an average length of 325 nm and average width of 50 nm (n = 50), that were absent in the negative leafhoppers (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>).</s><s>This was consistent with our previous observations of RSMV virions in rice plants <ref type="bibr">(Yang et al., 2017a)</ref>.</s><s>The bacilliform virions were mostly assembled into blocks and arranged in order.</s><s>In particular, the virion blocks were adjacent to the electron-dense viral replication complex in the cytoplasm (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>), which strongly suggests that the virions were formed by replication in R. dorsalis.</s></p><p><s>To further verify the propagation of RSMV in R. dorsalis, the viral titers in leafhoppers at different time points after acquisition were determined using RT-qPCR.</s><s>The RSMV's mean titer in R. dorsalis showed an increasing trend after the leafhoppers left the virus-infected rice plants (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>).</s><s>The viral mean titer at  d 5 (1.498) and 10 (1.756) were significantly higher compared with the mean titer at d 1 (0.517) after virus acquisition, but the mean titers at d 5 and 10 were not significantly different (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>).</s><s>These results indicated that RSMV propagated in the vector R. dorsalis.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>Currently, the members of genus Cytorhabdovirus are mainly transmitted by planthoppers or aphids, except some viruses transmitted by unknown vectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Jackson et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ammar et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>Interestingly, based on genome sequences, aphidvectored viruses form a group, planthopper-vectored viruses form another group, and RSMV belongs to yet another subgroup <ref type="bibr">(Yang et al., 2017a)</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, nucleorhabdoviruses were similar to cytorhabdoviruses, which were also subgrouped based on their insect vectors <ref type="bibr">(Yang et al., 2017a)</ref>.</s><s>In this study, RSMV is efficient transmitted by the leafhopper R. dorsalis, suggesting that this may be a useful feature for plant rhabdovirus classification.</s><s>Plant rhabdoviruses have a high degree of vector specificity and most are transmitted naturally by one or only a few closely related insect species <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Jackson et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ammar et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>For example, Barley yellow striate mosaic virus (BYSMV) is mostly transmitted, with a high efficiency, by the small brown planthopper (Laodelphax striatellus), while another planthopper, Javesella pellucida, has a much lower transmission efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Conti, 1980)</ref>.</s><s>Wheat American striate mosaic virus (WASMV) is transmitted by the leafhopper Endria inimical, while Elymana virescens, which is a close relative, only acts as a secondary transmission vector <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Slykhuis, 1963;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Sinsk, 1970)</ref>.</s><s>The two species of aphids Hyperomyzus lactucae and Hyperomyzus carduellinus can transmit Lettuce necrotic yellows virus (LNYV), but the former is the primary transmission vector <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Randles, 1983)</ref>.</s><s>R. dorsalis is the efficient transmission vector of RSMV, and the second generation of R. dorsalis adults propagated on RSMV-infected rice plants have a very high RSMV-positive rate of over 70%.</s><s>According to our field survey, N. cincticeps, another species of leafhopper, can also carry RSMV.</s><s>However, the RSMV positive rate was significantly lower than that of R. dorsalis, and the virus transmission assay using N. cincticeps was also unsuccessful (unpublished data).</s><s>Whether N. cincticeps is an additional vector of RSMV needs further investigation.</s></p><p><s>There are four basic types of insect vector-plant virus transmission relationships, non-persistent, semi-persistent, persistent-circulative and persistent-propagative <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Whitfield et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Dietzgen et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>To date, all of the known insect-vectored cytorhabdoviruses are transmitted in a persistent-propagative manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Jackson et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Hogenhout et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ammar et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>RSMV is also transmitted by R. dorsalis in a persistent-propagative manner, and the relative viral titer increases in the insect vector (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>).</s><s>Some other rice viruses, like RGDV and Rice dwarf virus (RDV, Phytoreovirus), can be transovarially transmitted to offspring of the common vector R. dorsalis <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Zheng et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Chen et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>However, RSMV was likely not transmitted to the offspring of viruliferous R. dorsalis adults under our experimental conditions, which is consistent with other plant rhabdoviruses transmitted by leafhoppers or planthoppers <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Jackson et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ammar et al., 2009)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>For plant viruses transmitted in the persistent-propagative manner, the virion is usually acquired by their insect vectors from the infected plants within a few hours.</s><s>Both nymph and adult R. dorsalis acquired RSMV after 3 min of feeding on infected rice plants, and 3 h of feeding led to much higher acquisition rates (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>This R. dorsalis' acquisition access period for RSMV is much shorter than those of many other insect transmitted viruses, like Graminella sonora-transmitted sorghum stunt mosaic rhabdovirus (SSMV), L. striatellustransmitted BYSMV and R. dorsalis-transmitted RGDV <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Conti, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Morinaka et al., 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Creamer et al., 1997)</ref>, which need 6, 5 and 8 h, respectively.</s><s>The only know exception is WASMV.</s><s>Its vector, E. inimical, needs only 30 s to acquire the virus <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Slykhuis, 1963)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The latent period is required for the persistent-propagative transmission of viruses and is different lengths in different vector-virus combinations <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ammar et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>The latent period has important significance in viral epidemics and is also the basis of vector control-based disease prevention and control measures.</s><s>The latent period of RSMV in R. dorsalis was 8-16 d (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>), which is longer than the 4 d of WASMV in E. inimical <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Slykhuis, 1963)</ref> but similar to SSMV in G. sonora, Rice yellow stunt virus (RYSV) in N. cincticeps and SRBSDV in Sogatella furcifera <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Chiu et al., 1968;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Creamer et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Pu et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>In addition, RSMV had a 2-6 d intermittent period during its transmission (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>), but the mechanism behind the interval is unclear.</s><s>It may be caused by the insects' feeding behavior, which could involve frequent feeding on the plants during some stages but infrequent feeding during other stages.</s><s>Another plausible explanation would be the induction of an immune response, such as autophagy or apoptosis, that lowers the transmission efficiency by reducing the amount of virus in the insects.</s><s>Further studies on the mechanism of its intermittent transmission is required.</s><s>At least 30 min of feeding was needed for R. dorsalis to transmit RSMV to rice plants, and most needed 60 min of feeding (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s><s>Compared with other species of cytorhabdovirus, the inoculation access period of R. dorsalis transmitting RSMV was longer than that of E. inimical when transmitting WASMV, which takes only 15 min <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Slykhuis, 1963)</ref>, but was shorter than that of G. sonora transmitting SSMV, which takes 1 h <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Creamer et al., 1997)</ref>.</s><s>Also, compared with other rice viruses, the inoculation access period of R. dorsalis transmitting RSMV was longer than that of R. dorsalis when transmitting RDV, which takes only 10 min <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Shinkai, 1962)</ref>, but was similar to that of S. furcifera transmitting SRBSDV, which takes 30 min <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Pu et al., 2012)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Similar to most persistent-propagative transmission viruses <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Creamer et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Todd et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Pu et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Quito-Avila et al., 2012)</ref>, the leafhopper nymphs seem to have higher RSMV acquisition and inoculation rates than adults, and the extended acquisition and inoculation times lead to higher rates (Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s><s>If that is the case, then the spread of RSMVassociated diseases might occur mainly when nymphs are present in large numbers in the field, narrowing the window of time for viral spread to specific periods of the rice-growing season.</s><s>These features should be taken into consideration when formulating disease prevention strategies.</s></p><p><s>The vector-mediated transmission of plant viruses is fascinating biologically and evolutionarily.</s><s>However, there is little information available on genes or other factors involved in RSMV transmission.</s><s>The rhabdoviruses encode glycoprotein, which is exposed to the surfaces of the viral particles and is essential for virus attachment to cell receptors <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Jackson et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ammar et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Dietzgen et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>Further studies clarifying the functions of RSMV glycoprotein in interactions with vector genes during viral infection may help facilitate investigations into the molecular and cellular bases of RSMV acquisition and transmission processes.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc><div><p><s>: tested insect died; "Light gray": unable to transmit RSMV; "Dark gray": able to transmit
