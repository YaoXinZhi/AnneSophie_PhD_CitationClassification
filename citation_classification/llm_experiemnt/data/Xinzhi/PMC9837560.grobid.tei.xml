as the causal agent of fruitlet rot of pineapple (Ananas comosus) in the Philippines in 1928 <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>, P. ananatis has been known to cause severe losses of many other agronomic crop

infection include leaf blotch, spot, blight and dieback, stalk, fruit, and bulb rot depending on the specific host (reviewed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>).</s><s>On the other hand, some P. ananatis strains benefit plants by promoting their growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>P. ananatis strains have also been found in many insects, including mulberry pyralid (Glyphodes pyloalis), brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens), tobacco thrips (Frankliniella fusca), cotton fleahopper (Pseudatomoscelis seriatus), western corn rootworm (Diabrotica virgifera

only in the gut and was horizontally transmitted through thrip faeces <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, although it had no significant effects on fecundity or development <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>P. ananatis isolated from surface-sterilized tobacco thrips induces centre rot of onion <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, indicating thrips function as the vector of pathogenic P. ananatis in onion.</s><s>In addition, P. ananatis has developed an endophytic relationship with the cotton fleahopper that resulted in bacterial horizontal transmission when fleahoppers feed on cotton buds <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Multiple studies have reported an association between P. ananatis and Asian rice Oryza sativa <ref

domesticated about 9000 years ago and now is produced in about 120 countries worldwide.</s><s>In rice, P. ananatis strains can be beneficial by promoting rice growth under saline stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, by being strongly antagonistic to rice pathogens <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, and by facilitating rice straw degradation through its lignocellulose

small brown planthopper Laodelphax striatellus (Fallén) (Hemiptera: Delphacidae) is a destructive pest of rice.</s><s>L. striatellus causes direct physiological damage to crops via feeding on plant sap and laying eggs in rice tissues, and causes indirect economic loss by transmitting plant viruses (such as rice stripe virus) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>Pantoea was detected recently in many L. striatellus populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>However, the biology and functions of Pantoea in planthoppers were unknown.</s><s>Isolation of P. ananatis from both plants and animals indicates that it has adapted to a wide range of ecological environments.</s><s>Genome sequencing can be used to better understand the evolution and functions of P. ananatis in general.</s><s>In a pan-genomic analysis, De Maayer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> found many factors with putative roles in colonization and interaction of P. ananatis with plant, insect, and vertebrate hosts.</s><s>In particular, genomic analysis showed the secretion system genes and mobile genetic elements are different in closely related P. ananatis strains found on maize seeds but show different effects on host plants <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s>A pan-genomic analysis revealed a novel series of genetic regions that are correlated with pathogenicity of P. ananatis in onion <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s>However, the pathogenicity of P. ananatis to insect hosts and the genomic insights of insect-associated P. ananatis remain poorly understood.</s></p><p><s>Here, we studied the localization and pathogenicity of one P. ananatis strain (Lstr) that was recently isolated from L. striatellus and explored how Lstr is transmitted among insects.</s><s>In addition, we described the P. ananatis Lstr genome and compared it with other P. ananatis genomes.</s><s>Our genomic results show that P. ananatis can be grouped into two clades (one and two), which differ not only in phylogeny but also in many other genomic features.</s><s>The clade two members are closely associated with rice habitats.</s><s>We found the type VI secretion system (T6SS) that is important for pathogenicity of P. ananatis did not cluster according to phylogeny, suggesting that it might have evolved independently.</s></p></div>

lead to a loss of virulence <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[87]</ref>.</s><s>The IS elements are significantly different between clades one and two, which supports the idea that the two clades underwent different evolutionary paths.</s><s>Bacteriophages have been utilized to suppress bacterial palea browning of rice caused by P. ananatis <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[88]</ref>.</s><s>The P. ananatis Lstr prophage regions encode enzymes such as a DNA modification methylase, a muraminidase, and periplasmic serine proteases that may facilitate their invasion of bacteria.</s><s>P pili, which are required for the adhesion of pathogenic bacteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref>, were predicted to be synthesized by pp4 prophages (Table <ref type="table">S5</ref>).</s><s>Further studies are needed to determine what roles, if any, phage genes play in P. ananatis Lstr's pathogenicity to L. striatellus.</s><s>Some Pantoea species require T3SSs for pathogenicity when interacting with hosts <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">89]</ref>.</s><s>The PSI-2 T3SS was identified in P. ananatis strains 15 320 and DAR76143 <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>.</s><s>However, P. ananatis Lstr lacks genes homologous to T3SS but contains a complete T6SS.</s><s>T6SSs are present in several human and plant pathogens.</s><s>T6SSs have central roles in bacterial competition, pathogenesis, and host interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[90]</ref>.</s><s>P. ananatis harbours three T6SS loci, namely T6SS-1,-2, and -3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref>.</s><s>T6SS-1 and -3 are conserved among all P. ananatis strains <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref>.</s><s>The T6SS-1s of the PA13 and OC5a strains encode one more valine-glycine repeat (VgrG) effector protein than do the T6SS-1s of the TZ39, R100, and YJ76 strains, although all of these strains were isolated from rice.</s><s>T6SS-2 is present in the clade two members but the number of T6SS genes vary widely among P. ananatis strains.</s><s>Of the analysed clade one members, T6SS-2 is present in R100 but is missing in PA13, YJ76 and OC5a.</s><s>In a phylogenetic analysis of concatenated and TssC amino acid T6SS-2 and T6SS-1 genes were groups and the T6SS-2 of P. ananatis was close to the T6SS-2s of Erwinia spp.</s><s>and Serratia spp.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref>, indicating that T6SS-2 was present in an ancient ancestor of P. ananatis.</s><s>But why it is missing in many P. ananatis strains is unclear.</s><s>The T6SS-4s of P. ananatis harbour one or two duplicate copies of hcp and are first characterized in this study.</s><s>The hcp of T6SS-4 is located near an LLM class flavin-dependent oxidoreductase (COG2141) and a type I addiction module toxin of the SymE family (IAQ00_08520 in Lstr).</s><s>As the phylogeny of the Hcp proteins showed no convergence with Pantoea's phylogeny, we hypothesize that T6SS-4 has experienced multiple horizontal gene transfers.</s><s>Shyntum et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81]</ref> deleted the conserved T6SS-1 -3 gene clusters of Pantoea ananatis strain LMG 2665, respectively, and found that T6SS-1 plays an essential role in the pathogenicity of P. ananatis in onion plants, while deletion of T6SS-3 did not affect pathogenicity.</s><s>They also found that T6SS-1 but not T6SS-3 was required to inhibit competitor bacteria.</s><s>Additionally, that phenotypes of inhibiting competitors rely on TssA and Hcp, thus indicating that the T6SS-1 gene cluster encodes a functioning T6SS.</s><s>The genes of T6SS-3 can be found in T6SS-1, but many T6SS-1 genes (such as TssA and Hcp) are found only in T6SS-1 in LMG 2665.</s><s>It would be interesting to study whether T6SS-3 has functions that complement the functions of T6SS-1.</s><s>For example, do deletions of TssL and TssM in T6SS-1 change the pathogenicity of P. ananatis?</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, our results show that the P. ananatis Lstr behaves more like an insect gut symbiont but is also pathogenic to the host.</s><s>Our analysis of the P. ananatis Lstr genome and related genomes show that P. ananatis can be grouped into two clades (clades one and two) and that Lstr is in clade two.</s><s>In particular, the strains of clade two contain mainly bacteria isolated from rice or rice-associated samples.</s><s>The P. ananatis clade two members have significantly smaller genomes, and much fewer CDS but more pseudogenes, which suggests that they may be at the early stage of genome reduction <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref>.</s><s>Though the observed variations of T6SS were not distinguished between the two clades, further studies are needed to clarify whether the genome reduction of clade two P. ananatis strains is related to their close association with rice.</s><s>This study has clarified our understanding of the phylogenetic diversity of P. ananatis and provides further clues to the interactions between P. ananatis and rice that may lead to advances in rice protection and pest control.</s></p></div><figure
