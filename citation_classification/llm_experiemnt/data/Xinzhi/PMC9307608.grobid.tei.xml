affects stomatal development, which could lead to the alteration of the photosynthesis and plant development.</s><s>The action of WCM on resistant cultivar at 10 dpi was related to primary nitrogen metabolism with the inactivation of asparagine synthase genes that play an important role in nitrogen assimilation and distribution.</s><s>Nitrogen also plays a role in gene transcription by its involvement in RNA synthesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">55</ref> .</s><s>Collectively, our data suggest that the wheat transcriptome was impacted at 10 dpi in the susceptible

plant's ability to withstand or recover from insect/pest damage; however, the mechanisms underlying tolerance are poorly understood.</s><s>Recent studies have suggested that phytohormones play a major role in plant tolerance to insects <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[57]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[58]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[59]</ref> .</s><s>Previously, it was shown that metabolite levels were altered in wheat plants after shortterm (1 dpi) feeding by WCM <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">60</ref> .</s><s>While there were many differences in the responses between susceptible and resistant varieties, comparing DEGs between 1 dpi 38 and 10 dpi highlight some important mechanisms that can contribute to strengthening host plant resistance.</s><s>First, we observed that DEGs related to cell wall composition in the resistant variety were downregulated after 1 dpi <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">38</ref> , but they were upregulated after 10 dpi.</s><s>This indicate that resistant varieties are able to maintain a cell wall structure after prolonged WCM feeding.</s><s>Second, phytohormones play key roles in herbivore-induced defenses by activating key early signal transduction pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">61</ref> .</s><s>Our study identified a high number of DEGs involved in JA and ABA that can potentially modulate WCM-induced stress responses.</s><s>ABA is a phytohormone that regulates plant growth and development, and abiotic stress responses in plants <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">62</ref> .</s><s>ABA did not show significant induction at 1 dpi in either susceptible or resistant varieties.</s><s>In contrast, genes related to ABA were downregulated in susceptible varieties but upregulated in resistant varieties at 10 dpi.</s><s>We hypothesize that ABA will accumulate in the resistant wheat in response to damage of bulliform cells and photosynthesis and respiration stress from early symptoms of leaf curling.</s><s>JA also plays an important role in plant response to biotic stress.</s><s>DEGs related to JA pathway in susceptible varieties did not show significant response at 1 dpi yet they had a mix of both up-and downregulation of genes at 10 dpi.</s><s>However, genes related to JA pathway was upregulated in resistant varieties at both time points.</s><s>This suggests that JA plays a major role in wheat defense against WCM.</s><s>A previous study on hexaploid bread wheat (T.</s><s>aestivum var.</s><s>Zhongmai 175) infested with phytotoxic and non-phytotoxic aphids for two days exhibited the induction of plant defense responses in addition of JA, SA, and ET pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">63</ref> .</s><s>The expression of genes involved in phytohormone pathways in wheat is triggered by various insects/pests, and this process occurs after short and longer exposure to insect feeding.</s></p><p><s><ref type="url" target="www.nature.com/scientificreports/">www.nature.com/scientificreports/</ref></s><s>Chemical defenses play a decisive role in induced defense mechanisms against herbivore infestation <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">64</ref> We saw downregulation of genes related to secondary metabolites in the susceptible wheat variety, but a clear pattern for the resistant variety was not seen at 10 dpi.</s><s>Interestingly, DEGs related to secondary metabolites were upregulated at 1 dpi in the susceptible variety <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">38</ref> .</s><s>Five DEGs at 10 dpi had functions related to chymotrypsin inhibitor.</s><s>Trypsin and chymotrypsin are the major digestive serine proteases in lepidopteran insects.</s><s>In Arabidopsis, transgenic expression of barley protease inhibitor genes provided enhanced resistance to spider mites (T.</s><s>urticae) <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">65</ref> .</s><s>No investigations had been yet performed on the gut composition of WCM feeding on wheat.</s><s>However, our results suggest a role of chymotrypsin inhibitor in the wheat resistant cultivar at 10 dpi, possibly by countering WCM gut/saliva secretion.</s><s>Together, these results highlight the defense mechanisms used by the resistant wheat cultivar to limit WCM colonization.</s><s>Plant resistance against insect herbivory has focused on antibiosis, but evolution and adaptation of target pest population is inevitable.</s><s>Focusing on mechanisms that contribute to plant tolerance would be a more sustainable strategy.</s><s>We believe further studies can benefit from exploring the genetics of morphological features of tolerance (i.e., reduction of curling symptoms) and physiological mechanisms (e.g., ABA affecting photosynthetic rate, growth rate post infestation).</s></p><p><s>Because of its large genome size (17 Gb), wheat gene space organization was characterized with high gene density in the telomeric chromosome area <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">66,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">67</ref> .</s><s>The investigation of the location of the downregulated genes in the susceptible cultivar were only found enriched in the telomeric area of the large arm of the chromosome 3D.</s><s>Aegilops tauschii has been identified as a donor of the D-genome for the allohexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">68</ref> , and the D sub-genome contains fewer genes than the A and B sub-genomes.</s><s>Nevertheless, the D-genome has been identified as a reservoir for biotic and abiotic stress tolerance, and A. tauschii has been used to transfer useful genes to the allohexaploid wheat by direct hybridization or synthetic wheat for pest/pathogens resistance, abiotic stresses, and quality traits <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">69,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">70</ref> .</s><s>The geographical origin of A. tauschii in arid and semi-arid areas has been linked with the drought resistance role of the genes carried by the D-genome.</s><s>The morphological changes of the leaves in response to drought stress is similar to the response to WCM for wheat.</s><s>This could result from the inactivation of genes located in the sub-genome D. In this study, downregulated genes were related to stomatal complex development, tissue development, and phytochromobilin.</s><s>These functions in leaves are responses to drought for water retention (reduction in stomata density, low transpiration efficiency, and increased stomata size) <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">71</ref> .</s><s>Byrd resulted from the crossing of C0970547-7 and TAM112 <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">72</ref> .</s><s>The crossing history of TAM112 included an A. tauschii line, TA2460, known to carry the leaf rust resistance gene Lr41 and origin of the Cmc4 gene <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27</ref> .</s><s>This information attests of the importance of the D-sub-genome in resistance to WCM.</s><s>The investigation of the function of all the genes located in the 3DL telomeric region revealed functions related to plant defense mechanisms.</s><s>Interestingly, among the gene set located on 3DL and downregulated in the susceptible cultivar, 10 genes are upregulated in the resistant cultivar at 10 dpi.</s><s>These 10 genes are part of the 134 DEGs mentioned previously and have functions related to defense (TraesCS3D03G1115200: Phospholipase A1) or cell wall fortification (TraesCS3D03G1196300: Hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA transferase 2; TraesCS3D03G1035400: Hydroxyproline-rich glycoprotein).</s><s>Further investigation will be necessary to evaluate the transcriptomic activity of these genes during a time course in the wheat resistant cultivar.</s><s>Thus far, WCM resistant genes Cmc4 and Cmc2 have been identified in chromosome 6D of hexaploid wheat <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34</ref> .</s><s>In this study, we have shown that a portion of chromosome 3D was deactivated after prolonged WCM feeding in the susceptible cultivar.</s><s>These results will be an additional resource for plant breeders to develop wheat resilient cultivars and increase the genetic diversity.</s></p></div>
