(2) blue-sensitive opsin (BL-opsin) with the peak absorbance at 400-500 nm; and (3) ultraviolet-sensitive opsin (UV-opsin) with the peak absorbance at 300-400 nm <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>Drosophila has 7 opsins (Rh1-7), of which Rh1, Rh2, and Rh5 are sensitive to blue light (absorption maxima of 486, 418, and 442 nm), Rh3 and Rh4 are sensitive to UV light (331 and 355 nm), and Rh6 is sensitive to green light (515 nm) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>Rh7 functions as a light detector and is involved in the regulation of the circadian rhythm <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>It should be noted that different insect species vary in the number of opsins that they possess.</s><s>For example, BL-opsin gene loss occurs in some species, such as Tribolium castaneum (red flour beetle, Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae), aphids (Aphidoidea), and planthoppers (Fulgoroidea) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Opsins form covalent bonds with small molecular chromophores, thereby creating light-sensitive photopigments known as rhodopsins, which act as the primary activators in the phototransduction cascade <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>The phototransduction pathway in Drosophila is most intensively studied.</s><s>Light activates rhodopsin into metarhodopsin with chromophore conformational change, which initiates the G protein-mediated phototransduction cascade, leading to calcium and sodium ion exchange and the translation of light stimulus into an electrical signal <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s>A mutation in LW-opsin has been shown to alter gene expression in the phototransduction pathway in Plutella xylostella (diamondback moth, Lepidoptera: Plutellidae) <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s>Gene expression associated with the phototransduction pathway in the head of Mythimna separata (oriental armyworm, Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) was significantly altered following exposure to various light environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, it was hypothesized that genes within the phototransduction pathway may enhance the phototaxis of the Asian citrus psyllid, making it essential to understand this pathway in D. citri.</s></p><p><s>Four visual photo-sensing opsins were identified in ACP: Dc-UV (UV-opsin), clustering with Drosophila Rh3 and Rh4; Dc-BW (BL-opsin), clustering with Rh5; Dc-LW (LWopsin), clustering with Rh6; and Dc-UV-like, clustering with Rh7 <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>The inhibition of UV-opsin, BL-opsin, and LW-opsin resulted in a reduction in phototactic response rates to the corresponding light source in ACP <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>The expression of LW-opsin was observed to be the highest in ACP adults, in comparison to the other opsins <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, only the expression of LW-opsin was found to be significantly up-regulated in response to white light treatment in comparison to dark treatment in our previous study (data not supplied).</s><s>Accordingly, LW-opsin was selected as the target gene for further experimentation.</s><s>To investigate the phototransduction pathway in D. citri, we first employed the RNA interference (RNAi) technique to inhibit LW-opsin gene expression, followed by RNA-Seq analysis to investigate the complete set of genes involved in phototransduction.</s><s>Ultimately, inhibition of LW-opsin expression was observed to influence the mRNA expression levels of specific phototransduction genes, as determined by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR).</s><s>This study advances our understanding of the phototransduction pathway in D. citri and provides theoretical guidance for identifying elicitors that could enhance D. citri phototaxis in the future.</s></p></div>
