<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Increasing studies demonstrate that sphingolipids and their metabolizing enzymes may have a role in controlling viral infection in mammalian cells (Schneider-Schaulies and Schneider-Schaulies 2015).</s><s>However, it remains unclear whether this is also true with viral infection in insects.</s><s>In this study, we identified 12 genes that encode putative 12 distinct sphingolipid-metabolizing enzymes in L. striatellus and found that some of these genes and the contents of several sphingolipid species were regulated by RSV infection, suggesting that sphingolipids and their metabolizing enzymes may also play a role in viral infection of insects.</s></p><p><s>All protein sequences of 12 sphingolipid metabolizing enzymes (shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) display significant homology to those found in other insects.</s><s>Since sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Kihara et al. 2007)</ref> and their metabolizing enzymes are evolutionarily conserved <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Huitema et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Levy and Futerman 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Pitson 2011)</ref>, we suggest that these 12 genes are highly conserved among insects (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>According to the results of transcriptional profiling of six life stages, 12 genes were differentially expressed in two colonies of L. striatellus and had great variances between viruliferous and non-viruliferous L. striatellus (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>LsCK showed lower expression in nymphs of viruliferous L. striatellus than in nymphs of non-viruliferous L. striatellus (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>), which may lead to ceramide accumulation in nymphs of viruliferous L. striatellus.</s><s>We postulated that the increased ceramides may play roles in RSV infection or replication in L. striatellus since ceramide accumulation has been shown to facilitate Japanese encephalitis virus entry and infection in Huh cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bollinger et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Tani et al. 2010)</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, the transcripts of LsCGT1, LsNAGA1, LsSGPP, LsSMPD4, LsSMS, and LsSPT were elevated in most stages of viruliferous L. striatellus compared with the non-viruliferous L. striatellus, suggesting that RSV infection may induce the expression of these six genes.</s><s>It has been shown that suppressing SPT expression can inhibit HCV replication <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Katsume et al. 2013</ref>), so we predicted that the increase in the expression of LsSPT may have a role in facilitating L. striatellus infection by RSV.</s><s>As SMPD4 activation has been implicated in facilitating measles virus to infect cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Mueller et al. 2014)</ref>, it is possible that the increased expression of LsSMPD4 may also assist RSV to infect L. striatellus.</s><s>The role for the other four genes in RSV infection remains to be determined.</s><s>Nymphs of L. striatellus, especially the third and fourth instar nymphs were proposed to be a more efficient vector to RSV than adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Li et al. 2015)</ref>.</s><s>In this study, the transcriptional levels of RSV CP gene reached the peak at the third instar, so did the transcripts of four genes (LsCGT1, LsSMPD2, LsNAGA1, and LsSMS).</s><s>This correlation may indicate a potential role of these genes in RSV replication in the third nymph.</s><s>Viral infection and replication not only influence the transcript levels of sphingolipid enzymes but also the content of sphingolipid species.</s><s>For instance, in HCMV infected cells, viral infection results in alteration of the content of several sphingolipid species, including ceramide, dihydrosphingosine-1phosphate, and dihydrosphingosine <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Machesky et al. 2008)</ref>.</s><s>In line with these observations, we observed the higher levels of ceramides in RSV-infected nymphs of L. striatellus, suggesting that RSV infection or replication may induce the accumulation of ceramides.</s><s>It was suggested that ceramide-enrichment domains may create an environment enhancing virus infection (Schneider-Schaulies and Schneider-Schaulies 2015), we predicted that the increased ceramides may facilitate RSV to infect L. striatellus.</s><s>In contrast to ceramides, the content of dihydrosphingosines (dSph) was decreased in virus-infected nymphs.</s><s>Consistently, HCMV infection also reduced dSph levels in MRC-5 human primary fibroblasts cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Machesky et al. 2008)</ref>.</s><s>It remains to be determined whether cells attempt to combat viral infection by lowering the level of dSph and sphingosine or decreased dSph facilitates viral infection.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, many sphingolipid-metabolizing enzymes are highly conserved between L. striatellus and other insects.</s><s>The expression of these sphingolipid-metabolizing enzymes is regulated during infection of L. striatellus by RSV, which leads to changes in the levels of ceramides and dSph in L. striatellus.</s><s>The alteration in these sphingolipids may facilitate RSV to infect L. striatellus or is an adaptive mechanism by which L. striatellus limits RSV infection.</s><s>The identification of these genes lays a molecular foundation to define the role of sphingolipids in controlling L. striatellus infection by RSV.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"
