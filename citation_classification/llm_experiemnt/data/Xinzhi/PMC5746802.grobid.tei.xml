thus, the state's economy, as well as its labor/work force, greatly depends upon the citrus industry thriving.</s><s>Recently, the Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemptera: Liviidae), has emerged as a major biological factor affecting citrus production.</s><s>Diaphorina citri is a pest of Asian origin, and a vector of one of the most destructive pathogens of citrus, 'Candidatus Liberibacter' species, which is a phloem-limited bacterium associated with citrus greening disease, or 'huanglongbing' (HLB), worldwide <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>.</s><s>In Florida, the fruit and farming industry has taken a direct hit, reporting a 23% decline in cumulative citrus production and an associated 48% job losses within five years of the detection of HLB disease in the state <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>In a recent report, USDA-NIFA <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref> forecasted a further decline in citrus production for Florida of over a 70% reduction compared to 1997-1998 production levels.</s><s>Considering the severity of damage and economic loss associated with this disease, current control strategies rely heavily on the use of chemical insecticides for the control of the vector.</s><s>Although a range of synthetic chemical insecticides is effective against the psyllid <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, recent studies suggest that these intensive psyllid control programs have not been successful in mitigating the spread of HLB disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>.</s><s>Excessive reliance on the selective insecticides for the control of psyllids has resulted in reduced susceptibility of the pest against a variety of insecticides, including pyrethroids, carbamates, organophosphates and neonicotinoids <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>.</s><s>A chemically driven psyllid management program could impact beneficial populations present in the groves, and thwart the parasitic wasp-based classical biological control programs being implemented for D. citri <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, there are challenges in the application of chemical insecticides for the residential trees and abandoned citrus groves that serve as a reservoir of HLB disease.</s></p><p><s>Considering the importance of alternative low-risk insecticides for psyllid control, researchers have evaluated horticultural mineral oils (HMOs, refined petroleum oil) and entomopathogenic fungi for their potential integration in citrus management programs <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>Qureshi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> found that refined petroleum oil, when used alone, did not provide adequate suppression of D. citri, because the mean adult and nymphal suppression was only 36% and 50%, respectively, for &lt;3 weeks.</s><s>When used as an adjuvant, HMO improved the efficacy of synthetic chemical insecticides compared to insecticides applied without HMO.</s><s>Furthermore, HMO provided control for additional citrus pests including leafminer and rust mites.</s><s>Among the entomopathogenic fungi, the utility of Isaria fumosorosea Wise against D. citri has been reported by several authors in Florida <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr">[24]</ref>].</s><s>However, the potential impact of agrochemicals such as HMO routinely applied in citrus production has not been broadly investigated.</s><s>Therefore, considering this lack of information on the interaction of HMO with I. fumosorosea, in the current study, we assessed the compatibility of selected refined petroleum oils with I. fumosorosea and their combined effect on survivorship of D. citri adults.</s><s>We believe the outcome of Insects 2017, 8, 119 3 of 11 this study will help promote the adoption of I. fumosorosea-based eco-friendly management programs of D. citri and other citrus pests <ref type="bibr">[24]</ref> and improve their potential role in preventing insecticide resistance.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p><s>Isaria fumosorosea has been isolated from mycosed D. citri on the foliage of orange trees in Polk County, Florida <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, suggesting that this naturally occurring fungus should be tested under different abiotic and biotic parameters to determine if it can be promoted as a good microbial candidate for citrus pest management.</s><s>As of 2017, there are two blastospore strains (Apopka 97 and ARSEF 3581) of I. fumosorosea available for research, of which only the Apopka 97 strain contained in the formulated product PFR-97 20% WDG is commercially available for use in field/food crops, including citrus <ref type="bibr">[24]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, it is imperative to screen it at various variables before recommending it to growers.</s><s>The use of refined petroleum oils as an adjuvant is one such test.</s><s>Among several advantages of using I. fumosorosea (Apopka 97 strain) against D. citri is its adaptability to the native climatic conditions (temperature 24-30 • C + high humidity) and efficacy against a wide range of citrus pests, including psyllids, mealybugs, leafminers and plant bugs <ref type="bibr">[24]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>There are three kinds of interactions (antagonistic, synergistic or neutral) that can be expected when a chemical is mixed with entomopathogenic fungi <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</s><s>In our current study, we did not observe any negative impact by the petroleum oils on the growth parameters, i.e., CFUs and radial diameter estimates of I. fumosorosea.</s><s>Rather, a synergistic effect on the potency of I. fumosorosea with Orchex and JMS was observed (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>).</s><s>Similar results for the impact of oils on entomopathogenic fungal activity against hemipteran pests have been reported previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>.</s><s>In addition, the FDI value for the Orchex, Conoco Blend -2, and JMS treatments reached beyond 2.5 by the end of the study period, and was significantly higher than the value in I. fumosorosea (0.6 ± 0.23) treatment alone.</s><s>This indicates that the tested spray oils promote the hyphal growth of fungus and may help colonize on the substrate or insect cuticle, as well as increase the potential fungal horizontal transmission to the conspecifics in the sprayed regions.</s><s>Although we did not identify the mechanism behind the additive effect of the HMOs on the activity of I. fumosorosea, we hypothesize that it could be due to improved adherence of the blastospores on the lipophilic psyllid surface.</s></p><p><s>In the present study, we did not compare the impact of I. fumosorosea on the efficacy of HMOs against the adult psyllid.</s><s>However, in a related study conducted under similar conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, combination treatment of I. fumosorosea and oils significantly reduced the survivability of psyllid adults when compared to oils applied alone.</s><s>In another study, Cuthbertson and Collins <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> reported that a significantly higher mortality of the second instar larvae of another hemipteran pest, Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius), was observed after application of mixed treatments of petroleum horticultural oil, Tri-Tek, and the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana, than for each of the treatments applied alone under glasshouse conditions.</s><s>These studies together suggest that there is potential in using HMOs and entomopathogenic fungi in an integrated management program for invasive pests; nonetheless, the compatibility of the selected products must be assessed and ensured before testing them in production systems.</s></p><p><s>Because citrus is a very high value crop, we do acknowledge the limitations of using entomopathogenic fungi over chemical insecticides for psyllid control, especially in regions where HLB has been detected previously.</s><s>It takes about two days for I. fumosorosea to infect and kill D. citri adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> under controlled conditions, whereas acquisition and transmission of HLB by D. citri may occur within 24 h post-feeding <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</s><s>In such a scenario, growers do not have many options other than selecting pesticides that provide instantaneous control of pests to minimize the risk of spreading disease.</s><s>Thus, we speculate that the results of the current study may not be readily transferable to Florida citrus growers battling psyllid problems in their field, as there are additional factors that could affect fungal efficacy under field conditions; nevertheless, they could be useful elsewhere, where HLB is not a major issue.</s><s>However, our results are encouraging for the concerted efforts of researchers involved in improving the utility of entomopathogenic fungi in abandoned citrus groves and residential trees (acting as HLB reservoir), where chemical control of citrus is problematic and not economical for the growers.</s><s>Currently, several researchers in Florida and elsewhere are working towards finding effective tools to mitigate psyllids in such areas, and this work is an additional step in that direction.</s><s>Furthermore, we believe that the outcome of the study will be important for growers engaged in the citrus nursery businesses, and controlled citrus production systems also known as CUPS (Citrus Under Protective Screen), where, apart from psyllids, other soft-bodied arthropods such as thrips, leafminers, and citrus mites are the major issues.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p><s>Considering the importance of alternative management practices and insecticide resistance management for citrus pests, the current study highlights three major findings: (1) selected HMOs are compatible with the entomopathogenic fungus I. fumosorosea at applied rates; (2) as an adjuvant, they improve the efficacy of I. fumosorosea against D. citri adults; and, most importantly, (3) they enhance the FDI value on dead cadavers, which is important for the existence of the entomopathogenic fungus in the affected region for longer durations as a result of the horizontal transmission of the spores to conspecifics, as well as other citrus pests.</s><s>Our data provides additional support for using HMOs in combination with entomopathogenic fungi (mycoinsecticides); however, each HMO needs to be tested and evaluated for compatibility before being applied under field conditions.</s><s>Including a mixed treatment of HMO and I. fumosorosea into the spray rotation, especially in the early spring or late fall, may enhance psyllid suppression without introducing a selection agent at the same time, and thus potentially provide the growers with an additional management tool.</s><s>Future studies will focus on evaluating the residual efficacy of the tank mix suspension of HMOs and I. fumosorosea under field and CUPS for control of citrus pests.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1.</s><s>Viability and infection parameters of Isaria fumosorosea on the Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri alone and after being mixed with horticultural oil treatments: (A) I. fumosorosea CFUs growing on potato dextrose agar; (B) radial growth of I. fumosorosea with HMO (left) compared to control (right); (C) D. citri adult previously having fed on the midrib vein of a citrus leaf disk inside of the bioassay chamber, which is now dead, infected with I. fumosorosea and attached to the leaf by the fungus growing through the tarsi; (a) eggs laid previous to adult psyllid death are now infected; (b) honeydew droplet deposited after feeding inside bioassay chamber; (D) Colonization of adult D. citri by fungus and production of conidia on the phialides extending away from the infected wings onto the leaf; note the fungus horizontal growth from the mycosed insect into the surrounding area.</s></p></div></figDesc></figure>
