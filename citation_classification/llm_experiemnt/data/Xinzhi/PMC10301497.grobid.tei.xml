the use of oxytetracycline as an injected antibiotic has now been approved with a 24(c) special local needs label <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>However, antibiotic effectiveness is inconsistent <ref type="bibr">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>, and their application is especially challenging for phloem-limited pathogens <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>Further, while the use of insecticides and antibiotics have shown limited and highly variable effectiveness on HLB, their potential negative impacts on beneficial and non-targeted microorganisms and insects have been well documented <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>.</s><s>Nevertheless, in the continuous attempt to address both immediate and long-term concerns of HLB, an array of diversified strategies (nutrition and water management, protective screening, breeding, small peptide molecules, gibberellic acid and antioxidants, biocontrol of vector, etc.) are being pursued in the attempt to manage orchards and maintain productivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>Still, each strategy is dependent on a variety of factors, with its own set of limitations and varying degrees of effectiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, no available treatment options are sufficient for commercial HLB control <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>;

For isolation of bacterial endophytes, three 5 mm stem fragments were ground using a mortar and pestle with 1 mL of sterile DI water to obtain a homogenate solution; 100 µL of the homogenate solution was transferred onto 90 mm TSA Petri plates containing cycloheximide (100 µg mL -1 ) and were incubated for 5-10 days at 28 • C. Isolates were differentiated based on morphology (colony shape and color), pigmentation and growth rates, and each distinct bacterial and fungal colony was subcultured for isolation using the streak plate or hyphal tip method.</s><s>Bacterial cultures exhibiting extensive colony spreading and/or biofilm growth were further subcultured on TSA amended with 75 µg mL -1 of p-nitrophenylglycerol (NPG) for inhibition of surface colony spreading <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>Once pure cultures were confirmed for each endophyte, morphological characteristics of all isolates were recorded.</s></p></div>

given that Bacillus have the ability to colonize internal plant tissue <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> and that B. amyloliquefaciens are among the most successful biological control agents <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref>, our results are encouraging.</s></p><p><s>Thus, the five strains of B. amyloliquefaciens identified in the present study hold significant potential to become the first sustainable anti-CLas treatment agents for HLB control.</s><s>In addition, given that B. amyloliquefaciens may induce the immune responses of HLB-infected citrus <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">72]</ref> and that in the present study five strains of B. amyloliquefaciens demonstrated strong antimicrobial activity directly against CLas, it is possible that B. amyloliquefaciens may actually provide dual-benefits (both direct and indirect) simultaneously to their citrus host trees.</s><s>Nevertheless, given the complexities of the Bacillus phylogeny and the limitations of species identification based on 16S rRNA <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref>, as well as the fact that numerous strains of antimicrobial-producing B. amyloliquefaciens species have already been documented, additional sequence analyses (whole genome) are needed for complete taxonomic identification of each of these five anti-CLas isolates.</s></p><p><s>Huanglongbing has led to permanent changes in the management practices of citrus globally.</s><s>Since Florida citrus trees are already infected, efficient management requires effective and sustainable treatment options to help infected trees maintain health and productivity.</s><s>To accomplish this, citrus growers should have access to a diverse set of effective HLB prevention and mitigation tools.</s><s>As such, endophytes offer remarkable potential for the discovery and development of novel anti-CLas therapeutics with multiple modes of action to reduce resistance.</s><s>Further, an endophyte-based bioactive product for biological control of HLB would constitute a novel sustainable treatment option for citrus growers, promoting long-term disease suppression and reducing the need for chemical inputs.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p><s>The availability of sustainable HLB management options is critical to the survival of the citrus industry.</s><s>Still, despite extensive efforts, citrus production continues to plummet.</s><s>The development of effective treatment options has been hindered by the fastidious nature of the CLas pathogen, limiting experimental methods primarily to the use of surrogate organisms and in planta studies.</s><s>In the present study, the sequential use of two surrogate organisms led to the selection of five high-potential anti-CLas candidates, which were evaluated directly against CLas in vitro, under a v-qPCR-based psyllid homogenate assay.</s><s>Here, we measured the effectiveness of the antimicrobial activity (produced by the endophytic isolates) against CLas.</s><s>The CFCS of five endophytic strains of B. amyloliquefaciens were each found to statistically reduce the number of intact CLas cells when compared to the control.</s><s>While these results are promising, they entail the need for further exploration.</s><s>Future studies require the identification and characterization of the bioactive fractions in the CFCS as well as in planta analysis of both the bacterial suspensions and their bioactive fractions.</s><s>All in all, stems from organically managed survivor citrus trees were found to harbor CLasantagonistic endophytes as part of their aboveground microbiome.</s><s>As such, these naturally derived anti-CLas agents hold significant potential for HLB management, potentially increasing yield and productivity while reducing environmental impacts.</s><s>Finally, an effective anti-CLas agent capable of entering the host's vascular tissue could provide a unique opportunity for growers to become more sustainable in their management practices and ameliorate the crisis of the citrus industry.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1.</s><s>Leaf disks from HLB-symptomatic trees were submerged in 200 µL of treatment solution for 48 h.</s><s>Treatments included a no-treatment control, streptomycin, oregano (Origanum vulgare), Christmas bush (Alchornea cordifolia), thyme (Thymus vulgaris), cinnamon (Cinnamomum aromaticum), and turmeric (Curcuma longa).</s><s>Leaf disks were frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground to a fine powder for phenol extraction (Tris-EDTA buffer solution), followed by qPCR with CLas sequence-specific primers (LL, Las-Long).</s><s>Results are shown as mean Ct values for CLas with standard error of the mean.</s></p></div></figDesc></figure>
