showed that genes associated with the GO terms abscisic acid binding (GO:0010427) and hormone binding (GO:0042562) were upregulated in alfalfa plants infested with aphids or infected by P.

aphids or infected by P. medicaginis, and in plants exposed to both aphid infestation and pathogen infection.</s></p><p><s>The RNA-Seq results also revealed that genes associated with the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway -plant (map04016) were upregulated in alfalfa infested with aphids and infected with P. medicaginis.</s><s>The MAPK cascades play a role in
