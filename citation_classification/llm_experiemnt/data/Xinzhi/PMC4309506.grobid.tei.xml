reveal significant differentiation between populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> .</s></p><p><s>An alternative view is that outbreaks are caused by long-distance migration events.</s><s>Potential to migrate is indicated by catches of a considerable number of SBPH at high altitudes or over the sea with N. lugens and S. furcifera, two species which annually migrate to China from the Indochina Peninsula riding the air currents in the early spring <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> .</s><s>Moreover, a comparison of insecticide susceptibility between Chinese and Japanese populations coupled with a backward trajectory analysis indicated that SBPH can fly from China to Japan <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> .</s><s>Accordingly, extensive gene flow between populations was suggested by a phylogenetic analysis in China based on a fragment of the Cytochrome C Oxidase Subunit II (COII), which showed that identical or highly similar haplotypes were shared between different geographic populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> .</s><s>These observations suggest that SBPH, like N. lugens and S. furcifera, is able to migrate long distances.</s></p><p><s>Conventional methods for studying the movement of insects include fluorescent marker dyes and radio-isotopes.</s><s>However, these methods are difficult to apply to SBPH because of their small size, short lifespan, large population sizes, and rapid aerial population dilution <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> .</s><s>An indirect approach is to use molecular markers that will give us access to genetic parameters partially linked to actual demographic parameters.</s><s>Genetic structure inferred from molecular markers reflects the interaction of genetic drift, mutation, migration and selection, with influences from life history.</s><s>For example, highly migratory species are usually expected to have low genetic differentiation and minimal population structure because of strong gene flow.</s><s>In spite of the difficult challenge of linking genetics and demographic population parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> , population genetics have been successfully employed to elucidate the flight behavior or migratory ability of a range of insect species <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> .</s><s>However, there is not yet any conclusive evidence for the population genetic structure of SBPH.</s><s>The molecular markers (allozymes or COII gene), numbers of samples (9,281)  and sample types (laboratory reared populations or natural populations) used in previous studies have led to contradictory results and limited ability to reveal the reliable pattern of its population structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Furthermore, by its influence in shaping host population genetics, infection by the endosymbiotic bacterium Wolbachia, which is common in SBPH <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> , may at least partially explain the contradictory results of previous studies.</s><s>Wolbachia is a maternally inherited alpha-proteobacteria and induces cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) in SBPH, a mechanism by which mating between uninfected females and infected males results in no offspring.</s><s>However, the infected females can mate with both the infected and uninfected males, and produce offsprings successfully.</s><s>The CI level of SBPH is quite high and even old males strongly cause CI <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> .</s><s>Because of the reproductive advantage of Wolbachia-infected females, even a small number of Wolbachia-infected insects can lead to a rapid spread and fixation of the infection.</s><s>In association with Wolbachia spread, a small number of mitochondrial haplotypes borne by infected individuals are also spread within populations, reducing the mitochondrial diversity of populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> .</s><s>Moreover, CI can prevent gene flow from infected to uninfected populations, promoting genetic divergence <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> , and has attracted attention as a possible mechanism for rapid speciation <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> .</s><s>Thus, the high CI level in SBPH can bias measurements of diversity and structure estimated by mtDNA markers in its populations.</s><s>However, if complemented with data from nuclear markers, the effect of CI on the population structure of its host can be assessed and controlled.</s><s>Simultaneously, the Wolbachia infection status (infection frequencies and Wolbachia strains) of different SBPH geographic populations per se will provide information on the population structure and dispersal ability.</s></p><p><s>In this study, we set out to explore the following two questions: (1) Does SBPH show evidence of a high level of dispersal from popu-lation genetic data?</s><s>If this is the case, we expect a low level of genetic differentiation between populations and no isolation-by-distance effect.</s><s>(2) Does Wolbachia affect the mitochondrial DNA genetic diversity and structure of SBPH populations?</s><s>If this is the case, we expect a low level of genetic diversity at mitochondrial markers and congruent geographic structures of Wolbachia and mitochondrial genomes.</s><s>To address these questions, we evaluated the spatial genetic variation in 26 SBPH populations sampled from most of the species' range in China.</s><s>To gain a reliable picture of genetic variation, we employed three different types of molecular markers: (i) 13 microsatellite loci that had previously been published <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref>  (6) or were presently identified from an expressed library (7); (ii) two mitochondrial DNA gene sequences (COI and COII); and (iii) the multilocus sequence typing of Baldo et al.

haplogroups to different climates.</s><s>The finding that the mitochondrial HGI frequencies were significantly correlated with the first PCA axis (even when the IBD effect was removed) may indicate that temperature plays an important role in shaping the distributions of mitochondrial haplogroups.</s><s>Considering the low winter temperatures in the MT zone (the mean winter temperatures of the four sampling sites in the MT zone range from 217.1 to 212.0uC), the enrichment of HGI in the MT zone may indicate that the HGI mitochondrial haplotype (or another allele at another locus it is linked
