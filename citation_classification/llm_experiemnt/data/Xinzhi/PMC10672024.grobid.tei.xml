usually overwinter on plants of the neighboring vineyard vegetation.</s><s>Nymphs and adults feed on green plant tissues by sucking the leaf parenchyma cell contents reducing the photosynthetic rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>Heavily infested leaves dry out, which has a major consequence on the reduction in the sugar content in the berries <ref type="bibr"

molecular data that are collected from phylogenetic studies aim to contribute to a better understanding of the genetics and evolution of different species or within populations of the same species,

one of the most accurate molecular detection biomarkers for species differentiation, and barcoding analysis can be used to investigate phylogenetic relationships at the genus level and to illuminate
