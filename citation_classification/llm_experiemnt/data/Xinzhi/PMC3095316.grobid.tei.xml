<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Background: Lipoxygenase (LOXs) is a large family of plant enzymes that catalyse the hydroperoxidation of free polyunsaturated fatty acids into diverse biologically active compounds, collectively named phyto-oxylipins.</s><s>Although multiple isoforms of LOXs have been identified in a wide range of annual herbaceous plants, the genes encoding these enzymes in perennial woody plants have not received as much attention.</s><s>In Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze, no LOX gene of any type has been isolated, and its possible role in tea plant development, senescence, and defence reaction remains unknown.</s><s>The present study describes the isolation, characterization, and expression of the first tea plant LOX isoform, namely CsLOX1, and seeks to clarify the pattern of its expression in the plant's defence response as well as in flower opening and senescence.</s></p><p><s>Results: Based on amino acid sequence similarity to plant LOXs, a LOX was identified in tea plant and named CsLOX1, which encodes a polypeptide comprising 861 amino acids and has a molecular mass of 97.8 kDa.</s><s>Heterologous expression in yeast analysis showed that CsLOX1 protein conferred a dual positional specificity since it released both C-9 and C-13 oxidized products in equal proportion and hence was named 9/13-CsLOX1.</s><s>The purified recombinant CsLOX1 protein exhibited optimum catalytic activity at pH 3.6 and 25°C.</s><s>Real-time quantitative PCR analysis showed that CsLOX1 transcripts were detected predominantly in flowers, up-regulated during petal senescence, and down-regulated during flower bud opening.</s><s>In leaves, the gene was up-regulated following injury or when treated with methyl jasmonate (MeJA), but salicylic acid (SA) did not induce such response.</s><s>The gene was also rapidly and highly induced following feeding by the tea green leafhopper Empoasca vitis, whereas feeding by the tea aphid Toxoptera aurantii resulted in a pattern of alternating induction and suppression.</s><s>Conclusions: Analysis of the isolation and expression of the LOX gene in tea plant indicates that the acidic CsLOX1 together with its primary and end products plays an important role in regulating cell death related to flower senescence and the JA-related defensive reaction of the plant to phloem-feeders.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p><s>Phyto-oxylipins, which are among the important active components of plant cells, play diverse roles in several physiological events including plant growth and development, senescence, and defence against pathogens and pests as well as abiotic sources of stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>.</s><s>Most phyto-oxylipins are derived from the lipoxygenase (LOX) pathway, which contains at least seven multienzyme branches.</s><s>Of these enzymes, lipoxygenase is the first step and a key enzyme.</s><s>Plant LOX (linoleate: oxygen oxidoreductase, EC 1.13.11.12) is a large family of non-heme iron-containing enzymes that catalyse the addition of molecular oxygen to linoleic acid (C18:2) and linolenic acid (C18:3) at either C9 or C13 position, with 9S-or 13S-hydroperoxides as the primary product, and hence are referred to as 9-or 13-LOX <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>Plant LOXs can be further divided into two gene subfamilies, type 1 and type 2, based on the N-terminal chloroplast transit peptide sequence.</s><s>The type 1 subfamily lacks a plasmid transit peptide and consists of both 9-and 13-LOXs, and the type 2 subfamily possesses 13-LOXs, which have a chloroplast transit peptide <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>Both 9Sand 13S-hydroperoxides are rapidly converted into a series of biologically active molecules by the action of the LOX pathway enzymes, and are therefore referred to as phyto-oxylipins <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The highest LOX activity was observed in soybean during leaf growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, and LOX activity level was reported as being positively correlated with the rate of elongation of an organ <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>Potato LOX1 is expressed during tuber growth, and its antisense suppression resulted in smaller tubers <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>Maize LOX3 (ZMLOX3) knockout mutants showed shorter roots and increased senescence <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>The olive 9/13-LOX gene is predominantly expressed during fruit ripening and is believed to be associated with senescence in the plant <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>A similar observation was made in kiwifruit LOXs <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>Some LOXs, such as r9-LOX1 and OsLOX1 in rice <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref> and PdLOX in almond <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, were found to be involved in germination.</s><s>However, there is little information on the role of LOXs in flower bud opening and petal expansion.</s><s>Physiological and biochemical analyses show that lipid content changes and the cellular membrane is degraded during flower senescence <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref> and that lipid oxidation is either due to increased LOX activity or independent of LOX <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>Increased LOX activity prior to obvious senescence of flowers has been shown in many plants including carnation <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, day lily <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, and rose <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>In Petunia inflata, a highly up-regulated allene oxide synthase (AOS) gene involved in petal senescence was identified and assumed to have a role in programmed cell death <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> whereas in Alstroemeria peruviana and two orchid species, no increase in LOXspecific activity was observed over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>.</s><s>It is likely that the function of LOXs during petal senescence varies from species to species <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> and needs further study.</s></p><p><s>The expression LOX genes is most frequently observed in the response of plants to pest attack, particularly that of many annual herbaceous plants to insects <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>.</s><s>Transcripts encoding LOX genes were strongly induced during plant-aphid interactions including Myzus euphorbiase feeding on tomato leaves <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and M. nicotianae sucking the sap from Nicotiana attenuata <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>The cabbage BoLOX was up-regulated by several herbivores such as caterpillars (Pieris rapae, P. brassicae, and Mamestra brassicae), spider mites (Tetranychus urticae), and locusts (Schistocerca gregaria) but not by aphids (M.</s><s>persicae) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s>In rice, two LOX genes are involved in the plant's response to stress brought about by herbivores: the OsLOX1 transcript was rapidly and abundantly induced by the brown planthopper (BPH) Niaparvata lugens <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, and the OsHI-LOX, which was expressed only slightly by BPH but strongly by a chewing insect, namely the striped stem borer (SSB) Chilo suppressalis <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s>The antisense-mediated depletion of LOX gene suggests that its role in plant defence varies with the type of herbivore.</s><s>Silencing the NaLOX3 made N. attenuata unable to produce defensive compounds and hence more susceptible to the chewing insect Manduca sexta <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>; however, in the field the transformed plants are susceptible to many herbivores, including a new opportunistic phloem-feeder, the leafhopper Empoasca sp., which does not select the wild-type N. attenuata <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s>Transgenic rice with sense or antisense OsLOX1 would increase or decrease the resistance to BPH <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>It is noteworthy that antisense expression of rice OsHI-LOX encourages chewing herbivores but deters the phloem-feeder <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s>LOX genes are less commonly observed in woody perennials than in herbaceous annuals.</s><s>The tea plant, being a perennial, is exposed to pests for longer time and being larger, presents a greater expanse for pestsa study of expression patterns of its LOX genes in response to attack by herbivores therefore assumes importance.</s></p><p><s>The tea plant, Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze, is not only one of the world's most important woody plantation crops but is also valued as a source of secondary metabolic products including phyto-oxylipins.</s><s>Tender tea buds and leaves are usually plucked and processed to produce high-grade tea as a beverage.</s><s>Tea flowers emit plenty of aromatic volatiles to attract bees and wasps and have become a major source of honey <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</s><s>However, tea is also attacked by herbivores such as tea green leafhoppers and aphids.</s><s>As a defence mechanism, tea can emit specific volatile organic compounds (VOCs) or change the relative proportions of many components of the VOCs, which may attract predators and parasites -natural enemies of the herbivores -to keep the pests in check <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>.</s><s>As the first step to elucidating the function of tea plant oxylipins in development and defence, we worked on isolating and characterizing a tea plant LOX gene, namely CsLOX1.</s><s>Purification and biochemical analysis of the recombinant protein showed that CsLOX1 is a dual position-specific lipoxygenase producing both C-9 and C-13 HPOs.</s><s>The CsLOX1 was expressed predominantly in flowers, but differentially regulated during flower opening and senescence.</s><s>We also studied the dynamics of CsLOX1 expression patterns in leaves following mechanical wounding, hormone treatment, and attack by two phloem-feeders (tea green leafhopper and tea aphid) and the role of CsLOX1 in flower development and defence against insect attack.</s></p></div>
