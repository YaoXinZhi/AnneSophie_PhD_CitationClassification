<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p><s>As plants are restricted in their mobility, they have evolved sophisticated strategies to adapt to their constantly changing environment.</s><s>Plants are challenged not only by abiotic stresses but also by phytopathogenic microorganisms and herbivores, all of which exploit the plants as sources of nutrients.</s><s>Thus, plant defense is a complex, multifaceted system in which physical barriers, chemical compounds and defense proteins intertwine and adapt to counter these vastly different attackers.</s><s>Chemical defenses are as versatile as the secondary metabolites involved, which can be repellent, antinutritional or toxic, and may even attract natural enemies of herbivores <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Croteau et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Mithöfer and Boland, 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Similarly, proteinaceous defenses also act on multifarious fronts.</s><s>For example, they contribute to strengthening the mechanical barriers through protein agglutination or crosslinking to cell wall components <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Rashid, 2016)</ref>.</s><s>Harmful proteins or enzymes can directly target structures in pathogens or herbivores <ref type="bibr">(Edreva, 2005)</ref>.</s><s>For instance, chitinases possess antifungal activity by cleaving fungal cell wall components <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Kumar et al., 2018)</ref>, and lectins impair carbohydrate structures in the insect gut, which has detrimental consequences for the herbivore <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Vandenborre et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, enzymes produced by pathogens or herbivores can be inhibited in the apoplast or the insect gut.</s><s>For example, the overexpression of protease inhibitors impaired fungal growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Yarullina et al., 2016)</ref> and reduced the survival of beetles <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Delledonne et al., 2001)</ref>.</s><s>Plants overexpressing inhibitors targeting α-amylases were more resistant than the wild-type plants and drastically decreased the survival of several beetle species <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Kaur et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Enzymes macerating the plant cell wall are versatile, and inhibiting them enhanced plant resistance to various pathogens <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Kalunke et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Ma et al., 2017)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>A fascinating example of such enzyme inhibitors are polygalacturonase-inhibiting proteins (PGIPs).</s><s>These extracellular leucine-rich repeat (LRR) proteins are ubiquitously distributed in plants <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Kalunke et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Localized in the plant cell wall <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Spadoni et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Protsenko et al., 2008)</ref>, they bind and inhibit polygalacturonases (PGs, EC 3.2.1.15) of the glycoside hydrolase family 28 (GH28) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(De Lorenzo et al., 2001)</ref>.</s><s>PGs hydrolyze pectin, a galacturonic acid-rich polysaccharide of the plant cell wall <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Mohnen, 2008)</ref>.</s><s>The inhibition of PG activity by PGIPs restricts tissue maceration and favors the formation of oligogalacturonides, which elicit plant defenses <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(De Lorenzo et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">De Lorenzo and Ferrari, 2002)</ref>.</s><s>Additionally, PGIPs can protect pectin by binding to and thus shielding the substrate from degradation <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Spadoni et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Protsenko et al., 2008)</ref>.</s><s>Some PGIPs are constitutively expressed, whereas others are induced in response to various environmental cues such as wounding, the presence of oligogalacturonides, pathogen infection or herbivory <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Li et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">D'Ovidio et al., 2004b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Hwang et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Kirsch et al., 2020)</ref>.</s><s>PGIPs have been studied best and extensively reviewed in the context of plant-microbe interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(De Lorenzo et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Kalunke et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Rathinam et al., 2020)</ref>.</s><s>PGs, secreted into the apoplast upon infection, often represent pathogenicity factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Isshiki et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Oeser et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bravo Ruiz et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>Hence, reduced PGIP levels in plants led to increased susceptibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Ferrari et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Hou et al., 2015)</ref>, whereas overexpression of PGIPs contributed to plant resistance to phytopathogens and also reduced disease symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Powell et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Ferrari et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Manfredini et al., 2005)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Besides their abundance in microbes, PGs are also widespread in insects

target="#b22">D'Ovidio et al., 2004b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Frati et al., 2006)</ref> and the resistance of mung bean (Vigna radiata) to seed beetles (Callosobruchus spp.) was associated with genes encoding putative PGIPs <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Chotechung et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Kaewwongwal et al., 2020)</ref>.</s><s>We recently found BrPGIP3 from Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa ssp.</s><s>pekinensis) to be a potent inhibitor of individual PGs from the mustard leaf beetle Phaedon cochleariae as well as of gut PG activity in vitro <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Haeger et al., 2020)</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, P. cochleariae larvae were negatively influenced in vivo by the presence of PGIPs in different Arabidopsis thaliana lines <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Kirsch et al., 2020)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Polygalacturonases -like their antagonist, PGIPs -often belong to large multi-gene families, which have been shaped by an evolutionary arms race <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Casasoli et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>In the PG-PGIP interaction, specificity is maintained by a few positively selected amino acid hotspots <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Casasoli et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Rathinam et al., 2020)</ref>.</s><s>Exchanging a single amino acid in the PG or PGIP may alter their reciprocal recognition, allowing proteins to bind novel partners or an existing interaction to be circumvented <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Leckie et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Benedetti et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Chen et al., 2019)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, expanding the number of PG genes may facilitate a subfunctionalization to achieve a more effective pectin degradation, and also be a strategy to escape inhibition by PGIPs.</s><s>Likewise, PGIPs are highly variable in their LRR domain, which is typically involved in proteinprotein interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Kobe and Kajava, 2001)</ref>.</s><s>Such variability has allowed them to flexibly co-evolve with PGs <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Casasoli et al., 2009)</ref>, bind to new ligands and acquire novel functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Meyer et al., 1999)</ref>.</s><s>In P. cochleariae, nine PG family members have been identified in the beetle gut <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Kirsch et al., 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Kirsch et al., , 2014))</ref>; among these, PCO_GH28-1 and other endo-PGs catalyze the random hydrolysis of homogalacturonan, the main component of pectin <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Kirsch et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Interestingly, some PG family members, including PCO_GH28-3, were inactive on all tested substrates and possessed amino acid substitutions in residues involved in catalysis or substrate binding <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Kirsch et al., 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Kirsch et al., , 2014))</ref>.</s><s>Nonetheless, recent findings suggest that these pseudoenzymes play a role in the pectin digestion pathway, because when they were silenced, food-to-energy conversion in P. cochleariae larvae was less efficient compared to when pseudoenzymes were not silenced <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Kirsch et al., 2019)</ref>.</s><s>Even though such pseudoenzymes have also been described in other beetles <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Kirsch et al., 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Kirsch et al., , 2016;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Pauchet et al., 2014)</ref>, their function remains elusive.</s></p><p><s>In this study, we combined affinity purification with proteomics and gene expression analysis to identify several BrPGIPs from B. rapa ssp.</s><s>pekinensis as novel putative inhibitors of the beetle PG PCO_GH28-1.</s><s>A comparison of interacting proteins showed, however, that the pseudoenzyme PCO_GH28-3 was not targeted by any BrPGIPs.</s><s>Surprisingly, two BrPGIPlike proteins interacted with both tested PG family members, and one of the proteins was induced by herbivory.</s><s>Phylogenetic analysis revealed that these BrPGIP-like proteins evolved independently from "classical" PGIPs in the Brassicaceae and clustered together with proteins, which so far have been only linked to developmental processes.</s><s>BrPGIP-like proteins have not previously been associated with the pectin degradation pathway, an association that makes them interesting new candidates for PG inhibitors.</s></p></div>
