<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>There are many microbial organisms pathogenic to insects.</s><s>Almost all of them produce toxins that kill insects exclusively.</s><s>One of these microbial insect pathogens is Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt).</s><s>Bt was discovered in 1901 in Japan as a pathogen of silkworm and later used broadly as a sprayable insecticide. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1)</ref></s><s>he most widely commercialized sprayable Bt formulation utilizes the HD1 strain of Bt subspecies kurstaki.</s><s>This Bt strain has quite a few insecticidal proteins (toxins) such as 135 kDa Cry-1Aa, Cry1Ab, Cry1Ac and Cry1Ia protoxins, 67 kDa Cry2Aa and Cry2Ab naturally matured toxins and possibly more.</s><s>Since Bt insecticidal proteins are produced during the sporulation stage and crystalized in Bt cells (Supplemental Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>), they are called Cry for crystal proteins or toxins.</s><s>When Bt matures dur-ing fermentation, the cells lyse and release free spores and crystals into the culture medium.</s><s>The spore and crystal complex is collected and formulated into sprayable products.</s><s>Each of these HD1 insecticidal proteins has a unique host specificity.</s><s>For example, Cry1Aa is particularly active to Bombyx mori (silkworm) and Trichoplusia ni (cabbage looper) but not active to H. virescens, while Cry1Ac is specific to H. virescens and H. zea but not active to B. mori.</s><s>Cry2A was discovered in the HD1 strain by Yamamoto and McLaughlin, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2)</ref> and Cry2Ab was later used in transgenic cotton to control Helicoverpa armigera (cotton bollworm) because of its high activity to this insect species.</s></p><p><s>Bt Cry insecticidal proteins are stomach poisons that must be ingested by insects and activated by proteases in the insect's digestive system.</s><s>The Cry protein is a powerful feeding inhibitor.</s><s>It works well for transgenic Bt crop applications but not so well for sprayable products.</s><s>Insects stop feeding after they ingest the first bite of Bt Cry proteins sprayed on plants.</s><s>If the bite does not deliver a lethal dose, it would be difficult to kill the insects.</s><s>The efficacy of Bt sprayable formulation persists only a few days after sprayed.</s><s>The insects survived from the first bite can recover and resume feeding.</s><s>This is a reason why sprayable Bt insecticides remain as a niche product.</s><s>However, the feeding inhibition works well for transgenic crop application.</s><s>As long as insects do not feed, the crop is protected.</s><s>Bt insecticidal Cry proteins were applied to transgenic cotton, corn and soybean.</s><s>The first Cry protein used in cotton was Cry1Ac cloned by Adang et al., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3)</ref> and in corn, it was Cry1Ab cloned by Höfte et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4)</ref> Cry1Ac is highly active to H. virescens and H. zea, important cotton pests in the U.S. Cry1Ab is active to O. nubilalis, a major corn pest.</s><s>Their specific activities to the main target pests appear to be in the range of EC 50 =10 ppm or lower than this EC 50 value (i.e., higher activity) in plant tissue.</s><s>Since then, it seems that this high activity level has become a preferred benchmark for other Bt insecticidal proteins used in transgenic crops.</s><s>After O. nubilalis, S. frugiperda became an important pest for corn.</s><s>Cry1Fa replaced Cry1Ab to overcome this problem, as the activity of Cry1Fa against S. frugiperda is within the activity benchmark.</s><s>Cry1Ab is only moderately active to S. frugiperda.</s><s>None of these Bt insecticidal proteins mentioned so far are active to a root-feeding corn pest, D. virgifera.</s><s>To make corn resistant to this soil insect, Bt insecticidal proteins such as Cry3Ab and Cry34/35 were utilized.</s><s>Since D. virgifera is a difficult insect to control with Bt Cry proteins even with Cry3Ab and Cry34/35, it is desired to discover a new potent protein or to optimize an existing one.</s></p><p><s>Since the early 2000s, there have been extensive efforts to find new insecticidal toxins from microorganisms, especially those of Bt.</s><s>Efforts to find new Bt toxins were intensified after Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) became widely used.</s><s>Since most, if not all, Bt insecticidal protein genes are on extrachromosomal plasmids usually huge ones as large as 150 kb, large plasmids of numerous Bt isolates were systematically sequenced to find genes encoding typical Bt Cry amino acid sequences.</s><s>This discovery method of using NGS has dominated old methods such as biochemical identification and/or isolation of Bt Cry proteins.</s><s>So far, many, if not all, newly discovered Cry proteins are not as active as those existing Cry proteins utilized in transgenic plants and/or sprayable pesticides.</s><s>Therefore, the industry shifted their efforts to improve the activity of existing, or even newly discovered, insecticidal proteins of which activities are not as high as those in the commercial products.</s><s>This process of improving the activity by protein engineering is called "optimization" and utilizes various engineering methods as described in this review.</s><s>These methods include domain swapping, DNA shuffling and saturation mutagenesis.</s><s>The latter two methods are employed often in directed evolution.</s><s>Directed evolution mutates a gene to produce many mutant progenies, which are screened in the laboratory for higher fitness to a desired trait, such as higher insecticidal activity.</s><s>Therefore, it is called "directed.</s><s>" The other protein engineering technique is rational design based on the information of structure and function relationship.</s><s>The rational design approach is not reviewed in this article as there have been no noteworthy success cases.</s><s>A possible reason for the lack of success is that the mode of action of Bt Cry insecticidal protein has not been fully resolved.</s></p><p><s>This article is not a comprehensive review of Bt insecticidal proteins unlike the previous article reviewing Bt research and development up to the year 2000. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1)</ref></s><s>Rather, it is focused to review certain methods of protein engineering applied to enhance the insecticidal activity of Bt Cry proteins.</s><s>Most of the contents in this article are based on the research conducted after 2000 by us, i.e., my colleagues and I working together for Sandoz Agro, Maxygen Inc., Pioneer Hi Bred International and DuPont Pioneer.</s><s>All information in this review has been published previously, but it was mostly in oral presentations at scientific meetings, issued patents and patent applications.</s><s>Therefore, some experimental details are included in this review for the benefit of understanding the process of Bt Cry protein optimization.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p><s>In this article, three major protein engineering methods used to optimize Bt Cry proproteins were reviewed.</s><s>They are domain swapping, DNA shuffling and saturation mutagenesis.</s><s>The latter two methods require high throughput screening.</s><s>It was a major undertaking to develop high throughput methods of preparing a large number of protein samples and screening those by insect bioassay, but was proven to be useful for optimizing insecticidal proteins.</s><s>The first case of commercial applications of engineered Bt Cry proteins in Bt-crops was from domain swapping.</s><s>There  had been a concern that the modification of Bt Cry proteins by protein engineering might produce a protein having unexpected traits such as toxicity against non-targets.</s><s>Since the engineered Bt Cry proteins had to go through the stringent government regulatory process such as testing the digestibility in simulated gut fluid down to small, non-allergenic peptides and toxicity against non-target insects and higher animals, the safety was assured.</s><s>However, it took over 10 years to obtain the government approval.</s><s>No commercial GMO crops using Bt Cry proteins optimized by DNA shuffling and saturation mutagenesis have been materialized, because they are relatively new.</s><s>The saturation mutagenesis technology produced 30-fold activity increase over the parent protein, and the optimized Bt Cry1B protein showed outstanding protection of corn from H. zea.</s><s>Nevertheless, it will take many years until a transgenic corn using the Cry proteins optimized by saturation mutagenesis obtains the full government approval.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig. 1.</s><s>Cry3Aa, Cry1Aa and Cry2Aa X-ray structures.</s><s>The receptor binding region of Domain II is shown on the Cry3Aa structure with a red circle.</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="2,327.94,582.66,213.72,108.66" type="bitmap" /></figure>
