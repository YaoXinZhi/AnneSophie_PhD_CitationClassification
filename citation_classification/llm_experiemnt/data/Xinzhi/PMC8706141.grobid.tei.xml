<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p><s>The small brown planthopper (SBPH), Laodelphax striatellus (Fallén) (Hemiptera: Delphacidae) is one of the most serious pests in East Asian rice fields, which not only causes direct damage via sucking rice sap and laying its eggs into rice tissues, but also acts as a viral vector that transmits rice stripe virus (RSV) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>RSV is a typical persistentpropagative plant virus, which is effectively transmitted by SBPH in a persistent and circulative-propagative manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>.</s><s>RSV is ingested when SBPH feed on the rice infected by RSV, and it firstly establishes infection in the midgut epithelium, then spreads to midgut visceral muscle tissues, and ultimately enters the salivary glands, ovaries and other systemic tissues of SBPH under the transportation of hemolymph <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>The virus entering the salivary gland is transmitted to healthy rice plants together with saliva to complete the horizontal transmission <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>The virus binds to vitellogenin (Vg), a precursor of vitellin in the hemolymph, attaches to the nurse cells via Vg receptor (VgR)-mediated endocytosis and then is transovarially transmitted to offspring for vertical transmission in SBPH <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The management of SBPH mainly depends on chemical insecticides, including pymetrozine, imidacloprid, buprofezin, chlorpyrifos, thiamethoxam, and nitenpyram <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>However, widespread application of these insecticides has resulted in the development of resistance and resurgence <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>Besides, the application of neonicotinoid insecticides such as imidacloprid has caused damages to important pollinators such as bees <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>Some studies demonstrated that SBPH has developed resistance to imidacloprid, buprofezin and chlorpyrifos <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>Additionally, the study showed that the application of validamycin and triazophos increases the fecundity of SBPH in rice <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>In the field, insecticides degrade over time or via wind, photolysis and hydrolysis, the concentration of insecticides initially used to control insects decrease until they reach the sublethal levels, resulting in sublethal effects on insects <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>.</s><s>The biological performances and physiological processes of insects would be modified when exposed to sublethal doses of insecticides <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Imidacloprid, a systemic neonicotinoid, acts as on nicotinic acetylcholine receptor via disrupting the neuronal cholinergic signal transduction, is widely used against Hemiptera insects that damage plants via sucking sap <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>.</s><s>Due to its low toxicity to mammals and long-acting to target insects, imidacloprid has been used worldwide to control sucking insect such as rice planthoppers <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>.</s><s>Sublethal effects of imidacloprid have been reported in many insects, e.g., affecting biological performances, changing enzyme activities or influencing gene expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>Several studies suggested that the sublethal concentrations of imidacloprid negatively affected fecundity in exposed insects, such as Bemisia tabaci <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, Sogatella furcifera <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, Rhopalosiphum padi <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, Harmonia axyridis <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, and Ceratomegilla undecimnotata <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>However, exposure to low concentrations of imidacloprid could benefit several insects, including Aphis glycines <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> and Myzus persicae <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s>Meanwhile, Vg and VgR are essential proteins related to the fecundity of females in insects, and mRNA expressions of Vg and VgR could be influenced by sublethal exposure to imidacloprid <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Apoptosis, a programmed cell death process, which eliminates extraneous cells in vertebrates and invertebrates, maintains the normal development and cell homeostasis to reply to external stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</s><s>The enzymes caspases are the main effectors of apoptosis pathway, which are divided into initiators and effectors according to its biological functions.</s><s>Once the initiator caspases are activated, they will initiate the processes of apoptosis, and then the effector caspases will cleave various cell substrates, eventually leading to apoptosis <ref type="bibr">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</s><s>In SBPH, four caspase genes have been identified, including caspase-Nc, caspase-8, caspase-1a and caspase-1c <ref type="bibr">[36]</ref>.</s><s>Much external stress stimuli, including pesticides, could induce apoptosis in insects <ref type="bibr">[37]</ref>.</s><s>Previous studies showed that a variety of pesticides can induce apoptosis in the salivary glands, midguts, ovaries and other tissues of the bees <ref type="bibr">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>.</s><s>After exposure to imidacloprid, apoptosis was stimulated in the honey bees <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref> and bugs <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42,</ref><ref type="bibr">43]</ref>.</s><s>Apoptosis is closely related to the oogenesis of insects.</s><s>Nurse cells in the ovary provide nutrients for the growing of oocytes, and the apoptosis of these nurse cells is crucial to the maturation of oocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>.</s><s>Notably, the fecundity of SBPH was increased by Wolbachia infection, which appeared to be at least partly regulated through caspase-mediated apoptosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>.</s><s>In addition to fecundity, apoptosis is also closely related to the virus transmission of vector insects.</s><s>A recent study showed that infection with tomato yellow leaf curl virus induced the apoptosis pathway in B. tabaci, and the virus-induced apoptosis could increase viral accumulation and transmission in vectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Though sublethal effects of imidacloprid have been investigated in many insects, the effects of sublethal doses of imidacloprid on the viruliferous SBPH remains unclear.</s><s>In the present study, we assessed sublethal effects of imidacloprid on the fecundity, apoptosis, and RSV transmission in SBPH.</s><s>These results will contribute to understanding sublethal doses of imidacloprid-mediated effects on SBPH and provide new insights on pest control.</s></p></div>
