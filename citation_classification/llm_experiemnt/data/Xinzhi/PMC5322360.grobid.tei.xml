type="bibr" target="#b63">64</ref> .</s><s>Reports concerning selection for resistance to entomopathogenic fungi have been mixed.</s><s>Galleria mellonella larvae appeared to develop only minimal resistance to B. bassiana even after 25 generations of selection <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48</ref> .</s><s>However, although significant sublethal effects were seen in surviving generations of B. tabaci exposed to B. bassiana, a gradual reduction in mortality rates was seen in 1 st to 3 rd generations <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> .</s><s>Here we observed little to no changes in susceptibility of B. tabaci to either low or high doses of I fumosorosea after up to 5 generations of selection.</s><s>In addition, similar numbers of eggs were laid by each respective generation, and they remained equally affected by fungal exposure, i.e. a significant decrease in egg laying was noted after I. fumosorosea exposure, however, the effect was similar across the various B. tabaci generations examined.</s><s>These data suggest that in our experimental set-up, no significant resistance development was detected in B. tabaci to I. fumosorosea infection after several generations under fungal selection.</s><s>These observations may also be linked to the observed lack of resistance development in that although these tissues were affected during fungal infection, no significant differences were seen across the fungal-selected whitefly generations, suggesting no carry-over effects on fitness with respect to reproduction that might lead to the development of resistance.</s></p><p><s>Although subtle developmental effects on resistance were not examined in this study, fungal infection was shown to reach the fat body and ovaries of insect adult, resulting in loss of vitellogenin and damage to eggs, an effect readily apparent in in vitro assays where these tissues provided a readily utilizable nutrient source supporting fungal growth.</s><s>In B. tabaci, the number of ovarioles per adult varies between 8 and 18 depending on the time (days) after eclosion, with an average of 13-15 within 12 days <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">65</ref> .</s><s>Examination of dissected ovaries revealed no significant differences in the total number of ovarioles between uninfected and I. fumosorosea treated insects, as well as no differences were seen across the B. tabaci generations (1 st to 5 th ) whether or not they were infected by I. fumosorosea.</s></p><p><s>As cell-free culture supernatants of I. fumosorosea have been shown to be insecticidal <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54</ref> , we also investigated any effects these extracts may have on dissected B. tabaci fat body and ovaries.</s><s>Our data showed that these cell-free extracts have toxigenic activity on immune and reproductive tissues, suggesting a means by which both lethal and sub-lethal effects can be exerted in biological control.</s><s>A number of lethal and sub-lethal effects of cell-free culture supernatants derived from entomopathogenic fungi have been noted.</s><s>Complex outcomes were reported in the application of cell-fee M. anisopliae culture supernatant extracts towards the Mediteranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">66,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">67</ref> .</s><s>Aside from direct toxicity (death), female fly fecundity was reduced upon initial exposure, but little to no effects were seen with respect to the egg fertility or mortality of larvae, although pupae were affected.</s><s>Here we show that the extracts can result in direct damage to tissues in the absence of the presence of the fungal agent itself.</s><s>Damage to the fat body, ovaries, and degradation of vitellogenin was observed in vitro, indicating the presence of toxic compounds in the culture supernatant.</s><s>Although further characterization of the extract is warranted, a number of potential candidate compounds exist.</s><s>Dipicolinic acid (2,6-pyridine dicarboxylic acid, DPA) is known to be an inhibitor of the prophenoloxidase activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> and I. fumosorosea produces abundant amounts of DPA <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68</ref> .</s><s>A wide range of potential insecticidal toxic metabolites have been reported in M. anisopliae and B. bassiana <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref> however work in I. fumosorosea has lagged behind.</s><s>Our data confirm the potential for I. fumosorosea as an agent for B. tabaci control as part of Integrated Pest Management practices and indicate that subsequent generations are likely to continue to be susceptible to the
