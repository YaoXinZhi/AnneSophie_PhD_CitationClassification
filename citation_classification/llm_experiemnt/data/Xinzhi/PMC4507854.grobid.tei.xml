<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>The Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri Kuwayama, 1908 (Hemiptera: Liviidae), has emerged as a major pest in the United States in recent years.</s><s>Since its first detection in Florida in 1998 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, D. citri has spread across all citrus producing states in the U.S. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>.</s><s>Sprawling citrus groves intermingled with abundant dooryard citrus trees that remain largely unmanaged in all commercial citrus producing states, have probably favored the rapid spread of the psyllid.</s></p><p><s>Diaphorina citri is economically important because it is a known vector of Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CLas), the putative bacterial causal agent of citrus greening disease, also called Huanglongbing (HLB) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>.</s><s>Presently, there is no cure for HLB and infected citrus trees gradually decline and produce unmarketable fruit, and eventually die.</s><s>Since D. citri is the primary means of spread of CLas between trees, vector control to prevent the spread of the disease is one of the recommended strategies to mitigate HLB worldwide <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Development of effective management strategies for insect pests requires an understanding of their spatial distribution patterns within the agricultural landscape <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>Despite the uniformity of trees in citrus groves, all development stages of D. citri exhibit an aggregated behavior on flush shoots, where egg laying and immature development occur <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>Adult psyllids are known to move frequently between groves <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, but very little research has investigated the spatial distribution between trees within groves and between groves at the landscape level, and filling this gap will help in the development of more effective psyllid management programs.</s><s>Higher than expected numbers of HLB-infected trees were recorded at the edge of citrus groves in China, Brazil, and Florida, and this observation was attributed to possible psyllid accumulation at the interface or edges of citrus groves <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>.</s><s>In addition to these anecdotal reports on the edge effect in D. citri migration and spatial distribution in citrus groves, other reports have also noted higher psyllid densities and citrus flush shoot infestation levels on the southern and eastern sides of groves <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>Similarly, edge effects were also recorded in the field distribution of potato zebra chip, a disease caused by a Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum and its psyllid vector Bactericera cockerelli (Sulc.)</s><s>(Hemiptera: Psyllidae) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In agricultural landscapes, insect pest population densities can change from the edge to the interior of a habitat, resulting in edge effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>Edge effects in insect spatial distribution may be due to several factors including insect behavior, host plant distribution, availability of oviposition and feeding sites, distribution and densities of natural enemies, windbreaks, and microclimates <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>Edge effects are processes resulting from an abrupt transition between two adjacent ecosystems or patches with differing qualities <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, the edge of a citrus grove may be defined as an interface between a dense citrus planting and an area void of citrus <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>Boundaries of individual citrus blocks can be delineated by roads, irrigation and drainage canals, ponds, another citrus block with distinctive vegetation, any vegetation other than citrus, or any different geographic feature.</s></p><p><s>The spatial distribution and niche occupation of D. citri in citrus are poorly understood.</s><s>Elucidating spatial patterns of this economically important disease vector is important for the development of an effective management program.</s><s>Currently, psyllid control in commercial groves is mostly done via application of insecticides to the whole blocks, without consideration of psyllid location in the block or how psyllid colonization starts within the grove and progresses through the season.</s><s>In this study, we investigated the spatial distribution and niche occupation of all D. citri life stages within citrus blocks, and between blocks on an area-wide basis.</s><s>We also evaluated the pattern of individual grove colonization by adult psyllids.</s><s>The main objective of this study was to determine whether D. citri exhibited an edge effect and niche occupation preference, and to estimate the rate of change of psyllid density from the edge to the interior of the grove.</s><s>The groves are privately owned by two large citrus growing companies (Rio Queen Citrus and Healds Valley) who granted full permission for accessing the groves and conducting these collaborative surveys, which did not involve any endangered or protected species.</s><s>Only the target insect vector D. citri was sampled during the surveys.</s><s>In the study area there were 107 grapefruit blocks covering 415 ha while the 69 sweet orange blocks covered 168 ha, reflecting the species composition of commercial citrus in the LRGV.</s><s>The study area was divided into grid cells of 1,600 m 2 each, and a sampling site was selected at grid corners along the perimeter of a citrus block, independent of the cultivar.</s><s>Sampling site selection was made such that the entire study area was uniformly covered.</s><s>A total of 99 and 54 sampling sites were selected for grapefruit and sweet orange, respectively.</s><s>The location of the citrus grove being sampled relative to the entire study area was recorded as outer or inner blocks when the block was either at the edge or entirely surrounded by other groves in the study area, respectively.</s><s>At each sampling site, three sentinel trees were surveyed.</s><s>The first tree at a corner along the perimeter of the grove labeled as "perimeter tree", the second tree was the adjacent one on the next row inside the grove termed "adjacent tree" and the third tree was a randomly selected tree row within the grove along a diagonal through the perimeter tree from the 8 th to the 10 th row inside the grove labelled as "interior tree".</s><s>Given the diversity of planting densities of groves, the mean distance of the adjacent and interior tree relative to the perimeter tree was calculated as 7 m and 40 m, respectively.</s><s>All surveyed groves belonged to two large citrus companies that use standard grove care practices, including conventional pest control programs.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. citri field colonization and dispersal strategies in field study</head><p><s>A detailed field study to evaluate the field colonization and niche occupation patterns of D. citri adults was conducted in two adjacent 'Rio Red' grapefruit groves (See S2 Fig) <ref type="figure">at</ref> the Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville Citrus Center, Weslaco, Texas, in 2012.</s><s>One of the blocks was a mature block of 12 year old trees, while the second one was a young block of 4 year-old trees.</s><s>Both blocks were sprayed twice during the dormant period (November to early February) of citrus trees in South Texas when no new flush shoots and immature stages of D. citri were present, and did not received any insecticide application for the reminder of the trial.</s><s>Both sprays were done early in the morning between 06:00 and 09:00 using a tractor mounted airblast sprayer delivering about 1,870 L/ha of total spray volume.</s><s>The first spray application on 4 January 2012 was done with fenpropathrin at 0.34 kg/ha (Danitol 2.4 EC, Valent USA Corporation, Walnut Creek, CA) while the second spray was applied on 25 January 2012 with the neonicotinoid imidacloprid at 0.28 kg a.i./ha (Provado 1.6 F, Bayer CropScience, Research Triangle Park, NC).</s></p><p><s>Starting from one week after the second spray application, D. citri adult populations were monitored in the two groves using lime-green sticky card known as ACP-Trap (Alphascents Inc., West Linn, OR) from February to November, corresponding to an average citrus crop season in Texas.</s><s>Five sampling transects were established across all rows in each grove.</s><s>The first and fifth transects were along the first trees at both row-ends of the grove, while the three middle transects were equidistantly placed from the row-end transects.</s><s>Because the young citrus grove has a trapezoidal shape, transect lines were established along the shortest base (See S2 Fig) .</s><s>A trap was deployed on all trees across a transect line, and attached at % 1.5 m above ground directly on tree canopy with a tie such that a sticky surface was facing the outside.</s><s>Using this sampling scheme, traps could be grouped into perimeter, adjacent and interior trees (see S2 Fig) .</s><s>Traps were initially replaced every two weeks until adult psyllids were detected at each trapping location and monthly thereafter.</s><s>Recovered traps were brought to the laboratory, examined under a stereomicroscope, and the number of D. citri adults tallied per trap.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Area-wide surveys and the detailed field study of D. citri population on citrus has led to a better understanding of its spatial niche occupation in groves, habitat preference, and field colonization strategies.</s><s>In both area-wide surveys and the field study D. citri preferentially colonized perimeter trees in the groves and consequently flush shoot infestation levels and densities of all developmental stages were always highest on perimeter trees and gradually declined from the edge to the interior of the grove.</s><s>This strong edge effect in D. citri spatial distribution in citrus  groves may be due to several factors including citrus host plant characteristics and/or D. citri innate behavior.</s><s>In commercial groves, mature citrus trees are large evergreen with dense canopy and perimeter or edge trees are also the first to be encountered by immigrating adults into the grove, and can therefore become a barrier for their arrestment.</s><s>Once settled on these first encountered edge trees, adult psyllids will likely initiate oviposition when trees are flushing as evidenced by the larger numbers of eggs and nymphs on these perimeter trees, thus explaining the highest densities of all life stages observed on those trees relative to trees in other locations in the grove.</s><s>The gradual decline in D. citri flush shoot infestation levels and densities from the edge to the interior of the grove may be a result of cascading within-grove dispersal of D. citri.</s><s>Because D. citri adults move frequently between habitats <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, it is likely that secondary tree to tree colonization within the grove occurs from adult psyllids present on trees close to the edge of the groves.</s><s>The significant and positive relationships obtained between numbers of adult psyllid on perimeter trees and adjacent or interior trees (See S1 Appendix) with explained variances over 90%, clearly indicated that D. citri numbers on adjacent and interior trees were dependent on numbers present on perimeter trees.</s><s>However, D. citri field niche occupation pattern in mature groves was similar to that observed in the young grove where trees did not reach their full size to constitute a close canopy that acts as screen to immigrating adults.</s><s>Such observation may indicate that D. citri preference for border trees is an innate behavior, and not only dependent on tree size.</s><s>D. citri is known to frequently change habitats <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and preferentially living on border trees of the groves will be more conducive to locating suitable habitats.</s><s>Adult psyllid preferentially select young expanding flush shoots for feeding, as these shoots are the only to support egg laying and immature development <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>.</s><s>Edge trees are also characterized by higher illumination and we observed that they tend to produce flush shoots before inner trees in a grove, which can result in earlier D. citri colonization and consequently higher densities.</s><s>The edge effects in D. citri colonization of citrus groves observed in the present study may explain the higher incidence of HLBinfected trees at the edge of citrus groves <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref> due to the presence of higher vector densities and associated risk of inoculum transmission by infective D. citri.</s><s>Similar edge effects have been observed in the spatial distribution of the Japanese beetle, Popillia japonica Newman (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) with higher beetle densities observed on edges of soybean fields than field interior, and specifically downwind hedges harbored more beetles than the other edges <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Numbers of D. citri nymphs and adults significantly varied with host plant cultivar.</s><s>The higher densities of D. citri nymphs and adults on sweet orange than grapefruit indicates that host plant characteristics play an important role in D. citri host plant selection and/or immature survival.</s><s>Patt and Sétamou <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> reported that D. citri exhibited differential attraction to flush shoots of its host plants.</s><s>Higher numbers of adult D citri and flush shoot infestation levels in sweet orange than grapefruit may be the result of higher attraction and colonization of sweet orange groves by immigrating adults.</s><s>Although no significant differences were observed between number of D. citri eggs per flush shoot between grapefruit and sweet orange, higher number of nymphs and adults were recorded on the latter cultivar.</s><s>The comparative number of eggs recorded per flush shoot on both grapefruit and sweet orange suggests that the egg laying behavior of D. citri females is independent of host cultivar once the flush shoot has been selected, or that flush shoots of both citrus cultivars have comparative carrying capacity of D. citri eggs.</s><s>However, the differential number of D. citri nymphs and adults recorded on flush shoots during the surveys showed that D. citri immature survivorship and adult emergence may be higher on sweet orange, suggesting that sweet orange is a more suitable host plant than grapefruit for D. citri development.</s><s>Alves et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>  In addition to flush shoot characteristics, densities of all D. citri developmental stages were dependent on flush cycles in both citrus cultivars (Fig <ref

target="#b23">24]</ref>, and it is therefore not surprising that availability of new flush shoots was intimately related to D. citri population fluctuations.</s><s>An increase in adult D. citri densities was recorded with the onset of a new flush cycle and a decrease was observed when flush shoots mature and no new flush shoots are present in the grove.</s><s>Flores et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> reported similar fluctuation in D. citri adult population in relation to flush cycles in citrus groves.</s><s>Such fluctuations in D. citri populations with tree phenology clearly indicate immigrating adult psyllids are attracted into the groves at the beginning of a flush cycle, while most surviving and newly-emerged adults emigrate from the grove at its completion as shown by the decreasing numbers of adults caught on traps at the end of a flush cycle.</s><s>During the entire field study and area-wide surveys, numbers of D. citri caught on traps or recorded were greatest on perimeter trees.</s><s>This suggests that as observed during immigration, emigrating adults may also aggregate on border trees of a grove before their flight to new habitats or groves, thus explaining the preferential niche occupation of perimeter trees and the border effect observed in D. citri field distribution.</s></p><p><s>D. citri populations and flush shoot infestation levels significantly varied with sampling time.</s><s>Percent flush shoots infested and densities of D. citri eggs and nymphs recorded during the late June to August flush cycles were significantly lower than those observed during any other flush cycle despite the presence of an adult population comparable to spring (Marchearly June) flush cycles (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>).</s><s>Such significant reduction in numbers of D. citri immatures per flush shoot and percentage of flush shoots infested may be due to the high temperature prevailing in South Texas between late June and August.</s><s>During this warm season in South Texas (June-August), 47% of the total daily time is spent in the hot zone with temperature ranging from 29.4 to 37.8°C

citri movement and/or reduce its egg laying potential.</s><s>In summer, citrus flush shoots also tend to mature more rapidly due to high temperature, thus the window of opportunity for D. citri egg laying and/or duration of flush shoot suitability for immature development may be reduced.</s></p><p><s>The edge effect observed in D. citri spatial distribution at the grove level was also recorded at the landscape level with higher D. citri densities and flush shoot infestation levels in groves at the outer edge of the study area than inner groves surrounded by other citrus blocks (Fig 2, S2 Appendix).</s><s>This suggests that D. citri responds positively to its habitat edges, and may be an edge species.</s><s>Such preference of D. citri for edge niches (Figs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>) may be characteristic of an insect species that moves frequently, and presence on outer trees and groves may favor such behavior.</s><s>Grove and landscape edges may fundamentally be different from the interior due to the impact of both abiotic and biotic factors.</s><s>Climatic factors such as wind speed, light intensity, and temperature regimes and differential soil fertility may alter the microclimate and environment of grove and landscape edges that can directly affect citrus tree phenology, D. citri biology and population dynamics, and/or the densities of other arthropod species interacting with D. citri.</s><s>D. citri is mostly a diurnal insect and exhibits a strong phototropism <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, thus explaining its preferential colonization of border trees in a grove with higher illumination.</s></p><p><s>Courtney and Courtney <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> reported higher butterfly oviposition rates on host plants along patch edges because of higher light levels and greater nutrient availability on these plants.</s></p><p><s>In addition to higher densities of D. citri on border trees, the detailed field study indicated that field colonization starts from the edge and progresses to the interior of the grove (Figs 4 and 5, S3 Appendix).</s><s>Higher rate of D. citri population accumulation was also observed on those border trees than adjacent and interior trees in the grove throughout the active growing season, before a subsequent decline was recorded after the last flush cycle of the year (S4 Appendix).</s><s>Such accumulation of D. citri on edge trees can be a result of inter-generational population growth during new flush cycles, the result of migration processes, or differential psyllid performance on border and interior trees.</s><s>Due to the differential response of arthropod to edges <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref>, it may also be possible that D. citri natural enemies are more abundant in the interior of the groves, thus leading to higher psyllid mortality on trees inside the grove relative to perimeter ones.</s><s>However, there was a density dependent relationship between inner tree colonization and densities on border trees (Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> and <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>).</s><s>In addition to differential colonization preference of trees, studies may be warranted to evaluate the effects of tree nutritional quality, microclimate, or natural enemies on D. citri densities at different spatial niche in the grove.</s></p><p><s>The strong edge effects in D. citri spatial niche occupation in citrus groves demonstrated in the present study have important management implications for this pest.</s><s>Because grove colonization starts from the grove edge where higher densities occurred throughout the year, sampling to determine D. citri presence and densities should only concentrate on grove edges without the need of sampling the whole grove.</s><s>Such sampling protocol will be cost effective and increase the chance of psyllid detection.</s><s>However because of higher D. citri densities on border trees, those edge densities may not be representative of actual densities across the entire grove and such a sampling scheme will lead to an overestimation of actual psyllid population in the grove.</s><s>But such overestimation is beneficial for management purposes as it will lead to timely application of pesticides by growers.</s></p><p><s>Another potential benefit for the edge effect in D. citri grove colonization and spatial distribution is that citrus grove edges can be used as ecological traps on which control tactics can focus more than inner trees.</s><s>Because adult psyllids are detected first on the grove edges (Figs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>), early targeted pesticide application on edge trees at the onset of grove infestation would substantially reduce D. citri population densities and prevent its spread and establishment to inner trees.</s><s>Such targeted and timely border sprays would reduce the risk of HLB while minimizing pesticide input in the grove.</s><s>The width of the edge treatment may depend on the depth of the edge effect or the ecotone.</s><s>In the detailed field study where groves were almost devoid of psyllid for three months, initial infestation was found on the first two trees (perimeter and adjacent) of the groves for one month before any detection inside the grove (Figs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>).</s><s>Such observation suggests that an edge management width encompassing an ecotone of two trees around the grove (i.e.</s><s>first two rows on each side of the grove and first two trees on each rowend) will significantly slow D. citri spread and population increase within the interior of the grove.</s><s>To be effective, edge treatment needs to be implemented following whole grove sprays and using D. citri detection surveys.</s><s>Future studies evaluating the effectiveness of edge treatment for psyllid control in commercial citrus grove would be necessary to make informed management decisions based on D. citri spatial distribution patterns.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc><div><p><s>Surveys
