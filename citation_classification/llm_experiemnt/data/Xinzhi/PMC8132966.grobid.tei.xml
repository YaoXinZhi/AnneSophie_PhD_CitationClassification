<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Viral Infection Affects the Feeding Behavior of R. dorsalis</head><p><s>Different feeding activities during insect probing produced distinct EPG waveforms.</s><s>Characterization of the waveforms produced by R. dorsalis feeding revealed three main types of feeding behaviors: non-ingestion probes, short-ingestion probes, and long-ingestion probes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>).</s><s>The waveform NP indicates that R. dorsalis stays on the leaf surface without probing or feeding; waveform A demonstrates that the stylet begins to probe between the mesophyll cells in a short duration time; waveform S indicates that the saliva is continuously secreted as the stylet penetrates the epidermal tissue to the phloem; waveform C indicates that the active ingestion before the stylet reaches the phloem; waveform E indicates the passive prolonged ingestion in the phloem; waveform F indicates the obstacle signal induced by the obstruction of mechanical puncture with the stylet in the extracellular or intracellular cell wall, such as mesophyll cells and tubular cells, called sieve tubes; waveform R indicates the insertion of the stylet into the leaf tissue.</s></p><p><s>Pairwise comparisons of the feeding behavior of viruliferous or nonviruliferous R. dorsalis on rice plants revealed that the frequency and mean duration of non-ingestion (waveform A) and active ingestion (waveform C) probes were greater for the viruliferous group than for the nonviruliferous group (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>,<ref type="figure">C</ref>).</s><s>Contrarily, the mean duration of individual passive ingestion probes (waveform E) was significantly shorter for the viruliferous group than the nonviruliferous group (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3D</ref>).</s><s>As they fed, viruliferous insects encountered stronger physical barriers, including phloem plugging, than nonviruliferous insects (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3E</ref>).</s><s>Meanwhile, the mean duration of individual salivary secretion (waveform S) and rest (waveform R) probes was significantly longer for the viruliferous group than for the nonviruliferous group (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3F-I</ref>).</s><s>Thus, viral infection potentially prolongs salivary secretion and ingestion probing to facilitate viral release into plant phloem.</s><s>Also, viruliferous R. dorsalis is protected from continuous ingestion of phloem sap from rice plants.</s><s>These findings demonstrate that viral infection of insect vectors impacts the feeding behavior of R. dorsalis to facilitate viral transmission into the plant phloem.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>Vector-borne phloem-inhabiting viral pathogens cause unprecedented economic losses globally and represent some of the most challenging pests to understand due to their specialized feeding strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Stafford et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Jiang et al., 2019)</ref>.</s><s>Understanding the successful transmission mechanism of phloem-inhabiting viruses by piercing-sucking insects into phloem cells still poses a great challenge to researchers.</s><s>Herein, we use the leafhopper-borne phloeminhabiting RGDV to investigate the above important issue.</s></p><p><s>Effective transmission of insect-borne plant viruses into plant phloem is closely related to the active insect feeding behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Jimenez et al., 2018)</ref>.</s><s>We find that nonviruliferous individuals of R. dorsalis prefer to feed on and are attracted to RGDV-infected rice plants compared to viruliferous individuals.</s><s>Attracting more nonviruliferous insects to feed on infected plants potentially promotes viral acquisition and transmission.</s><s>Of note, RGDV infection is thought to regulate the metabolism of rice secondary substances such as terpenoids, phenols, etc., which consequently may enhance the olfactory attraction to R. dorsalis.</s><s>These findings imply that RGDV could alter plant host preference of insect vectors by changing the plant volatiles to promote viral spread to new hosts.</s><s>More importantly, viruliferous insect feeding may manipulate the host phenotypes directly to promote viral spread to new hosts.</s><s>The piercing-sucking insects use stylets to suck plant phloem sap, and saliva is secreted during insect probing, penetration, and ingestion <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Sharma et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>The infectious virions are injected into the rice phloem via the saliva during R. dorsalis feeding, after which the initial infection is robustly established in the host phloem.</s><s>EPG assay demonstrates that viruliferous insects encounter stronger physical barriers such as phloem plugging than nonviruliferous insects during feeding.</s><s>Viral infection of R. dorsalis potentially prolongs the duration of salivary secretion and ingestion probing.</s><s>Following the EPG assay test, we further demonstrate that viruliferous R. dorsalis feeding induces more feeding sites and total probing number.</s><s>Viruliferous insects spend more time resting or moving about on rice plants.</s><s>Such observations imply that viral infection strongly affects the feeding behavior of R. dorsalis, which promotes the secretion of more infectious virions from the salivary glands into rice phloem.</s><s>In consequence, infectious virions secreted from the salivary glands of insect vectors are successfully transmitted to plant phloem.</s><s>Furthermore, we find that viruliferous R. dorsalis feeding induces the deposition of more calloses on sieve plates of rice phloem than nonviruliferous insects.</s><s>Callose deposition on sieve plates in plants is one of the most crucial defense mechanisms against insects ingesting phloem sap <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Cheng et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Based on our findings, viruliferous R. dorsalis encounters a stronger physical barrier of callose deposition than nonviruliferous insects, which prevents insects from continuously ingesting phloem sap.</s><s>Likewise, in rice plants harboring brown planthopper resistance genes, callose deposition on the sieve plates occludes the sieve tubes; thus, the continuous feeding by planthoppers is directly impeded <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Du et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>Of note, viruliferous R. dorsalis would probe more frequently and secrete more saliva on rice plants, promoting viral transmission.</s><s>In response, the feeding by viruliferous R. dorsalis induces the expression of high level of callose synthase gene OsGSL1 and low level of callose hydrolase gene Gns5, which potentially promotes callose deposition in rice phloem cells.</s><s>When the rice plants were infested for 24 h, the induction of callose hydrolase expression by nonviruliferous R. dorsalis is much higher than callose synthase activation by viruliferous R. dorsalis.</s><s>This might indicate suppression of plant anti-defense reactions by nonviruliferous R. dorsalis, but not by viruliferous R. dorsalis.</s><s>Ultimately, viruliferous R. dorsalis would probe more frequently and secrete more saliva on rice plants to promote viral transmission.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Cheng et al. (2013)</ref> found that Ca 2+ accumulation in sieve cells regulated sieve plate occlusion through callose sealing.</s><s>In the present experiment, viruliferous R. dorsalis feeding significantly elevates cytosolic Ca 2+ accumulation in rice and potentially induces strong callose deposition.</s><s>Interestingly, aphids secrete CBP in watery saliva to prevent sieve cell occlusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Will et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Atamian et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Wang et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Similarly, in the saliva of brown planthopper, CBP is secreted into rice cells to decrease rice cytosolic Ca 2+ accumulation in rice cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Ye et al., 2017)</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, we deduce that the secretion of CBP from salivary gland of viruliferous R. dorsalis is decreased, and thus the cytosolic Ca 2+ accumulation level is increased to promote sieve cell occlusion.</s><s>In conclusion, for the first time, the present study demonstrates that the delivery of a phloem-limited virus into the plant phloem by piercing-sucking insects activates the defense-associated callose deposition to enhance viral transmission.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIGURE 1 |</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>FIGURE 1 | Nonviruliferous Recilia dorsalis preferred to feed on infected rice plants.</s><s>Selective preference of nonviruliferous (A) or viruliferous (B) R. dorsalis adults to rice gall dwarf virus (RGDV) infected or healthy rice plants.</s><s>The histogram bars show the number of insects feeding on healthy or RGDV-infected rice plants.</s><s>HP, healthy plant; IP, infected plant.</s><s>Significant differences in gene expression are denoted as * ( p, 0.05) or ** ( p, 0.01); multiple t-tests.</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="4,53.97,500.14,487.58,165.62" type="bitmap" /></figure>
