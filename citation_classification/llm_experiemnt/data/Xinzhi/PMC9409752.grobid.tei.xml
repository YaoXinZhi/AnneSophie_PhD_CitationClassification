meanwhile, the intracellular TIR domain responds to downstream signaling.</s><s>Based on this structural composition, LRRs link extracellular signals to intracellular specific gene expressions <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>.</s><s>To date, these family members have been studied at the genome-wide level in several animals.</s><s>For example, 10 TLRs have been identified in humans, named TLR1-10, while 12 TLRs have been identified in mice, named TLR1-12 <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>; among them, TLR1,2 and TLR4,6 are positioned in the plasma membrane and the function they perform is the recognition of extracellular pathogens <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>.</s><s>The TLR2 receptor recognizes Propionibacterium acnes to induce inflammatory cytokines <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>The TLR5 receptor recognizes and binds to the flagellin protein of some Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and triggers the downstream innate immune response <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>TLR3,7,8 locate within endosomes, recognize viral DNA or RNA that has invaded the cytoplasm, and activate the antiviral immune response <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>TLR roles in antimicrobial immune responses have also been reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s>Six TLRs have been identified in Musca domestica (Diptera: Muscidae) named TLR1-6, and they play crucial roles in the immunity of the housefly <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>Several studies have also been carried out in crustaceous species <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>However, TLR studies at the genome-wide level are currently lacking in the insect lineage.</s></p><p><s>Diaphorina citri is a major emerging pest of citrus production worldwide, because it is a vector for Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus, the causal agent of Huanglongbing, also known as citrus greening, the most damaging disease in citriculture <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>.</s><s>TLRs are very important elements of innate immunity.</s><s>However, the TLRs and their underlying functional mechanisms in D. citri have not been exhaustively addressed to date.</s><s>Using genome-wide analysis, we can gain a systematic understanding of a particular gene family, including member classification, phylogenetics, gene expression, and molecular evolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>In the present study, we aimed to (i) characterize TLR genes in D. citri through genome-wide identification; and (ii) test the hypothesis that C. sinensis seedlings endophytically colonized by B. bassiana lead to changes in TLR gene expression in D. citri when feeding on them.</s><s>Two TLRs were identified in the D. citri genome, and their phylogenetic relationship with other TLRs from different species were analyzed.</s><s>Furthermore, the expression profiles of TLR family members in D. citri fed on endophytically colonized C. sinensis seedlings were studied and the expression analyzed in nymphs and adults.</s><s>Besides, structural alignments showed that the 3-dimensional structures of TIR domains were highly conserved among the two TLRs identified.</s><s>Moreover, the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis of D. citri TLRs suggested some potential interactors in innate immune signaling.</s><s>This study analyzed the outcomes of interaction between D. citri-endophyte-C.</s><s>sinensis in relation to the immune responses and provides a genomic foundation for a better understanding of the effects of entomopathogens in D. citri innate immunity.</s></p></div>

however, in this study the expression was induced as result of insects feeding on endophytically colonized plants.</s><s>It has been discovered that the downregulations or mutations of some extracellular receptors in insects, for example, GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), nACh (nicotinic acetylcholine receptor) receptor, APN (aminopeptidase N) and Cadherin, confer the resistance to synthetic insecticides <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47]</ref>.</s><s>Similarly, the activation of the TLRs leads not only to the responses and signaling but also binds extracellular chemicals or toxins <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>.</s><s>Recently, it has been established that the arthropod Toll pathway plays a significant antibacterial function by monitoring the expression of immune-related genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>According to <ref type="bibr">Gao,</ref><ref type="bibr">et al. [51]</ref> the TIR domain interacts with the myd88 adapter and mediates downstream immune signaling.</s><s>Similarly, the PPI results elucidated that TLR genes interacted with immune-related mediating factors including interleukin-related genes, e.g., myd88 dependent pathway, which could bind the TIR domain.</s><s>According to Sugiyama et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>, myd88 activates NF-kB via Toll-like receptor signaling.</s><s>The myd88 plays important role in immunity using its TIR domain networking with TLR and its Nterminal death domain networking with interleukin-1 receptor-associate kinase to trigger downstream signaling cascades and eliminate the invader <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>.</s><s>Similarly, according to Takeda, Kaisho and Akira <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> the TLRs-induced inflammatory response is dependent on a common signaling pathway and is mediated by the adaptor molecule myd88; however, there is evidence for additional pathways that mediate TLR ligand-specific biological responses.</s><s>Additionally, the structural alignments of different TIR domains from the different species selected demonstrated that they were highly conserved and had similar structural components and spatial arrangements.</s><s>Similar structural components from different species have been reported by Zhao, Wang, Li and Gai <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>This structural preservation of the TIR domain further ensures the functional and structural preservation of TLRs.</s></p><p><s>In summary, comprehensive analyses were performed and identified 2 DcTLR genes in the D. citri genome.</s><s>The two identified DcTLR genes were subjected to analysis of physicochemical features, phylogenetic classification, domain organization, structural alignments, chromosomal localization, protein-protein interaction and expression.</s><s>Results from the expression analysis revealed that B. bassiana endophytically established as an endophyte in C. sinensis seedlings significantly upregulates DcTLR gene expression, activating the immune system of D. citri.</s><s>Our present work provides systematic information and a comprehensive overview of the functional mechanisms and expression of D. citri TLRs in response to endophytes; additionally, the results provide a theorical foundation for further studies on the molecular mechanisms of TLRs in D. citri.</s></p></div>
