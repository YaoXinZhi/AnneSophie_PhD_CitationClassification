(Oleaceae) <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref>, in the scent of Podisus and Supputius species (Heteroptera, Pentatomidae) <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> and the predatory bug Geocoris punctipes (Say) (Hemiptera, Lygaeidae) <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> and it can act as a pheromone, an attractant or an allomone depending on the insect species.</s><s>The compound 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-ol (sulcatol) was found in the floral scent of many plant species, in the blend of volatiles emitted by wheat seedlings heavily infested by bird cherry-oat aphid, Rhopalosiphum padi (L.) (Homoptera, Aphididae), and it is also synthetized in the hindgut of males of the ambrosia beetle Megaplatypus mutatus (Chapuis) (Coleoptera, Platypodidae) which release it to attract females <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>.</s><s>This compound, in a naturally occurring mixture with 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one and 2-tridecanone, mediates spacing behavior of R. padi feeding on cereals <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> and is the aggregation pheromone of several ambrosia beetles <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, this study provides evidence on the functionality of antennal sensilla previously described as putative olfactory sensilla in P. spumarius adults.</s><s>Moreover, it demonstrates the capability of the male and female olfactory systems to selectively perceive a variety of VOCs with a possible infochemical role that, alone or in combination with visual and vibrational stimuli, may modulate P. spumarius intra-and interspecific interactions.</s><s>This first contribution to the knowledge of the sensitivity profile of P. spumarius to a variety of VOCs provides a basis for future chemical, electrophysiological and behavioral investigations aimed at identifying biologically-active compounds useful for the implementation of semiochemicalbased control strategies for this pest.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig 1.
