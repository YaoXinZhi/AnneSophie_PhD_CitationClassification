cascading events <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>Individuals must search for mates, engage in courtship, copulate and might need to recover from the cumulative costs of prior events.</s><s>Searching and courtship involve communication and coordination between individuals that may not necessarily share similar intentions <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>Sexual conflict arises because males and females have divergent interests linked to gender-based differences in size and the mobility of gametes, i.e., anisogamy <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Generally, males can afford to produce relatively larger numbers of gametes compared to females, whose gametes are usually larger and more costly to produce <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>Consequently, males optimise their reproductive fitness by maximising the number of mating events, whereas females optimise fitness by selecting and mating with higher quality males, i.e., females are choosy <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>Female choosiness is widely reported in several insect orders <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>In some species, males may invest significantly in reproduction, leading to an apparent reversal of sex roles <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>In such systems, female fitness is often an increasing function of the number of matings, especially when females receive direct benefits (e.g., nuptial gifts, access to food resources defended by males) from males during copulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>For example, virgin and mated female Pieris protodice (Lepidoptera: Pieridae) solicit copulations to obtain fresh spermatophores from males <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Mating systems, such as polygyny (males mate with several females), polyandry (females mate with several males) and monoandry (an exclusive association with a single member of the opposite sex) have been reported in several insect orders, such as Orthoptera, Diptera and Hemiptera <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>Similarly, male mating strategies, including female defence (males defend one or more females), i.e., male dominance and competition for choosy mates, resource defence (males defend resources critical to female survival) and self-advertising or leks (males position themselves around locations frequented by females) are widely reported among various insect orders <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>Mating systems and male mating strategies determine sex roles (which sex searches and which sex signals), the efficacy of mate finding and the frequency of courtship <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Insects rely on a wide range of signalling modalities to communicate <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>Orders, such as Lepidoptera and Hymenoptera, rely heavily on chemical and visual signals <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>Orthoptera and some families of Hemiptera, most notably Cicadidae, primarily rely on airborne acoustic signals (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>).</s><s>Other hemipteran families (e.g., Pentatomidae and Cydnidae) are known to utilize substrate borne vibrations for mate location and assessment <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s>Orders in which chemical signalling is dominant usually possess, not surprisingly, highly developed olfactory systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, while those that rely on vibrational signals tend to possess well developed sound producing and perception organs <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>.</s><s>The relative degree of complexity of morphological traits associated with signalling usually reflects the relative importance of a signal modality within a species <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>.</s><s>The diversity of signals utilised reflects phylogenetic traits retained over evolutionary time, often as a consequence of physical constraints imposed by their environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Long-range signals are required to convey species and gender-specific information during searching, while short-range signals convey information about a specific individual, which is important during courtship <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>.</s><s>In the case of chemical signalling, highly volatile semiochemicals (those with molecular weights (MWs) &lt;300) are involved in long-range transmission of information, while heavier compounds (such as cuticular hydrocarbons with MWs &gt;300) are considered more effective for short-range communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref>.</s><s>Single-signal modalities may be capable of conveying information during both mate finding and courtship.</s><s>However, distortions (due to contamination or background noise (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>) and, in some cases, deception from senders have driven some species to rely on more than a single signal modality, i.e., multimodal signalling systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</s><s>For example, a multimodal signalling system involving semiochemicals and vibrational signals has been reported in the green vegetable bug, Nezara viridula (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, mating and courtship signals are often under strong stabilising selection pressure to maintain species-specific information <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</s><s>Consequently, species and mate recognition signals are expected to show little intraspecific variation, thus limiting the information available for mate assessment.</s><s>Species, such as N. viridula, address this dilemma by utilizing a multimodal signalling system or, in cases where a single modality is utilized (e.g., vibrational signals), by varying mate finding and courtship signals <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>.</s><s>Variation in mate finding and courtship signal characteristics has also been reported in field crickets and cicadas <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>.</s></p></div>

Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>Here, we use the term mate finding synonymously with searching to refer to all activities leading to mate location and contact between males and females.</s><s>Courtship is used to refer to close-range activities between males and females from initial contact to copulation.</s><s>Generally, mate finding involves random movements by males followed by directed searching once they have perceived a female signal.</s><s>In contrast, females are sedentary and, in most cases, only signal in response to male signals if receptive to mating

brief <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">70]</ref> and, in most cases, lacks extravagant behaviours associated with courtship in other insect taxa, e.g., dances, exchange of nuptial gifts and serenades <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref>.</s><s>The small size of most psyllid species (~2-8 mm) complicates studies of courtship and partly explains why these behaviours are poorly understood.</s><s>Nevertheless, rapid wing vibration and tarsal oscillation, such as

the use of vibrational signalling during courtship (note: the functional significance of tarsal oscillations to the production of substrate-borne vibrations has not been demonstrated).</s><s>Antennation of the bodies of individual B. cockerelli and C. pyricola prior to copulation could suggest a role of cuticular hydrocarbons in mate assessment during courtship <ref

searching for females, but not physical combat <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68]</ref>.</s><s>As mentioned, females

target="#b66">[67,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68]</ref>.</s><s>In some species, such as A. dobsoni, B. cockerelli and C. pyricola, males often attempt to mate with other males or with mating pairs without any obvious aggressive behaviour.</s><s>These behavioural characteristics suggest that psyllid males maximise their fitness via competition for choosy mates, i.e., scramble competition (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>).</s><s>Males are apparently the -search and signal‖ sex and females are the -sedentary and signal‖ sex.</s><s>Most vibrational studies have found that

males <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">78]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, females may attract males using long-range signals (i.e., volatile semiochemicals or vibrational signals), and males may then be assessed by females using short-range signals (cuticular hydrocarbons or vibrational signals) (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>Short range, sex-specific signals that are used for mate assessment are therefore expected to vary more in males compared to females.</s><s>(Note: We propose that for psyllid semiochemical signals, long range should refer to distances greater than the length of a host plant module (e.g., photosynthetic branchlet or leaf), since these signals should be able to attract conspecific insects from neighbouring plants.</s><s>For vibrational signals, long range should refer to distances greater than the length of a plant module, but limited to the same host, since these signals cannot transmit across open spaces.</s><s>In contrast, short range for both semiochemical and vibrational signals should mean less than one body length of a conspecific insect.</s></p><p><s>Mating systems are unlikely to be similar across Psylloidea and male behaviours, such as attempting to mate with other males and with in copula pairs, suggesting the potential existence of alternative mating strategies,
