(Rhizobiales: Rhizobiaceae), a bacterium presumed to be responsible for a serious citrus disease known as Asiatic huanglongbing (also known as citrus greening or yellow shoot disease; <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Halbert and</ref><ref type="bibr">Manjunath 2004, Bové 2006</ref>).</s><s>Management tactics aimed at preventing the introduction and spread of the disease in citrus orchards have largely been ineffective and once trees are infected, there is no cure for the disease.</s><s>The Asian citrus psyllid is thought to be southwest Asia in origin and the disease was first described in Asia, but both the vector and bacterium have invaded many citrus-growing areas around the world.</s><s>Following the 1998 discovery of the psyllid in the United States (Florida) and the subsequent 2005 discovery of huanglongbing, the sweet orange and grapefruit industries in Florida have seriously been jeopardized <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Hodges and</ref><ref type="bibr">Spreen 2012, Alvarez et al. 2016)</ref>.</s><s>Researchers and growers continue struggling to find solutions.</s></p><p><s>Many research endeavors seeking solutions to huanglongbing are dependent on colonies of Asian citrus psyllid reared in laboratory or greenhouse settings.</s><s>The USDA in Fort Pierce, Florida many years ago established insectary colonies of the psyllid in an air-conditioned, polycarbonate (GE 8mm Twin Wall, Lexan Thermoclear, San Diego Plastics, Inc., National City, CA) greenhouse.</s><s>Cages of Asian citrus psyllid on potted host plants are maintained on wire shelving under natural sunlight.</s><s>Initially there was a single shelf of cages around the greenhouse, but later a second shelf was added below the first shelf.</s><s>Eventually thousands of psyllids were needed weekly; thus, rearing was expanded to a three-shelf arrangement accommodating dozens of rearing cages.</s><s>General observations revealed that numbers of psyllids produced per cage were largest on the top shelf and lowest on the bottom shelf.</s><s>This was perceived primarily as a lighting issue, a consequence of differences in irradiance (solar radiation) or illuminance (light intensity) or both.</s><s>The initial remedy was to allow oviposition and early development of nymphs to take place in cages on the top shelf, moving cages to the middle and ultimately the lowest shelf as nymphs progressed through the third to fifth instars.</s><s>Later, cages on the middle and bottom shelves were provided supplemental lighting (light-emitting diode [LED] floodlights outside of a cage aimed at the plants inside).</s><s>Cages on the top shelf were not provided supplemental lighting.</s><s>The changes in lighting increased psyllid production on the lower shelves.</s><s>Eventually the questions arose as to how much supplemental lighting was needed and whether supplemental lighting would enhance production on the upper shelf, particularly during cloudy periods of time and under shorter photoperiods in winter.</s></p><p><s>The primary objectives of research presented here were to assess the influence of irradiance and illuminance on Asian citrus psyllid production parameters, specifically 1) oviposition rates, 2) numbers of adults produced, and 3) developmental rates from oviposition to emergence of new adults.</s><s>In addition, of interest were biological parameters associated with adult psyllids produced under different light regimes including sex ratios, abdominal color of newly emerged adults, and the occurrence of adults with wing deformities, the latter of which are sometimes observed <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Hall and Hentz 2016)</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods and Materials</head><p><s>The influence of irradiance and illuminance on reproductive rates of Asian citrus psyllids in rearing cages was assessed by subjecting different rearing cages to different amounts of light.</s><s>The experiment was repeated 5 times in the following order, with natural light and different amounts of supplemental lighting each time: late fall, winter, spring, mid-summer, and late summer.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research Setting</head><p><s>Adults of the Asian citrus psyllid for these studies were obtained from the aforementioned USDA insectary colony, established in 2000 using psyllids field-collected from citrus and subsequently reared in cages (BugDorm-2, BD2120F; MegaView Science Education Services Co., Ltd., Taichung, Taiwan) in the air-conditioned greenhouse (roof and upper walls made of the polycarbonate panels described above).</s><s>Details of the colony have previously been reviewed <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Hall et al. 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Citrus macrophylla Wester has been used as the rearing plant since 2010.</s><s>The insectary colony is maintained using procedures similar to those described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Skelley and Hoy (2004)</ref>, with no infusion of wild types.</s><s>The insectary colony is subdivided among many cages (up to 78 at a time) containing psyllids at various different stages of growth and age.</s></p><p><s>The greenhouse air conditioner maintains an average annual air temperature of about 25°C, measured in the center of the greenhouse 2.5 m above the floor.</s><s>However, during winter and summer, the temperature has averaged around 22 and 27°C, respectively.</s><s>The greenhouse is fitted with an automatic ceiling shade cloth programed to provide shade from the hours of 1300 to 1700 each day (civil time during two winter repetitions and daylight savings time for the other three repetitions).</s><s>The shade cloth is important for reducing excessively high temperatures during the afternoon.</s><s>With shade in place, maximum daily temperatures at the center of the greenhouse during summer afternoons are usually maintained below 32°C, but temperatures before 1300 h are sometimes higher.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Rearing Procedures and Production Data</head><p><s>Except where noted, the research presented here followed the same rearing procedures routinely used to maintain the USDA insectary colony.</s><s>Citrus macrophylla plants for insectary cages are grown in 3.8-liter pots (model C300S, Universal Enterprises Supply Corp., Pompano Beach, FL) containing steamed (sterilized) Pro-Mix BX (Premier Horticulture, Inc., Quakertown, PA) and are trimmed to stimulate a flush of new leaf growth when the plants are 20 to 25 cm tall.</s><s>Stems of new leaf growth are commonly referred to as flush shoots <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Hall and Albrigo 2007)</ref> and are essential for oviposition and nymph development.</s><s>When new flush begins to emerge, a new insectary colony cage is established using four plants per cage (two on the north and two on the south side of a cage), each plant usually with 10 to 15 new flush shoots.</s><s>For the study presented here, each plant was standardized to have 11 or 12 new flush shoots per plant.</s><s>Approximately 300 adult psyllids (10 to 14 d old, no attention to sex) are introduced and allowed to oviposit for 3 d.</s><s>For the study presented here, 300 adults were allowed to oviposit for 24 h.</s><s>The adults are then removed from the plants by shaking each plant vigorously in the cage to dislodge the adults, removing the plants from the cage and aspirating from each plant any remaining adults.</s><s>The four plants with fresh eggs are transferred to a clean cage, which is then placed onto a rearing shelf.</s><s>Eggs are allowed to hatch and nymphs develop to the adult stage.</s><s>The potted plants are maintained in drip pans, to which tap water is added twice a week.</s><s>A general purpose 20N-10P-20K water-soluble fertilizer mix (Peters Professional, The Scotts Company, Marysville, OH) is applied once a week when watering.</s></p><p><s>Oviposition dates for the five repetitions of the experiment: for late fall, 15-16 November; for winter, 17-18 January; for spring, 12-13 April; for mid-summer, 16-17 July; and for late summer, 31 August-1 September.</s><s>After 24 h of oviposition, four typical flush shoots (one from each cardinal section of each plant) were removed from each plant and examined under a dissecting microscope to count the number of eggs per shoot.</s><s>The specific plant from which shoots were taken was recorded in all but the first repetition.</s><s>For the first four repetitions, the cages were monitored until new adults first began emerging, at which point new adults were removed from cages daily, which allowed calculation of initial and peak emergence periods.</s><s>We ceased monitoring a set of cages for new adults when none was found in some cages, few were found in other cages, and there appeared to be an absence of mature nymphs remaining on the plants.</s><s>Data collected included the number of adults emerging each day, their sex, the color of their abdomen (gray/brown, blue/green, or yellow/orange as described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Wenninger et al. 2009)</ref>, and the number with wing deformities.</s><s>For the late summer repetition, the cages were monitored during weekdays, new adults were removed daily on weekdays until emergence was over, and the total number of adults produced was determined.</s><s>Since the cages were not observed on weekends, we were unsure when emergence began in two of the cages of this repetition, and peak emergence could not be identified in any of the cages.</s><s>No data were collected on color morphs or wing deformities during the late summer repetition.</s><s>For all repetitions of the experiment, the total number of adults collected from a cage was divided by the number of flush shoots in the cage (excluding the four removed for egg counts) to estimate the number of adults produced per flush shoot.</s><s>An index of immature survival to the adult stage was taken as the mean number of adults produced per shoot in a cage divided by the mean number of eggs per flush shoot in the cage-an index value of 1.0 indicated that all eggs made it to the adult stage, with decreasing values indicating increasingly poorer survival.</s></p></div>
