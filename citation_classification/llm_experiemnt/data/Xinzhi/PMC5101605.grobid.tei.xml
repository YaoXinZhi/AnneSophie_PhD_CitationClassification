<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>The Asian citrus psyllid (ACP), Diaphorina citri Kuwayama, is one of the most serious citrus pests worldwide due to its role as vector of huanglongbing or citrus greening disease.</s><s>While some optimal plant species for ACP oviposition and development have been identified, little is known of the influence of host plants on ACP size and shape.</s><s>Our goal was to determine how size and shape of ACP wing and body size varies when development occurs on different host plants in a controlled rearing environment.</s><s>ACP were reared on six different rutaceous species; Bergera koenigii, Citrus aurantifolia, Citrus macrophylla, Citrus maxima, Citrus taiwanica and Murraya paniculata.</s><s>Adults were examined for morphometric variation using traditional and geometric analysis based on 12 traits or landmarks.</s><s>ACP reared on C. taiwanica were consistently smaller than those reared on the other plant species.</s><s>Wing aspect ratio also differed between C. maxima and C. taiwanica.</s><s>Significant differences in shape were detected with those reared on M. paniculata having narrower wings than those reared on C. macrophylla.</s><s>This study provides evidence of wing size and shape differences of ACP based on host plant species which potentially may impact dispersal.</s><s>Further study is needed to determine if behavioral and physiological differences are associated with the observed phenotypic differences.</s></p></div>
