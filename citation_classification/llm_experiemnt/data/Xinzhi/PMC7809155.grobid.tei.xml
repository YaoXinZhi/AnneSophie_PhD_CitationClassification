<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Since it was first discovered in Taiwan in 1907 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> , the Asian citrus psyllid (ACP) Diaphorina citri (Hemiptera: Liviidae) has become the most significant vector of Candidatus Liberibacter spp.</s><s>(Huanglongbing [HLB] or citrus greening disease) in citrus orchards.</s><s>HLB is the most serious disease threatening the citrus industry 2 .</s><s>To date, HLB has spread to over 40 countries in Asia, Oceania and both North and South America <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> .</s><s>After Witlaczil's pioneering work at the end of the nineteenth century <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> a number of studies have described various aspects of the anatomy of different psyllid species  . The </s><s>ajority of these descriptions and illustrations are based on microscopy techniques that require insect dissection to enhance visibility of internal structures and organs.</s><s>While dissection techniques are very useful, they have limitations because they distort the spatial arrangement of internal structures.</s><s>A relatively recent technique, known as micro-computed tomography (micro-CT), which is based on X-rays, allows visualization of the internal anatomy in situ, without the need to dissect the insect; results have been validated by comparing them with classical destructive methodologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59</ref> .</s><s>Thus, micro-CT has now been used to elucidate insect anatomy;

a pair of lateral longitudinal tracheal trunks (located in the dorsal abdominal third), each with a double tube branching anteriorly and entering into the thorax; and The dorsal vessel (heart).</s><s>This is located in a dorsal-medial abdominal position, and situated immediately below the 4th-7th abdominal tergites (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">10a</ref>).</s><s>It has four dilated heart chambers each opened by a pair of lateral ostia (Figs.</s><s>9a, 10c and Supplementary Video S2).</s><s>The dorsal vessel is extended forwards into an aorta located in an anterior position, starting at the third abdominal segment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">10b</ref>,<ref type="figure">c</ref>).</s><s>Lateral to each heart chamber are fascicles of alary muscles, (delta-wing-shaped, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">10b</ref>).</s><s>The digestive system and associated structures.</s><s>The ACP has a rather complex piercing and pumping feeding apparatus (labium, mandibular/maxillary stylets and a cibarial pump).</s><s>The digestive system sensu stricto (Figs.</s><s>11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and Supplementary Videos S5-S9) opens to a pharynx running anteriorly inside the cibarium (clypeus) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">15f-h</ref>); the pharynx crosses the ventral nerve cord between the brain and the subesophageal ganglion and it has a precibarial-pump (the salivary pump) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">17c-d</ref> and Supplementary Video S4) and also a cibarial pump (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">15c</ref>,<ref type="figure">h</ref>) with an internal flapping diaphragmatic cibarial valve (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">15d</ref>).</s><s>The cibarial pump is connected to four pairs of cibarial dilator muscles.</s><s>Dorsally, each pair of cibarial dilator     muscles join medially and appear v-shaped; the first pair of muscles are clearly the largest, decreasing in size from the 1st to the 4th (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">15g</ref> and Supplementary Video S7).</s><s>The esophagus.</s><s>The pharynx continues into the esophagus which, after a large loop, turn backwards, passing on and close to the ventral nerve cord (Figs.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">11a</ref>,<ref type="figure">c</ref>, 12b and Supplementary Video S5), and then dilates slightly before connecting with the filter chamber (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">15d</ref>,e and Supplementary Videos S5, S10).</s></p><p><s>The midgut.</s><s>The esophagus connects with a dilated afferent midgut (crop), runs backwards to the right and immediately down to form the medial descending midgut arm.</s><s>After a ventral midgut loop the ascending midgut arm goes left and dorsally, and, after a fore dorsal midgut loop, a right fore midgut dorsal arm runs backwards and down to a right descending dorsal middle arm; from here and after a right midgut middle loop, is the start of the right ascending midgut dorsal middle arm in which the 1st midgut appendage is inserted (located in a right-fore position); after this, the right hind midgut dorsal arm continues and joins the 2nd midgut appendage (located in a right-hind position); after this, the left hind midgut dorsal arm continues forwards (the 3rd midgut appendage connects to it and is located in a left-hind position immediately after the connection of the 2nd midgut appendage), and immediately turns down, forming a short left descending midgut dorsal arm which, after a   left midgut middle loop, turns upwards forming a short left ascending midgut dorsal middle arm, and then the afferent midgut; the midgut connects to the filter chamber in a posterior dorsal position.</s><s>The walls of the midgut have very conspicuous rhomboid cells (Fig. 13a and Supplementary Video S8).</s><s>The appendages of the midgut.</s><s>The four appendages show a parallel symmetrical arrangement in pairs, with the 1st and 4th directed forward and the 2nd and 3rd directed backwards (Figs.</s><s>11, 12, 13a-c and Supplementary videos S5, S6, S8).</s><s>They show a tubular structure; the walls are formed from a single layer of cells delimiting an internal lumen (Figs.</s><s>11d,e, 13, and Supplementary Videos S5, S6, S8).</s></p><p><s>The inner hindgut.</s><s>After the midgut, a narrower inner hindgut continues inside the filter chamber; it turns one way and forms a U-turn on the right side, makes two complete turns and exits the filter chamber on the front left side, just behind the esophagus insertion.</s><s>The inner hindgut progressively increases in diameter; by the last turn it has doubled in diameter, but then thins out as it leaves the filter chamber to form the outer hindgut (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">14</ref> and Supplementary Video S9).</s></p><p><s>The filter chamber.</s><s>This is located in the anterior third of the abdomen, in a dorsal-central position and partially extending into the 3rd abdominal segment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">12</ref> and Supplementary Video S6).</s><s>It is inclined at an angle of circa 45º with the anterior part (where the esophagus joins) at the same level as where the thorax separates from the abdomen, and lower than the posterior part (Figs.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">11</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">12</ref>, Supplementary Videos S5 and S6).</s><s>Within the chamber there are three separate regions, or spaces, enclosed in a sheath and surrounded by the inner hindgut.</s><s>The three regions can be distinguished from each other: the anterior region is spongy, pyriform (1, bulb) and more voluminous than the others; then there is an intermediate region (2) and a posterior region (3) that are of progressively smaller volumes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">14c</ref>,<ref type="figure">d</ref> and Supplementary Video S9).</s></p><p><s>The outer hindgut.</s><s>The outer hindgut begins at the upper left side of the filter chamber very close behind the point where the esophagus joins (Figs.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">13b</ref>,<ref type="figure">d</ref>,<ref type="figure">e</ref>, 14a,b,g,h and Supplementary Video S9).</s><s>It runs above the nerve cord along the length of the abdomen ultimately connecting with the anus (Figs.</s><s>11a, 12a and Supplementary Videos S4, S5).</s><s>The hindgut is posteriorly differentiated into a rectum that, in males, is configured as a long, flared tube;
