<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Zelus renardii is one of the alien insects recently acclimatised to the Mediterranean basin.</s><s>The trivial name "leafhopper assassin bug" preludes the reduviid prey preference.</s><s>In the Mediterranean, Zelus renardii adapted to preying on vicarious indigenous species, including Philaenus spumarius (Hemiptera: Aphrophoridae), the European vector of Xylella fastidiosa.</s><s>Reduviidae has several thoracic glands, pair or unpair, whose secretions may regulate adult insect behaviours, such as defence, alarm, and mating.</s><s>Zelus renardii also possesses a pair of Brindley's glands, each consisting of about one hundred elements secerning in a reservoir with an outlet that opens at the thoracoabdominal limit.</s><s>Stressful events elicit the production and secretion of a semiochemical bouquet, acting as alarm pheromones.</s><s>This bouquet comprises 2-methyl-propanoic acid, 2-methyl-butanoic acid and 3-methyl-1-butanol as significant components, effectively repel conspecifics and suggest the role of Brindley's glands as alarm pheromone foci.</s><s>Zelus renardii reduces the production of alarm pheromones and the chance of being detected by prey interacting with P. spumarius.</s><s>Alternatively, the alarm pheromone could help the predator to mark its territory, avoiding interaction with a conspecific.</s><s>Evidence of the ability of Philaenus spumarius to perceive and react to the predator's semiochemical would provide a further means to manage transmission and infection by Xylella fastidiosa.</s></p></div>

target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>These species must overcome biotic and abiotic stresses to survive, colonise, and reproduce <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>In this scenario, native species meet allochthonous ones, generating new interactions.</s><s>These interactions can lead to mutualistic interplays (positive interactions) or biological invasions (negative interactions) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>Negative interactions can turn alien species into invasives, leading to infestations of plant pests or pathogen epidemics.</s></p><p><s>The quarantine bacterium Xylella fastidiosa Wells et al., 1987 (XF) subsp.</s><s>Pauca ST53 [4,5] entered from Costa Rica to Italy (Apulia), developing the consequent epidemic on olive trees, showing how an alien species can invade new hitherto-unexplored territories.</s><s>Indeed, XF-infected plants ultimately cease production and die within a few years <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>In Apulia, XF encountered Aphrophoridae xylem-feeders (Spittlebugs, Hemiptera: Auchenorrhyncha), which acquire, transmit, and spread the bacterium in Olea europaea L., 1753 populations, a new host.</s><s>Several Aphrophoridae can acquire and transmit XF.</s><s>However, Philaenus spumarius L., 1758 (PS) is the main vector for population size and infective abilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>The ability to transmit XF has changed PS's status from a marginal insect to a key pest for olive trees in the Mediterranean Basin, leading to increased attention in managing PS infections <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>The currently recommended strategy first suggests minimising PS populations during juvenile stages.</s><s>Management then focuses on surviving adults, to prevent acquisition and transmission, or limiting infection events to one per plant adult to slow or to stop XF invasion.</s><s>The aim is to kill vectors during their first feeding on olive trees, particularly in areas still free from the bacterium <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The basis of the infection management strategy is the integration of several control actions.</s><s>This strategy involves resistant olive tree cultivars, mechanical and chemical control of PS juvenile instars, and chemical and biological control of PS adults <ref

gland system of adults of Zelus ssp.</s><s>(Reduviidae: Harpactorinae) includes only Brindley's glands <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</s><s>At high doses, 2-methyl-propanoic acid elicits alarm responses in adults and juveniles of Triatoma infestans (Klug, 1834) <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63]</ref> and R. prolixus <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>.</s><s>In contrast, this acid in low doses and mixtures with other organic acids in the blends produced by Brindley's glands has attracted the juvenile stages of T. infestans <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>.</s><s>2-Methyl-butanoic acid makes up the volatilome of ZR and has been found to be secreted in Brindley's glands and, together with its derivatives, is part of the alarm pheromone blend of T. infestans <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, the production of these organic acids suggests that they may perform similar functions in ZR bionomics.</s></p><p><s>3-Methyl-1-butanol has never been reported among the compounds released by Reduviidae and can be considered one of the precursors of 2-methyl-butanoic and 2-methyl propanoic acids.</s><s>3-Methyl-1-butanol can be a derivative of isopentenyl pyrophosphate or its isomer dimethylallyl pyrophosphate.</s><s>These isomers are derivatives of mevalonic acid, formed by coupling 3-unit acetyl-coenzyme A <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>.</s><s>The oxidation of 3-methyl-1butanol, commonly known as isoamyl alcohol, gives 3-methyl-butanoic acid <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>.</s><s>2-Methylbutanoic acid can originate from 3-methyl-1-butanol or putative precursors (isopentenyl and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate) by hydrolysis, hydrogenation, and oxidation.</s><s>However, 2-methyl-butanoic acid can also come from the poly-acetate pathway.</s><s>Furthermore, 2-methyl-propanoic acid (or isobutyric acid) can also be formed from 3-methyl-1-butanol by successive transformation into 3-methyl-butanoic acid (primary oxidation) and 3-methyl-2oxobutanoic acid (secondary oxidation), before finally undergoing decarboxylation.</s><s>Thus, 3-methyl-1-butanol may precede the two more abundant organic acids detected in the ZR volatilome in storage in the gland reservoir.</s><s>Possible transformation into 2-methyl-butanoic and 2-methyl propanoic acids occurs by spontaneous oxidation, hydrolysis, hydrogenation, and decarboxylation occurring in the environment.</s></p><p><s>3-Methyl-1-butanol, 2-methyl-propanoic, and 2-methyl-butanoic acids individually stimulated ZR to move away to areas of the olfactometer devoid of olfactory stimuli (controls), suggesting their role as alarm pheromones, as is already known for other reduviid species <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">64]</ref>.</s><s>These three substances could compose the alarm pheromone blend of Z. renardii, with a predominance of 2-methyl-propanoic acid.</s><s>Further studies will include the estimation of Kovats' retention indices for each VOC using authentic standards and could investigate how combinations of these compounds could influence the behaviour of the ZR.</s></p><p><s>The VOCs detected are substances with low molecular weights and high volatility, typical characteristics of compounds that stimulate defensive behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>.</s><s>The characteristics of VOCs allow them to quickly reach the olfactory receptors of conspecifics and to be rapidly eliminated after a disturbance.</s><s>In this way, risk communication and the defensive response of conspecifics are immediate <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The secretion of alarm pheromones induces behavioural changes in the conspecific that detects them <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref>.</s><s>These consist of a series of defensive behaviour strategies, which may include the detection of danger (defence), avoidance of the threat (escape), or deterrence through attack (fight) <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>.</s><s>ZRs run away and show defensive strategies, reacting to all three VOCs tested separately.</s><s>This evidence confirms that 2-methyl-propanoic acid, 2methyl-butanoic acid, and 3-methyl-1-butanol act individually as alarm pheromones in ZR. 3-Methyl-1-butanol elicited the highest escaping behaviour, followed by 2-methyl-butanoic and 2-methyl-propanoic acids.</s></p><p><s>The concentration of volatile organic acids shows a significant standard deviation when the predator is alone, whereas it is more stable during the interaction.</s><s>The minor fluctuations could be due to our experimental systems' separation networks between prey and predator.</s><s>The predation behaviour of Zelus includes ambushing or prey stalking <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref>.</s><s>The presence of stable support during the interaction with PS, which provides the predator with the opportunity to hide by ambushing the prey, could cause the ZR to perceive a reduction in stress, thereby stabilising the production of alarm pheromones.</s></p><p><s>When the predator is alone, it releases significantly higher amounts of 2-methylpropanoic acid and 2-methyl-butanoic acid, reducing their secretion in the presence of prey.</s><s>Predators can modulate the secretion of alarm pheromones, and ZR can reduce the release of alarm pheromones to optimise disguise during the ambush and increase the predation rates.</s><s>Only 3-methyl-1-butanol increases during the interaction and elicits an alarm response in ZR.</s><s>The presence of this compound is connected to the reduction of 2-methyl-propionic acid and 2-methyl-butanoic acid, which could be precursors.</s></p><p><s>Predators use kairomones to locate their prey in natural habitats.</s><s>Kairomones emitted by prey or synomones released by host plants can attract predators or parasitoids <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">73]</ref>.</s><s>Prey can, likewise, develop mechanisms to detect the predator's presence that elicit defensive responses to escape the threat of predation <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>.</s><s>In addition, the alarm pheromones of some species can induce defensive behaviour in other species sharing the same habitat <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref>.</s><s>The same VOCs may mediate different intra-and interspecific responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref>.</s><s>Perception of predators is a crucial adaptation for reducing predation risk and maintaining prey fitness <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Modulating alarm pheromone production may also mark the predation area of ZR, keeping conspecific prey competitors at a distance.</s><s>Some plant pests and predators use territory marking to reduce intraspecific competition for food sources.</s><s>For example, females of more than 20 species of Tephritidae (Diptera) of the genera Ceratitis, Anastrepha, Rhagoletis, and some Bactrocera <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref> mark the host with pheromones at oviposition sites by dragging the surrounding area with the ovipositor <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref>.</s><s>Host-marking pheromones inhibit further and subsequent egg-laying, reducing competition from various larvae for the same food source and cannibalism events in favour of species fitness.</s><s>Moreover, pheromone marking is also known for several predator species belonging to different insect orders <ref type="bibr">[78]</ref>.</s><s>During the search for prey, the larvae of some Coccinellidae and Chrysopidae deposit ovipositiondeterring pheromones (ODPs) to induce conspecific females to not lay eggs near insect colonies or areas already occupied <ref
