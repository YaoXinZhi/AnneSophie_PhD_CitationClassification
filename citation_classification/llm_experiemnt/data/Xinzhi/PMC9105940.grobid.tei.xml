<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Walnut species (Juglans spp.) are multipurpose trees, widely employed in plantation forestry for high-quality timber and nut production, as well as in urban greening as ornamental plants.</s><s>These species are currently threatened by the thousand cankers disease (TCD) complex, an insect-fungus association which involves the ascomycete Geosmithia morbida (GM) and its vector, the bark beetle Pityophthorus juglandis.</s><s>While TCD has been studied extensively where it originated in North America, little research has been carried out in Europe, where it was more recently introduced.</s><s>A key step in research to cope with this new phytosanitary emergency is the development of effective molecular detection tools.</s><s>In this work, we report two accurate molecular methods for the diagnosis of GM, based on LAMP (real-time and visual) and SYBR Green qPCR, which are complimentary to and integrated with similar recently developed assays.</s><s>Our protocols detected GM DNA from pure mycelium and from infected woody tissue with high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, without cross-reactivity to a large panel of taxonomically related species.</s><s>The precision and robustness of our tests guarantee high diagnostic standards and could be used to support field diagnostic end-users in TCD monitoring and surveillance campaigns.</s></p></div>

thus, the development of effective diagnostics for these organisms is urgently needed.</s></p><p><s>Diagnosis of TCD in the field, without the support of a specialized equipment, is challenging and not straightforward.</s><s>Symptoms of GM infection are rather nonspecific and inconspicuous in the early stages of the disease, frequently being confused with abiotic damage, thus hampering diagnosis through visual observation <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>This is quite common in black walnut stands, as J. nigra prefers deep and well-drained neutral soils of fertile alluvial deposits <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>Since this species has been extensively planted in a wide variety of sites of contrasting moisture, temperature, and edaphic conditions, including humid valley floors, dry ridges, and slopes, it frequently suffers from water stagnation, water scarcity, heat stress, drought, or unsuitable soil <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>These environmental stress factors represent important constraints to black walnut cultivation, inducing in stands growing at unsuitable sites a generalized symptomatology in many ways identical to that induced by TCD <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Morphology-based identification of GM can also be troublesome.</s><s>The unavailability of a specific substrate or of antibiotics suitable to suppress the growth of contaminating Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and of mycobacteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> hampers the recovery of the fungus from environmental samples.</s><s>A plethora of fungi are also associated with symptomatic woody tissue (underbark necrotic areas around beetle holes and inside galleries) of walnut in the field, and these contaminants often develop in culture faster than the etiologic agent, overgrowing it and masking its presence.</s><s>GM is in fact slow-growing, taking 3-4 weeks to develop an appreciable colony on an agarized medium, on which it also exhibits considerable phenotypic variation.</s><s>Furthermore, this ascomycete does not form observable sexual reproductive structures (fruiting bodies) in the outer host tissue or inside beetle galleries; its identification relies upon microscopic examination of the sole vegetative mycelium and conidiophores bearing metulae, phialides, and conidia <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s>Mycological laboratory practice and experience must be, therefore, coupled with time and work to grow, isolate in purity, observe in culture, and obtain morphological confirmation of GM <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Difficulties inherent with traditional field/conventional (mycological) laboratory diagnoses can be overcome by molecular techniques.</s><s>Nucleic acid-based diagnostic methods have today become invaluable tools for the early detection of even minute amounts of plant pathogens at an early stage of infection and from a variety of matrices <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>With particular regard to TCD, there have been recent developments in molecular diagnosis of both the fungus and its insect vector.</s><s>Oren et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> utilized species-specific microsatellite loci to set up a molecular protocol to detect both GM and PJ from host tissues.</s><s>The authors of <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> developed target-specific TaqMan-based real-time PCR assays for the detection of 10 harmful pathogens from environmental samples including GM.</s><s>In these studies, the presence of the fungus was investigated on drilled bark samples, or on artificially inoculated greenhouse grown plants and on the insect vector.</s><s>The authors of <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, using simplex/duplex qPCR assays, were able to detect GM and its vector PJ from a variety of matrices including pure fungal mycelium, infected tissue, adults of the vector, and their frass.</s><s>Lastly, the authors of <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> improved pre-existing diagnostic assays used to detect both the fungus and its vector from field samples, developing a user-friendly and costeffective protocol based on traditional gel electrophoresis (conventional gel and blue-light visualization with modifications) and TaqMan probes.</s><s>In the present work, we report two diagnostic protocols based on loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref> and real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR), based on SYBR Green chemistry, to accurately detect the TCD microbial causal agent from infected plant tissue.</s><s>Compared to existing protocols, our methods provide new assay formats for the rapid accurate diagnosis of G. morbida from environmental samples, with the aim of offering the LAMP technique as a specific, portable detection tool to assist in field TCD surveillance.</s></p></div>
