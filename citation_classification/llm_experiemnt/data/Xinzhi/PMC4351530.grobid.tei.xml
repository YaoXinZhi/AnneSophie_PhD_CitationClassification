<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>ACEs apparently have several functions in insects.</s><s>These enzymes have been detected in the testis, mid-gut, brain, hemocyte, and venom of insects <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> .

.</s></p><p><s>Aphids release saliva containing host plant-modulating effectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> .</s></p><p><s>The functions of ACEs as effectors in mediating compatible interactions between aphids and their host plants remain unknown.</s><s>In this study, three putative ACEs from A. pisum genome were identified, and the synergistic functions of ACE1 and ACE2 in facilitating the survival of aphids on host plants were demonstrated.</s><s>Aside from broadening the established knowledge regarding the function of this enzyme in mammal renin-angiotensin system and insect physiological processes, the present study also reveals new insights into the molecular basis of insect-plant interactions.</s><s>The functions of the three ACEs in A. pisum are apparently redundant, but these functions are diverse.</s><s>Although ACE1 is excessively expressed in the salivary glands, aphids do not require additional ACE1 when fed on plants rather than on artificial diet.</s><s>This fact reflects the constitutional expression mode of the gene in salivary glands.</s><s>ACE2 expressions in the salivary glands, brain, and ovaries are comparable.</s><s>ACE2 expression is more prevalent than that of the other two ACEs.</s><s>Additional ACE2 in salivary glands and/or brain are induced upon aphid feeding on plants, thereby exhibiting an inducible expression mode.</s><s>However, decreasing the expression of ACE2 alone does not affect the infestation of aphids on plants.</s><s>Only the simultaneous interferences of the constitutional ACE1 and inducible ACE2 expression have lethal effects, thereby indicating that ACE1 and ACE2 simultaneously function in the salivary glands to successfully secure aphids on host plants.</s><s>ACE3 is predominantly expressed in the ovaries and brain, but this gene does not affect aphid reproduction when knocked down.</s><s>This enzyme probably functions in the neuropeptide processing in aphid brain tissues.</s><s>Another possibility suggests that ACE3 could simultaneously function with ACE2 during aphid reproduction because of their abundant transcripts in the ovaries.</s><s>ACEs affect female insect reproduction.</s><s>ACE inhibitors reduce the fecundity of the female mosquito Anopheles stephensi <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> .</s><s>The presence of yolk protein-related ACE substrates in the ovaries of Neobellieria bullata suggests that ACE is a regulator of the vitellogenic processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> .</s></p><p><s>ACE is a member of the M2 metalloprotease family, which is involved in the digestion of small peptides, such as hormones or neuropeptides.</s><s>Plant phloem sap contains sugars, water, minerals, amino acids, and plant hormones <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</s><s>Among plant hormones, a certain type of peptide hormone is released as a signal molecule to induce defense responses when plants are damaged by herbivorous insects.</s><s>For example, the most known peptide hormone of Solanaceae plants, systemin, has been detected inside the sieve elements of the phloem and transported throughout the plant as a long-distance signal to  activate chemical defenses against herbivores <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> .</s><s>Systemin and jasmonic acid activate the expressions of proteinase inhibitors and other defense-related genes through the same signaling pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> .</s><s>Plant defense against aphids follows the plant-pathogen model, in which compatible hosts are manipulated by the secretion of effector molecules that suppress (or otherwise interfere with) the plant's innate immunity defense <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> .</s><s>Further research is required to determine whether ACEs in aphid saliva can hydrolyze systemin or other signal molecules of peptide hormones that induce plant immune reactions.</s></p><p><s>Aside from the possible involvement in plant peptide hormones, ACEs hydrolyze diverse peptide hormones/transmitters, such as leucokinin, locustatachykinin, and allatostatin within insects <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> .</s><s>Leucokinin and locustatachykinin are myotropic neuropeptides.</s><s>Leucokinin increases the Malpighian tubule fluid secretion and hindgut motility and regulates insect meal size <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> .</s><s>Allatostatins suppress food intake or inhibit feeding behavior in insects <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> .</s><s>In the present study, the simultaneous ACE1 and ACE2 knockdowns increased the fluency of aphid feeding (longer passive ingestion and shorter probing time).</s><s>This study is the first to report that a salivary gland protein exerts a negative effect on the feeding behavior of aphids.</s><s>The well-known effector protein, c002 <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> , and another effector protein, Armet 41 , from A. pisum are essential in maintaining a normal feeding behavior.</s><s>The c002 or Armet knockdowns significantly reduced the contact time of aphids with the phloem sap in sieve elements.</s><s>Therefore, the regulation of the aphid feeding behavior by ACEs that act on endogenous neuropeptides is highly possible.</s></p><p><s>The physiological substrates of ACEs hydrolyzed in vivo have not been fully elucidated in insects, except for the ovary-derived ACE interactive factor Neb-ODAIF from N. bullata <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> .</s><s>ACEs might be involved in the processing of biologically active peptides in aphid saliva or salivary glands.</s><s>To date, information on the possible ACE substrates in aphid salivary glands is lacking.</s><s>Strong ACE activities and antiserum immunoreactions have been reported in the venom from the endoparasitic wasp, Pimpla hypochondriaca <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> .</s><s>An insect homolog of the known mammalian ACE substrate, bradykinin, has been detected in the venom of several solitary scoliid wasps <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref> .</s><s>Further research is needed to determine whether ACE substrates exist in aphid saliva or salivary glands, and to elucidate the mechanisms undergone by the turnover product to facilitate the survival of aphids on plants.</s></p><p><s>ACE homologs from several insects have been studied for their functions, but only a single ACE gene is usually reported in each insect, except in D. melanogaster and B. mori.</s><s>According to the phylogenetic analysis, A. pisum ACE1 is most similar to L. migratoria ACE (AAR85358), B. mori ACEs (BAA97657, BAH23569), and S. littoralis ACE (ABW34729) (Figure <ref type="figure">S2</ref>).</s><s>L. migratoria ACE (AAR85358) is most highly expressed in the testes, followed by the brain, midgut, ovaries, and hemocytes; this gene is least expressed in fat bodies <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> .</s><s>B. mori ACE (BAA97657) is abundant in wing discs at certain developmental stages, and is induced by exposure to 20hydroxyecdysone <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> .</s><s>S. littoralis ACE (ABW34729) is a presumably soluble enzyme, and is expressed throughout the insect life cycle, especially in the brain, gut, and fat body tissues of the last larval stage <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> .</s><s>The present study showed that A. pisum ACE1 was most highly expressed in salivary glands, followed by the brain, ovaries, and gut.</s><s>Although these ACE homologs have considerably similar sequences, their functions could have been diversified within each insect species during evolution.</s></p><p><s>Unlike mammalian ACEs, which are membrane-bound proteins, insect ACEs are generally secreted as soluble proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref> .</s><s>Similar to other insect ACEs, A. pisum ACE1 and ACE2 are putative secretory proteins based on the predicted secretory signal peptide at the Nterminus and no other hydrophobic region.</s><s>However, A. pisum ACE1 is suspected from a non-salivary gland origin and fat bodies can be its source <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> .</s><s>In this study, we illustrated the predominant ACE1 transcripts in salivary glands in comparison with those in the brain, ovaries, and gut.</s><s>We excluded the possibility of a nonsalivary gland origin for ACE1.</s><s>The extracellular secretion of A. pisum ACE3 was not possible because no secretory signal peptide was predicted at the N-terminus.</s><s>The cellular location of this enzyme is difficult to determine because of the limited information on the Cterminus.</s><s>The presence of membrane-bound ACEs in insects is questionable.</s><s>A membrane-bound ACE is enriched in the salivary glands of the adult females of the cattle tick Boophilus microplus <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> .</s></p></div>
